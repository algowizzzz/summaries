Your new CEO Jane Fraser has\ndelivered on all of that \u0096 and more \u0096 and this has defined the\nyear since our last shareholders\u0092 meeting. The assessment by\nJane and her management team focused on the facts that, despite\nthe stubborn lingering of the pandemic and exceptionally low\ninterest rates, in 2021 the company generated $22 billion in\nincome for a 13.4 percent Return on Tangible Common Equity\n(RoTCE); returned nearly $12 billion in capital to you, our\nshareholders; and finished the year with a strong Common Equity\nTier 1 capital ratio of 12.2 percent. The assessment also\nrecognized the unique strength of Citi\u0092s global franchise and\nthe RoTCE strength and potential of a number of our key\nbusinesses, including, among others, Treasury & Trade Solutions,\nGlobal Wealth Management, the Commercial Bank, and core parts of\nour U.S. Personal Banking franchise. Yet the assessment was also\nclear about the firm\u0092s weaknesses, some of them longstanding: a\nbusiness mix that, despite many years of streamlining, remained\noverly complex and allowed our returns gap with competitors to\nremain stubbornly wide; a deficient risk and control environment\nthat not only precipitated consent orders with our regulators,\nbut held back our competitiveness and required substantial\ninvestment to fix; and recent suboptimal financial performance,\nwhich in 2021 produced decreased revenues, increased expenses,\nand an unacceptably low Total Shareholder Return. This\nfoundational assessment caused management, with Board oversight,\nto develop comprehensive plans that are critical to Citi\u0092s\nfuture. The first set of plans addressed the multi-year\nTransformation of Citi\u0092s Risk and Control Environment and was\nsubmitted to our U.S. regulators last fall. These plans are\ndetailed and robust; they holistically embrace the changes that\nthe firm must implement to fix the operations, compliance, and\nreporting problems that have caused repeated risk and control\ndeficiencies; and they require the necessary changes to Citi\u0092s\ntechnology and operations backbone to compete even more\neffectively in our digital future. Jane and her management team\nlaid out the second set of critical plans, on Citi\u0092s refreshed\ncorporate strategy, at the company\u0092s recent Investor Day. Key\nparts of the new strategy include: reducing complexity through\ndivestiture of non- U.S. consumer businesses, primarily in Asia\nand Mexico; simplifying the company to focus on the five core\ninterconnected businesses of services, markets, banking, global\nwealth management, and U.S. personal banking; and making\nsignificantly increased investments in high RoTCE businesses\nsuch as Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services,\nGlobal Wealth Management, and Commercial Banking. Your board of\ndirectors strongly supports the refreshed strategy, even though\nit entails an increase in near term investments and expenses,\nbecause we believe it is the necessary path forward to\nstreamline operations, reduce the cost of capital, decrease\nearnings volatility, and \u0096 most important \u0096 increase Citi\u0092s\noverall RoTCE in a realistic way over time. A third critical\nplan issued by Citi this past year, subject to Board oversight\nand review, focused on concrete steps to address climate change.\nSpecifically, Citi released its initial plan to achieve net zero\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 by establishing hard targets\nfor caps on emissions from our energy and power loan portfolios\nby 2030. These meaningful, ambitious targets are designed to\nenable Citi to facilitate the transition of our clients in these\nindustries to net zero emissions \u0096 with the clear understanding\nthat, as a last resort, Citi would exit relationships with a\ncompany that fails to make that transition. We believe this\ninitial plan strikes the right balance of understanding the near\nterm demand for fossil fuels while at the same time taking\nimmediate action to accelerate the transition to a Net Zero\nfuture. Finally, this past year was also about the pivot to the\nfirst phase of execution on these plans. The planned\ndivestitures of 14 of Citi\u0092s non-U.S. consumer businesses are\nwell underway, with: sales announced for seven franchises at\nattractive prices; the wind-down of operations in Korea\nproceeding; and the announcement of the sale of Banamex\nreceiving a positive response from the Mexican government. Citi\njust announced a 2022 technology budget of $1 billion for our\nvital Treasury and Trade Solutions business, a 40 percent\nincrease over the 2020 spend; our Global Wealth Management\nbusiness expanded substantially with the hiring of more than 400\nnew advisors globally in 2021; and our Commercial Citi 2022\nProxy Statement Table of Contents\n     \n  5  \n     \nBank just announced its intent to hire 400 new bankers over the\nnext three years. Meanwhile, execution is in full swing on the\nfirst phase of the Transformation, with management achieving\nearly milestones to improve the control environment while\nmaintaining close contact with our regulators as we progress to\nlater phases, including with appropriate adjustments to plans.\nLooking to next year and beyond, last year\u2019s heavy emphasis on\nassessment and planning will give way to a predominant focus on\nexecution. As this proceeds, your board will be keenly focused\non management achieving tangible, risk-reducing progress in the\nTransformation, and, in the medium term, significantly and\nsustainably improving Citi\u2019s Return on Tangible Common Equity\nand reducing the returns gap with our main competitors. It has\nbeen an exceptionally active first year for Jane and her\nmanagement team. We believe that their clear-eyed assessment and\ndetailed plans have positioned Citi well for the future. The\npath forward now lies with strong execution. Thank you for your\nongoing support of Citi. Dialogue with stockholders is a\nfundamental feature of a well governed organization, and we will\ncontinue to make it a priority. Please write with any concerns\nor suggestions to: Citigroup Inc.

His insights and guidance as a former  \n  CEO of a large global financial institution, and his          \n  knowledge regarding the business and regulatory environment   \n  in Europe, have been invaluable to Citi.                      \n  Three other directors have determined not to stand for        \n  re-election at the Annual Meeting:                            \n  Lew W. (Jay) Jacobs, IV, brought both extensive financial     \n  services knowledge and human capital management experience    \n  to the Board.  He ably led the Board\u2019s Personnel and          \n  Compensation Committee, while providing thoughtful oversight  \n  of Citi\u2019s institutional business, and we are grateful for     \n  his many contributions to Citi.                               \n  Deborah C. Wright brought her deep experience as the leader   \n  of a minority-owned financial institution to Citi.  We        \n  benefited from her strong support of our community            \n  development efforts over the past five years. We will miss    \n  her commitment and valuable perspectives.                     \n  Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon served on the Board since 2010  \n  and played a critical role in helping lead the company        \n  through the aftermath of the financial crisis.  Drawing on    \n  his experience as the former President of Mexico, he helped   \n  guide Citi in the execution of its strategy in Latin          \n  America.  His expertise in and concern regarding climate      \n  issues have also helped shape Citi\u2019s approach to addressing   \n  climate change.

which builds on the    \n  work we outlined in our updated Sustainable         \n  Progress Strategy. This commitment includes         \n  extending our prior five-year, $250 billion         \n  environmental finance goal to $500 billion by 2030  \n  through which we will finance and facilitate an     \n  array of climate solutions such as renewable        \n  energy, energy efficiency, sustainable              \n  transportation and circular economy and $500        \n  billion in social finance including affordable      \n  housing, diversity and equity, economic inclusion,  \n  food security and healthcare. In 2021, we financed  \n  and facilitated a total of $160 billion in          \n  activities that contribute towards our $1 trillion  \n  commitment.                                         \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Citi\u0092s Net Zero Commitment                           \n  Following the 2021 announcement of our net zero     \n  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions commitment by 2050,  \n  in January 2022, Citi released its initial net      \n  zero plan as part of its Task Force on              \n  Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)        \n  Report, including baseline emissions and 2030       \n  targets for its Energy and Power loan portfolios.   \n  Along with the report, Citi also published a        \n  step-by-step summary detailing how we established   \n  our net zero methodology as well as the Net Zero    \n  Transition Principles that will guide our efforts.  \n  Our 2030 targets for our Energy and Power loan      \n  portfolios include a reduction of 29% absolute      \n  emissions for our Energy portfolio (143.8 million   \n  mt CO2e to 102.1 million mt CO2e) and a 63%         \n  reduction in emissions intensity for our Power      \n  portfolio (313.5 kg CO2e/MWh to 115 kg CO2e/MWh).   \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Implementing the TCFD Recommendations               \n  Citi published its third, dedicated climate         \n  disclosure report, Citi\u0092s Approach to Climate        \n  Change and Net Zero, which describes our            \n  implementation of the TCFD Recommendations. The     \n  report includes:                                    \n  an illustration of our enhanced climate change      \n  governance, ranging from expanded board oversight   \n  to senior engagement across our businesses; our     \n  initial net zero plan; baseline emissions and 2030  \n  targets for our Energy and Power loan portfolios;   \n  an initial screening-level inventory of emissions   \n  associated with our supply chain; and an updated    \n  credit exposure climate risk heat map that          \n  indicates vulnerability levels for various types    \n  of transition and physical risk.                    \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Workforce Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)     \n  Our approach to workforce DEI includes broadening   \n  the representation of those working within the top  \n  levels of our firm, creating a more inclusive       \n  environment and thinking of ways to widen our       \n  impact for our suppliers, clients, customers and    \n  communities we serve. Since 2018, we have           \n  disclosed our adjusted and unadjusted (or \u0093raw\u0094)      \n  pay gaps for both women and United States           \n  minorities and in the same year, we set goals to    \n  increase women leadership globally and Black        \n  leadership in the United States at the firm by the  \n  end of 2021, and Citi has met and exceeded these    \n  goals. In 2021, we also expanded the use of         \n  diverse slates in our recruiting, and under our     \n  campus recruiting program we have a robust          \n  pipeline of talent from Historically Black          \n  Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other         \n  leading universities. To support internal           \n  mobility, we invest in career development and       \n  planning for diverse talent through mentorship,     \n  networking, rotational programs and partnerships    \n  through our global employee resource groups.        \n                                                      \n                                                      \n  Action for Racial Equity                            \n  In September 2020, building on its longstanding     \n  focus on advancing financial inclusion and          \n  economic opportunity for communities of color in    \n  the United States, Citi and the Citi Foundation     \n  announced our Action for Racial Equity to help      \n  close the racial wealth gap and increase economic   \n  mobility. The effort aims to provide greater        \n  access to banking and credit in communities of      \n  color, increase investment in Black-owned           \n  businesses, expand affordable housing and           \n  homeownership among Black Americans and advance     \n  anti-racist practices in our company and the        \n  financial services industry. As part of Action for  \n  Racial Equity, Citi and the Citi Foundation have    \n  already invested more than $1 billion in strategic  \n  initiatives.

The following supplements that discussion\nby highlighting compensation-related developments at Citi during\n2021. Several important developments in 2021 impacted our\ncompensation programs and decisions. First, Jane Fraser became\nour CEO on February 26, 2021. Second, in April 2021, we\nannounced that we will focus our consumer banking franchises in\nAsia and EMEA on four wealth centers and as a result pursue\nexits of our consumer franchises in the remaining 13 markets\nacross the two regions. More recently, we announced our\nintention to exit the consumer, small business and middle market\nbanking operations of Citibanamex. Third, we announced in 2021\nan internal restructuring and formation of our new Global Wealth\nManagement Team, and consistent with those changes we recently\nannounced the creation of two new operating segments - Personal\nBanking and Wealth Management, and Legacy Franchises - in\naddition to our Institutional Clients Group segment. In parallel\nwith these major leadership and transformational developments,\nwe are focused on meeting the expectations of our regulators as\nreflected in the Consent Orders we entered into with the Federal\nReserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(OCC) in October 2020 (Consent Orders). In support of these\nefforts, in 2021 we increased staffing in our risk, audit and\ncompliance functions and other relevant areas, and we continued\nto make enhancements to our compensation process to ensure the\nstrongest possible link between performance and pay, address the\nissues raised by regulators and provide transparency to\ninvestors.\n                                                                \n  In prior years, some of the mandatorily                       \n  deferred                                                      \n  portion of annual bonuses (Deferral Awards)                   \n  for                                                           \n  certain employees was paid out in cash, with                  \n  interest. For Deferral Awards arising from                    \n  2021                                                          \n  annual bonuses, 100% of deferrals for all                     \n  employees eligible for annual discretionary                   \n  bonuses will be paid in Citi stock, where                     \n  local                                                         \n  regulations permit.

Those changes mean\nthat close to a third of our employees are new to the\norganization or to their roles. The changes are driven by Citi\u2019s\ninvestments in key markets and products, ongoing Transformation\nefforts and a highly competitive talent market globally. A\nsignificant and growing portion of the roles were not entry\nlevel. We added programs to address the challenges arising from\nthese changes to our workforce, including implementing new\nsurveys to gather feedback and other integration efforts. At the\nsame time, through increased efforts in our recruiting processes\nwe were able to increase the share of diverse candidates that we\ninterviewed by 26% in 2021. www.citigroup.com\n\nTable of Contents\n      \n  22  \n      \nCorporate Governance Citi continually strives to maintain the\nhighest standards of ethical conduct: reporting results with\naccuracy and transparency and maintaining full compliance with\nthe laws, rules, and regulations that govern Citi\u2019s businesses.\nCiti is active in ensuring its governance practices are at the\nleading edge of best practices.

The 2021 Annual Report is also available on Citi\u2019s\nwebsite at www.citigroup.com. We urge you to read these\ndocuments carefully. In accordance with the SEC\u2019s rules, the\nFive-Year Performance Graph appears in the 2021 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, which is included in Citi\u2019s Annual Report to\nStockholders for 2021. Corporate Governance Guidelines Citi\u2019s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines (the Guidelines) embody many of\nour long-standing practices, policies, and procedures, which are\nthe foundation of our commitment to best practices. The\nGuidelines are reviewed at least annually, and revised as\nnecessary, to continue to reflect best practices. The full text\nof the Guidelines, as approved by the Board, is set forth on\nCiti\u2019s website at www.citigroup.com. Click on \u201cAbout Us,\u201d then\n\u201cCorporate Governance,\u201d and then \u201cCorporate Governance\nGuidelines.\u201d The Guidelines outline the responsibilities,\noperations, qualifications, and composition of the Board. The\nfollowing summarizes certain provisions of the Guidelines.\nDirector Independence Our goal is that at least two-thirds of\nthe members of the Board be independent. Descriptions of our\nindependence criteria and the results of the Board\u2019s\nindependence determinations are set forth below. Board\nCommittees The Guidelines require that all members of the\nfollowing committees of the Board: Audit; Nomination, Governance\nand Public Affairs; and Personnel and Compensation be\nindependent. Committee members are appointed by the Board upon\nthe recommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee. Committee membership and Chairs are rotated\nperiodically. The Board and each Committee have the power to\nhire and fire independent legal, financial, or other advisors,\nas they may deem necessary, without consulting or obtaining the\napproval of management. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                            \n  24  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nAdditional Board Service The number of other for-profit public\nor non-public company boards on which a Director may serve is\nsubject to review and approval by the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee, in order to ensure that each Director\nis able to devote sufficient time to perform his or her duties\nas a Director. Change in Status or Responsibilities If a\nDirector has a substantial change in professional\nresponsibilities, occupation, or business association, he or she\nis required to notify the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee and to offer his or her resignation from the\nBoard. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\nwill evaluate the facts and circumstances and make a\nrecommendation to the Board whether to accept the resignation or\nrequest that the Director continue to serve on the Board. If a\nDirector assumes a significant role in a not-for-profit entity,\nhe or she is asked to notify the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee. Attendance at Meetings Directors are\nexpected to attend Board meetings and meetings of the Committees\non which they serve and the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All\nof the Directors then in office attended Citi\u2019s 2021 Virtual\nAnnual Meeting. Evaluation of Board Performance The Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee conducts an annual\nreview of Board performance in which the full Board\nparticipates, and each standing committee (except for the\nExecutive Committee) conducts its own self-evaluation. As part\nof the self-evaluation, the Board engages in an examination of\nits own performance of its obligations with regard to such\nmatters as regulatory requirements, strategic and financial\noversight, oversight of risk management, executive compensation,\nsuccession planning, and governance, among many other topics.\nThe committees evaluate their performance against the\nrequirements of their charters and other aspects of their\nresponsibilities. The full Board and each committee then discuss\nthe results of their respective self-evaluations in executive\nsession, highlighting actions to be taken in response to the\ndiscussion. See Board Self-Assessment Process on page 31 for\nfurther information. Directors Access to Senior Management and\nDirector Orientation Directors have full and free access to\nsenior management and other employees of Citi. New Directors are\nprovided with an orientation program to familiarize them with\nCiti\u2019s businesses, regions, and functions as well as its legal,\ncompliance, regulatory, and risk profile. Citi provides\neducational sessions on a variety of topics throughout the year\nfor all members of the Board. These sessions are designed to\nallow Directors to, for example, develop a deeper understanding\nof a business issue or a complex financial product. Succession\nPlanning The Board reviews the Personnel and Compensation\nCommittee\u2019s report on the performance of senior executives in\norder to ensure that they are providing the highest quality\nleadership for Citi. The Board also works with the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee to evaluate potential\nsuccessors to the CEO. With respect to regular succession of the\nCEO and senior management, Citi\u2019s Board evaluates internal, and,\nwhen appropriate, external candidates. To find external\ncandidates, Citi seeks input from the members of the Board,\nsenior management, and from recruiting firms. To develop\ninternal candidates, Citi engages in a number of practices,\nformal and informal, designed to familiarize the Board with\nCiti\u2019s talent pool. The formal process involves an annual talent\nreview conducted by senior management at which the Board studies\nthe most promising members of senior management. The Board\nlearns about each person\u2019s experience, skills, areas of\nexpertise, accomplishments, and Citi 2022 Proxy Statement Table\nof Contents\n                            \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  25  \n                            \ngoals. This review is conducted at a regularly scheduled Board\nmeeting on an annual basis. In addition, members of senior\nmanagement are periodically asked to make presentations to the\nBoard at Board meetings and Board strategy sessions. These\npresentations are made by senior managers of the various\nbusiness units as well as those who serve in corporate\nfunctions. The purpose of the formal review and other\ninteraction is to ensure that Board members are familiar with\nthe talent pool inside and outside Citi from which the Board\nwould be able to choose successors to the CEO and evaluate\nsuccession for other senior managers as necessary from time to\ntime. Charitable Contributions If a Director, or an immediate\nfamily member who shares the Director\u2019s household, serves as a\ndirector, trustee, or executive officer of a foundation,\nuniversity, or other not-for-profit organization, and such\nentity receives contributions from Citi and/or the Citi\nFoundation, such contributions must be reported to the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee at least\nannually. Insider Investments and Transactions Members of Citi\u2019s\nBoard of Directors and Citi\u2019s executive officers (i.e., Section\n16 Insiders) are not permitted to hedge their Citi securities or\nto pledge their Citi securities as collateral for a loan. The\nGuidelines restrict certain financial transactions between Citi\nand its subsidiaries on the one hand and Directors, senior\nmanagement, and their immediate family members on the other.\nPersonal loans from Citi or its subsidiaries to Citi\u2019s Directors\nand its most senior executives, or immediate family members who\nshare any such person\u2019s household, are prohibited, except for\nmargin loans to employees of a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi,\nmortgage loans, home equity loans, consumer loans, credit cards,\nand overdraft checking privileges, all made on market terms in\nthe ordinary course of business. See Certain Transactions and\nRelationships, Compensation Committee Interlocks, and Insider\nParticipation on pages 39-41. The Guidelines prohibit\ninvestments or transactions by Citi or its executive officers\nand those immediate family members who share an executive\nofficer\u2019s household in a partnership or other privately held\nentity in which an outside Director is a principal, or in a\npublicly traded company in which an outside Director owns or\ncontrols more than a 10% interest. Directors and those immediate\nfamily members who share the Director\u2019s household are not\npermitted to receive initial public offering allocations.\nDirectors and their immediate family members may participate in\nCiti-sponsored investment activities, provided they are offered\non the same terms as those offered to similarly situated non-\naffiliated persons. Under certain circumstances, or with the\napproval of the appropriate committee, members of senior\nmanagement may participate in certain Citi-sponsored investment\nopportunities. Finally, there is a prohibition on certain\ninvestments by Directors and executive officers in third-party\nentities when the opportunity comes solely as a result of their\nposition with Citi. Director Independence The Board has adopted\ncategorical standards to assist the Board in evaluating the\nindependence of each of its Directors. The categorical\nstandards, which are set forth below, describe various types of\nrelationships that could potentially exist between a Director or\nan immediate family member of a Director and Citi, and set\nthresholds at which such relationships would be deemed to be\nmaterial. Provided that no relationship or transaction exists\nthat would disqualify a Director under the categorical standards\nand no other relationships or transactions exist of a type not\nspecifically mentioned in the categorical standards that, in the\nBoard\u2019s opinion, taking into account all facts and\ncircumstances, would impair a Director\u2019s ability to exercise his\nor her independent judgment, the Board will deem such person to\nbe independent. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                            \n  26  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nThe Board and the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee reviewed certain information obtained from Directors\u2019\nresponses to a questionnaire asking about their relationships\nwith Citi, and those of their immediate family members and\nprimary business or charitable affiliations and other potential\nconflicts of interest, as well as certain data collected by\nCiti\u2019s businesses related to transactions, relationships, or\narrangements between Citi on the one hand and a Director,\nimmediate family member of a Director, or a primary business or\ncharitable affiliation of a Director, on the other. The Board\nreviewed certain relationships or transactions between the\nDirectors or immediate family members of the Directors or their\nprimary business or charitable affiliations and Citi and\ndetermined that the relationships or transactions complied with\nthe Corporate Governance Guidelines and the related categorical\nstandards. The Board also determined that, applying the\nGuidelines and standards, which are intended to comply with the\nNYSE corporate governance rules, and all other applicable laws,\nrules, and regulations, each of the following Director nominees\nstanding for re-election is independent:\n                                                                \n  \u25cfEllen M.

Ms. Fraser is our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Ms. Desoer previously served as the Chief Executive\nOfficer of Citibank, N.A., our largest banking subsidiary. The\nBoard has also determined that current directors Lew W. (Jay)\nJacobs, Deborah C. Wright and Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who\nare not standing for re-election as directors at the 2022 Annual\nMeeting, are independent. Independence Standards To be\nconsidered independent, a Director must meet the following\ncategorical standards as adopted by our Board and reflected in\nour Corporate Governance Guidelines.

During 2021, Mr. Dugan presided at\neach executive session of the non-management Directors. In\naddition, the independent Directors met in executive session\nduring 2021. Board Leadership Structure Citi currently has an\nindependent Chair separate from the CEO, a structure that has\nbeen in place since 2009. The Board believes it is important to\nmaintain flexibility in its Board leadership structure and has\nhad in place different leadership structures in the past,\ndepending on the Company\u2019s needs at the time, but firmly\nsupports having an independent Director in a Board leadership\nposition at all times. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s Board, on December\n15, 2009, adopted a By-law amendment which provides that if Citi\ndoes not have an independent Chair, the Board will elect a lead\nindependent Director having similar duties to an independent\nChair, including leading the executive sessions of the non-\nmanagement Directors at Board meetings. Citi\u2019s Chair provides\nindependent leadership of the Board. Having an independent Chair\nor Lead Director enables non-management Directors to raise\nissues and concerns for Board consideration without immediately\ninvolving management. The Chair or Lead Director also serves as\na liaison between the Board and senior management. Citi\u2019s Board\nhas determined that the current structure, an independent Chair\nseparate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure at this\ntime, while ensuring that, at all times, there will be an\nindependent Director in a Board leadership position. The Board\nbelieves its approach to risk oversight, including, importantly,\nhaving a standing Risk Management Committee and the reporting\nline of the Chief Risk Officer to the Risk Management Committee,\nensures that the Board can choose many leadership structures\nwithout experiencing a material impact on its oversight of risk.\n                                                 \n  Citi has had an independent Chair since 2009.  \n                                                 \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                            \n  30  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nBoard Diversity Diversity is among the critical factors that the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee considers\nwhen evaluating the composition of the Board. For a Company like\nCiti, which operates in more than 100 countries around the\nglobe, diversity includes race, ethnicity, nationality, and\ngender as well as the diversity of the communities and\ngeographies in which Citi operates. Included in the\nqualifications for Directors listed in the Company\u0092s Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines is \u0093whether the candidate has special\nskills, expertise and background that would complement the\nattributes of the existing Directors, taking into consideration\nthe diverse communities and geographies in which Citi operates.\u0094\nCiti\u0092s Board is committed to ensuring that it is composed of\nindividuals whose backgrounds reflect the diversity represented\nby our employees, customers, and stakeholders. When considering\nnew Director candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to include\ndiverse candidates in each slate. The candidates nominated for\nelection at Citi\u0092s 2022 Annual Meeting exemplify that diversity:\nseven nominees are women and one nominee is racially diverse. In\naddition, each Director candidate contributes to the Board\u0092s\noverall diversity by providing a variety of perspectives,\npersonal and professional experiences, and backgrounds, as well\nas other characteristics, such as global and international\nbusiness experience. The Board believes that the current\nnominees reflect an appropriate diversity of gender, age, race,\nnational origin, geographical background, and experience and is\ncommitted to continuing to consider diversity in evaluating the\ncomposition of the Board. Director Education Program Citi has a\nrobust Director Education Program that begins with an\norientation for newly appointed Directors, providing two days of\nin-depth training covering all aspects of our business,\nincluding, among other things, coverage of Citi\u0092s institutional\nand consumer businesses; our regional operations; an overview of\nthe Company\u0092s risk management, audit, compliance, operations and\ntechnology, governance, regulatory, finance, human capital\nmanagement, government affairs, and legal functions; and an\noverview of Citi\u0092s primary banking subsidiary, Citibank, N.A.\nThere is also a continuing education program, which includes\npresentations focusing on industry, regulatory and governance\ntopics and presentations from the various lines of our business\non emerging issues or strategic initiatives to provide our\nDirectors with the opportunity to expand their insight into\nCiti\u0092s business operations and activities. Directors also have\naccess to external programming and seminars to supplement their\nCiti-provided education. In 2021, the Directors received\ntraining on various topics, including certain complex business\nproducts like Digital Currencies, Cybersecurity, Climate Change,\nRegulation O, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending, AML, and\nResolution and Recovery Planning among other topics.

Specifically, the activities that\nCiti engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must\nbe consistent with Citi\u0092s Mission and Value Proposition and the\nkey principles that guide it, as well as Citi\u0092s risk appetite.\nThe Citigroup Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of\nrisk management and holds the Executive Management Team\naccountable for implementing the Enterprise Risk Management\n(ERM) Framework and meeting strategic objectives within Citi\u0092s\nrisk appetite. The Board of Directors formed the Transformation\nOversight Committee to oversee management\u0092s efforts to improve\nour risk and control environment, and oversee the FRB Order, as\nwell as to monitor management\u0092s progress as it relates to the\nbroader transformation of Citi. (Please see page 33 to review\nadditional disclosure on the Transformation Oversight\nCommittee.) Citi has established an ERM Framework to ensure that\nall of Citi\u0092s risks are managed appropriately and consistently\nacross Citi and at an aggregate, enterprise-wide level. The ERM\nFramework details the principles used to support effective\nenterprise-wide risk management across the end-to-end risk\nmanagement lifecycle. The ERM Framework also provides clarity on\nthe expected activities in relation to risk management of the\nCitigroup Board of Directors, Citi\u0092s Executive Management Team\nand employees across the lines of defense. Citi uses a lines of\ndefense model as a key component of its ERM Framework to manage\nits risks. The lines of defense model brings together risk-\ntaking, risk oversight and risk assurance under one umbrella and\nprovides an avenue for risk accountability of the first line of\ndefense, a construct for effective challenge by the second line\nof defense (Independent Risk Management and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management), and empowers independent risk\nassurance by the third line of defense (Internal Audit). In\naddition, Citi has enterprise support functions that support\nsafety and soundness across Citi. Each of the lines of defense\nand enterprise support functions, along with the Board, are\nempowered to perform relevant risk management processes and\nresponsibilities in order to manage Citi\u0092s risks in a consistent\nand effective manner.

a\nrisk report from the Chief Risk Officer with respect to the\nCompany\u0092s approach to management of major risks, including\nmanagement\u0092s risk mitigation efforts, where appropriate.\nIndependent Risk Management, led by the Chief Risk Officer sets\nrisk and control standards for the first line of defense and\nactively manages and oversees aggregate credit, market (trading\nand non-trading), liquidity, strategic, operational and\nreputation risks across Citi, including risks that span\ncategories, such as concentration risk, country risk and climate\nrisk. The Board\u0092s role is to oversee this effort. The Risk\nManagement Committee enhances the Board\u0092s oversight of risk\nmanagement. The Committee\u0092s role is one of oversight,\nrecognizing that management is responsible for executing Citi\u0092s\nrisk management policies. Transformation Enhancements at Citi\nCiti is fully committed to a broad-based transformation of its\nrisk management and controls. Citi believes the Transformation\nis essential, not only to address regulatory matters in an\neffective, timely, and sustainable manner, but also as a broader\nstrategic imperative for the firm. Citi\u0092s priorities revolve\naround three interconnected elements: the Transformation,\nstrategy, and culture and talent. Driving toward excellence in\nrisk and controls in the Transformation is mutually reinforcing\nwith Citi\u0092s business strategy, and success for both can only be\nachieved with significant shifts in culture and talent. The\nBoard established the Transformation Oversight Committee in\nOctober 2020, to serve as the primary forum for Board oversight\nof the Transformation. Given this overall responsibility of the\nTransformation Oversight Committee and the need for holistic\noversight, all non-management directors on the Board serve on\nthe Committee. The full Board focuses on non-Transformation\nmatters in its other meetings. A series of Program Groups focus\non specific requirements of the Consent Order. Members of the\nTransformation Oversight Committee work closely with the\nExecutive Management Team members responsible for the relevant\nProgram Groups to provide oversight and challenge to the Program\nGroups as they prepare for meetings with the entire\nTransformation Oversight Committee, in much the same way as\nBoard Committee Chairs interact with individual Executive\nManagement Team members in preparation for committee meetings.\nBoard\u0092s Role in Cybersecurity Oversight The Board of Directors\nprovides oversight of management\u0092s efforts to mitigate\ncybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents. The Board\nreceives regular reports on cybersecurity and engages in\ndiscussions throughout the year with management and subject-\nmatter experts on the effectiveness of Citi\u0092s overall\ncybersecurity program, Citi\u0092s inherent cybersecurity risks, the\nroad map for addressing these risks, and Citi\u0092s progress in\ndoing so. Board and Committee members receive contemporaneous\nreporting on significant cyber events including response, legal\nobligations, and outreach and notification to regulators, and\ncustomers when needed, as well as guidance to management as\nappropriate. In 2021, the Risk Management Committee approved a\nstandalone Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement against which\nCiti\u0092s performance is measured quarterly. Board\u0092s Role in ESG\nMatters Citi's Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of\nCiti's work to identify, assess and integrate ESG and\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities throughout Citi.\nIn addition to oversight by the full Board, the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee (NGPAC) of the Board\noversees Citi's ESG activity, including reviewing our policies\nand programs for sustainability, climate change, human rights,\ndiversity and other ESG matters. The Risk Management Committee\nof the Board reviews key risk policies, including those related\nto environmental, social and climate risk. The Ethics, Conduct\nand Culture Committee oversees management's efforts to reinforce\nand enhance a culture of ethics throughout the firm. In 2020\ninto 2021, the NGPAC reviewed and discussed investor and market\ndevelopments related to net zero, including a shareholder\nproposal pertaining to net zero, and considerations for Citi as\nit deliberated on the implications of a potential net zero\ncommitment. These discussions continued with the full Board\nthroughout 2021.

The Board also\nreceived reports from the Head of Community Investing and\nDevelopment on Citi and the Citi Foundation\u2019s social impact\nactivities and performance, including Action for Racial Equity\nand the investments of the Citi Impact Fund. In addition, the\nBoard received reports on Citi\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion\nefforts, including pay equity and representation goals, from the\nGlobal Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer and Global\nHead of Talent. Members of the Board also participated in\ninvestor calls on a variety of governance, environmental and\nsocial matters, including climate risk.

Indebtedness Other than\ncertain \u201cgrandfathered\u201d margin loans, in accordance with\nSarbanes-Oxley and the Citi Corporate Governance Guidelines, no\nmargin loans may be made to any executive officer unless such\nperson is an employee of a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi and\nsuch loan is made in the ordinary course of business. Certain\ntransactions in excess of $120,000 involving loans, deposits,\ncredit cards, and sales of commercial paper, certificates of\ndeposit, and other money market instruments and certain other\nbanking transactions occurred during 2021 between Citibank, N.A.\nand other Citi banking subsidiaries on the one hand, and certain\nDirectors or executive officers of Citi, members of their\nimmediate families, corporations or organizations of which any\nof them is an executive officer or partner or of which any of\nthem is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of any class of\nsecurities, or associates of the Directors, the executive\nofficers or their family members, on the other. The transactions\nwere made in the ordinary course of business on substantially\nthe same terms, including interest rates and collateral, that\nprevailed at the time for comparable transactions with other\npersons not related to the lender and did not involve more than\nthe normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable\nfeatures. Personal loans made to any Director or an executive\nofficer must comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, Regulation O, and the\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, and must be made in the\nordinary course of business. Citi\u2019s Hedging Policies Citi\u2019s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines prohibit the hedging of Citi\ncommon stock held by directors and executive officers, whether\nthe shares of stock are granted as compensation or are otherwise\nheld by the director or executive officer. For this purpose, an\nexecutive officer means any person designated by Citi as an\n\u201cofficer\u201d under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Citi\u2019s Code of\nConduct, which applies to all Citi employees, executive officers\nand directors, states that when considering personal investments\nin Citi securities, an individual must avoid any personal trade\nor investment in a security, derivative, futures contract,\ncommodity, or other financial instrument if the trade or\ninvestment might affect or appear to affect the individual\u2019s\nability to make unbiased business decisions for Citi.\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                            \n  42  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                            \nIn addition, Citi\u2019s Personal Trading and Investment Policy (the\nPTIP) prohibits the hedging in any manner (other than currency\nhedges) by Covered Persons (including directors and executive\nofficers) of unvested restricted stock or deferred stock awarded\nas compensation under Citi\u2019s Capital Accumulation Program. The\nPTIP also prohibits engaging in speculative transactions in Citi\nsecurities, including sales of naked calls and speculative\noption strategies, as well as any other transaction that would\nbenefit from a decline in the value of a Citi security. The PTIP\ngenerally allows Covered Persons (excluding directors and\nexecutive officers) to hedge vested long positions of then\ndeliverable Citi securities. Covered Persons under the PTIP\ninclude (but are not limited to) individuals who 1) may have\naccess to material non-public information regarding Citi, 2) are\nemployed by Citi\u2019s Institutional Clients Group, 3) are FINRA-\nregistered employees or associates of any of Citi\u2019s U.S. broker\ndealer entities, or 4) work in a securities or advisory business\nin Citi Personal Wealth Management, as well as certain\nindividuals who are related to Covered Persons. Because\ndirectors and executive officers who are Covered Persons under\nthe PTIP are also subject to the hedging policy applicable to\ndirectors and executive officers pursuant to the Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, a proposed transaction by a director or\nexecutive officer may be prohibited by application of one policy\neven if the transaction would be permissible under the other\npolicy. Finally, Citi maintains policies specific to U.K. and\nEuropean regulatory requirements. These policies provide that\nall employees in the applicable countries who receive a portion\nof their remuneration in stock or any other deferral mechanism\ndesignated by Citi must not take out insurance contracts or\nengage in personal hedging strategies, or remuneration or\nliability-related contracts of insurance, that undermine, or may\nundermine, any risk alignment effects of their remuneration\narrangements. Reputation Risk Committees The Reputation Risk\nCommittees govern the process by which material reputation risks\nare identified, managed, and escalated, and oversee that\nappropriate actions are taken in line with the firmwide\nstrategic objectives, risk appetite thresholds, and regulatory\nexpectations, while promoting a culture of risk awareness and\nhigh standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the\ncompany, consistent with Citi\u2019s Mission and Value Proposition.\nRegional and Business Reputation Risk Committees may escalate\nreputation risks for due consideration by the Group Reputation\nRisk Committee at the corporate level. The Group Reputation Risk\nCommittee may escalate risks to the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee of the Board or another Committee of\nthe Board, as appropriate.

The Board and executive\nofficers are subject to a stock ownership commitment, which\nrequires these individuals to maintain a minimum ownership level\nof Citigroup stock. Executive officers are required to retain at\nleast 75% of the equity awarded to them as incentive\ncompensation (net of amounts required to pay taxes and option\nexercise prices) as long as they are executive officers. In\naddition, a stock holding period applies after the executive\nofficer leaves Citi, or is no longer an executive officer. He or\nshe must retain, for one year after ending executive officer\nstatus, 50% of the shares previously subject to the stock\nownership commitment. Directors are similarly required to retain\nat least 75% of the net equity awarded to them, further aligning\ntheir interests with stockholders. The Board may revise the\nterms of the stock ownership commitment from time to time to\nreflect legal and business developments warranting a change. In\naddition, Directors and executive officers may not enter into\nhedging transactions in respect of Citi\u2019s common stock or other\nsecurities issued by Citi, including securities granted by the\nCompany to the Director or executive officer as part of his or\nher compensation and securities purchased or acquired by the\nDirector or executive officer in a non-compensatory transaction.\nFor more information on hedging, please see Citi\u2019s Hedging\nPolicies on pages 41-42.

The Board has nominated\nall of the current Directors for re-election at the 2022 Annual\nMeeting, except for Lew W. (Jay) Jacobs, Deborah C. Wright and\nErnesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who decided not to stand for re-\nelection. Directors are not eligible to stand for re-election\nafter reaching the age of 72. If elected, each nominee will hold\noffice until the 2023 Annual Meeting or until his or her\nsuccessor is elected and qualified. Director Criteria and\nNomination Process The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee considers all qualified candidates identified by\nmembers of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee, by other members of the Board, by senior management,\nand by security holders. During 2021, the Committee engaged Egon\nZehnder to assist in identifying and evaluating potential\nnominees. Stockholders who would like to propose a Director\ncandidate for consideration by the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee may do so by submitting the candidate\u2019s\nname, r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and biographical information to the attention of\nthe Corporate Secretary, Citigroup Inc., 388 Greenwich Street,\nNew York, New York 10013. All proposals for nominations received\nby the Corporate Secretary will be presented to the Committee\nfor its consideration. In considering the composition of the\nBoard of Directors, the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee inventories the categories of risks faced by\nCiti, given its size, business mix, and geographical presence,\nand seeks to identify candidates with the skills and experience\nnecessary to enable the Board of Directors to provide proper\noversight of those risks. The Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee also takes Director tenure into consideration\nwhen making Director nomination decisions and believes that it\nis desirable to maintain a mix of longer-tenured, experienced\nDirectors and newer Directors with fresh perspectives. The\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and the\nBoard also believe that longer-tenured, experienced Directors\nare a significant strength of the Board, given the large size of\nour Company, the breadth of our product offerings, and the\ninternational scope of our organization. When nominating new\ndirector candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to include\ndiverse candidates in each slate. The Board\u2019s composition, and\nthe individuals nominated for consideration by stockholders, are\nthe result of careful consideration by the Committee of the\ncorrespondence between the risk inventory and skills and\nexperience of the Board members and candidates. In addition to\nthe ability to assist the Board in its oversight of a particular\nrisk or risks, as more fully described in each nominee\u2019s\nbiography, the members of the Board are assessed based on a\nvariety of factors, including the following criteria, which have\nbeen developed by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee and approved by the Board:\n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate has exhibited behavior that          \n  \u25cf  indicates he or she is committed to the highest ethical    \n     standards;                                                 \n     Whether the candidate has had business, governmental,      \n     non-profit or professional experience at the chair, chief  \n     executive officer, chief operating officer, or equivalent  \n     policy-making and operational level of a large             \n     organization with significant international activities     \n  \u25cf  across many regulatory jurisdictions and regions that      \n     indicates that the candidate will be able to make a        \n     meaningful and immediate contribution to the Board\u2019s       \n     discussion of and decision-making on the array of complex  \n     issues facing a large financial services business that     \n     operates on a global scale;                                \n     Whether the candidate has special skills, expertise and a  \n     diverse background that would complement the attributes    \n  \u25cf  of the existing Directors, taking into consideration the   \n     diverse communities and geographies in which the Company   \n     operates;                                                  \n     Whether the candidate has the financial expertise          \n  \u25cf  required to provide effective oversight of a diversified   \n     financial services business that operates on a global      \n     scale;                                                     \n     Whether the candidate has achieved prominence in his or    \n     her business, governmental, or professional activities     \n  \u25cf  and has built a reputation that demonstrates the ability   \n     to make the kind of important and sensitive judgments      \n     that the Board is called upon to make;                     \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                         \n  48  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                         \n                                                                \n     Whether the candidate will effectively, consistently, and  \n     appropriately take into account and balance the            \n  \u25cf  legitimate interests and concerns of all of the Company\u2019s  \n     stockholders and other stakeholders in reaching            \n     decisions, rather than advancing the interests of a        \n     particular constituency;                                   \n     Whether the candidate possesses a willingness to           \n  \u25cf  challenge management while working constructively as part  \n     of a team in an environment of collegiality and trust;     \n     and                                                        \n     Whether the candidate will be able to devote sufficient    \n  \u25cf  time and energy to the performance of his or her duties    \n     as a Director.                                             \n                                                                \nApplication of these factors involves the exercise of judgment\nby the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and\nthe Board. In addition, see Board Diversity on page 30 for\nadditional factors considered by the Board when selecting\ncandidates. Based on its assessment of each candidate\u2019s\nindependence, skills and qualifications and the criteria\ndescribed above, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee will make recommendations regarding potential Director\ncandidates to the Board. The Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee follows the same process and uses the same\ncriteria for evaluating candidates proposed by stockholders,\nmembers of the Board of Directors, and members of senior\nmanagement. For the 2022 Annual Meeting, Citi did not receive\nnotice from any stockholders regarding a nomination to the Board\nof Directors. Director Qualifications The nominees for the Board\nof Directors each have the qualifications and experience to\napprove and guide Citi\u2019s strategy and to oversee management\u2019s\nexecution of that strategic vision. Citi\u2019s Board of Directors\nconsists of individuals with the skills, experience, and diverse\nbackgrounds necessary to oversee Citi\u2019s efforts toward becoming\na simpler, smaller, safer, and stronger financial institution,\nwhile mitigating risk and operating within a complex financial\nand regulatory environment. The nominees listed below are\nleaders in business, the financial community, and academia\nbecause of their intellectual acumen and analytical skills,\nstrategic vision, ability to lead and inspire others to work\nwith them, and records of outstanding accomplishments over a\nperiod of decades. Each has been chosen to stand for election in\npart because of his or her ability and willingness to ask\ndifficult questions, understand Citi\u2019s unique challenges, and\nevaluate the strategies proposed by management, as well as their\nimplementation. Each of the nominees has a long record of\nprofessional integrity, a dedication to his or her profession\nand community, a strong work ethic that includes a commitment to\ncoming fully prepared to meetings and being willing to spend the\ntime and effort needed to fulfill professional obligations and\nthe ability to maintain a collegial environment. Many of our\nnominees are either current or former chief executive officers\nor chairs of other large international corporations or have\nexperience leading and operating large, complex academic or\ngovernmental departments. As such, they have a deep\nunderstanding of, and extensive experience in, many of the areas\nthat are outlined below as being of critical importance to\nCiti\u2019s proper operation and success.

The\nCommittee has determined it is critically important to Citi\u2019s\nproper operation and success that its Board has, in addition to\nthe qualities described above, expertise and experience in the\nfollowing areas:\n                                                      \n  Citi\u2019s Personnel and Compensation Committee is      \n  responsible for determining the compensation of     \n  the CEO and approving the compensation of other     \n  executive officers of the Company and the           \n  Executive Management Team. In order to properly     \n  carry out its responsibilities with respect to      \n  compensation, Citi\u2019s Board must include members     \n  who have experience evaluating the structure of     \n  compensation for senior executives. They must       \n  understand the various forms of compensation that   \n  can be utilized, the purpose of each type and how   \n  various elements of compensation can be used to     \n  motivate and reward executives and drive            \n  performance, while not encouraging imprudent        \n  risk-taking or simply having short-term goals.      \n  Citi\u2019s Personal Banking and Wealth Management, a    \n  global leader in banking, credit cards and wealth   \n  management, is a critical growth engine for Citi.   \n  Globally, Citi continues to introduce               \n  industry-leading digital capabilities, redesign     \n  the client experience, and embed its services in    \n  the most popular social and e-commerce platforms,   \n  enabling customers to bank anytime, anywhere, on    \n  their channel of choice. Citi looks to its Board    \n  members with extensive consumer experience to       \n  assist it in evaluating its business model and      \n  strategies for reaching and servicing its retail    \n  customers domestically and around the world. It is  \n  critically important that its Board include         \n  members who have consumer-oriented and financial    \n  services backgrounds.                               \n  Citi aspires to the highest standards of corporate  \n  governance and ethical conduct:                     \n  doing what we say, reporting results with accuracy  \n  and transparency, and maintaining compliance with   \n  the laws, rules, and regulations that govern the    \n  Company\u2019s businesses. The Board is responsible for  \n  shaping corporate governance policies and           \n  practices, including adopting the corporate         \n  governance guidelines applicable to the Company     \n  and monitoring the Company\u2019s compliance with        \n  governance policies and the guidelines. To carry    \n  out these responsibilities, the Board must include  \n  experienced leaders in the area of corporate        \n  governance who must be familiar with governance     \n  issues, the constituencies most interested in       \n  those issues, and the impact that governance        \n  policies have on the functioning of a company.      \n  Citi has a long history as a technology             \n  innovator\u2014Citibank, N.A. was one of the first       \n  banks to offer automatic teller machines for its    \n  customers during the 1970s. As Citi deploys new     \n  technology and platform innovations to gather,      \n  process, analyze, and provide information to        \n  execute transactions and meet the needs of its      \n  clients and customers, Citi must ensure that its    \n  operations are efficient and there is a continuous  \n  focus on enhancing productivity to meet its         \n  operational and strategic goals, while mitigating   \n  technology risks through efforts to improve         \n  cybersecurity, data privacy, and data management    \n  efforts. The Board must include members who have    \n  knowledge and experience in technology, including   \n  such technology-centric issues as cybersecurity,    \n  data privacy and data management. Members of the    \n  Board must be qualified to provide oversight of     \n  the development and maintenance of Citi\u2019s           \n  technology platforms; Citi\u2019s compliance with        \n  regulatory requirements; Citi\u2019s operational         \n  efficiency and productivity strategies; the         \n  operations and reliability of Citi\u2019s systems; and   \n  the protection of client and customer data.         \n                                                      \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                         \n  50  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                         \n                                                                \n  ESG is a critical business issue, with ties to                \n  both risk and opportunity. Citi has been engaged              \n  in sustainability for over 20 years and views the             \n  environment and sustainability performance and                \n  transparency as an important aspect of stockholder            \n  and broader stakeholder value. Citi communicates              \n  its sustainability and ESG efforts to                         \n  stockholders, clients and other stakeholders,                 \n  including its achievements in the areas of                    \n  environmental sustainability, climate change, net             \n  zero oversight, community investment and                      \n  development, and human rights. Environmental and              \n  social issues have the potential to impede                    \n  corporate plans and long-term performance, and                \n  also the ability to generate new business, which              \n  is why it is necessary to have a                              \n  sustainability-competent Board. Citi\u2019s Board must             \n  include members with experience in the areas of               \n  climate change and finance, community development,            \n  corporate social responsibility and other ESG                 \n  issues to help Citi navigate these complex and                \n  quickly evolving issues and to assist management              \n  in evaluating Citi\u2019s ESG policies and programs.               \n  Citi\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting             \n  are designed to ensure that Citi\u2019s financial                  \n  reporting and its financial statements are                    \n  prepared in accordance with generally accepted                \n  accounting principles. While the Board and its                \n  committees are not responsible for preparing our              \n  financial statements, they have oversight                     \n  responsibility, including the selection of outside            \n  independent auditors, subject to stockholder                  \n  ratification, and lead engagement partner. The                \n  Board must include members with direct or                     \n  supervisory experience in the preparation of                  \n  financial statements, as well as finance, audit,              \n  and accounting expertise.                                     \n  Citi employs approximately 223,400 people in nearly 100       \n  countries. Human capital                                      \n  management is a critical capability for Citi\u2019s Board given    \n  the strategic importance of maintaining a skilled, motivated  \n  workforce. Citi\u2019s Board must include Directors who            \n  understand key issues related to human capital including      \n  training,                                                     \n  diversity, employee benefits, compensation programs, career   \n  trajectories, and U.S. and global labor issues.

Citi seeks out              \n  Board members who have had experience overseeing and          \n  managing executive teams and a sizeable worldwide work        \n  force, with an emphasis                                       \n  on development of human resources.                            \n  Citi provides a wide variety of services to its               \n  corporate clients, including strategic and                    \n  financial advisory services, such as mergers,                 \n  acquisitions, financial restructurings, loans,                \n  foreign exchange, cash management, underwriting               \n  and distributing equity, and debt and equity                  \n  derivative services, markets and securities                   \n  services, retail structured products, liquidity               \n  management, treasury and trade solutions and                  \n  securities and fund services. With a corporate                \n  business as extensive and complex as Citi\u2019s, it is            \n  crucial that members of the Board have the depth              \n  of understanding and experience necessary to guide            \n  management\u2019s conduct of these lines of business.              \n                                                                \nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                         \n  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  51  \n                                         \n                                                      \n  As a company with a broad international reach,      \n  Citi\u2019s Board values the perspectives of Directors   \n  with international business or governmental         \n  experience or expertise in global economics.        \n  Citi\u2019s presence in markets outside the United       \n  States is an important competitive advantage for    \n  Citi, because it allows us to serve U.S. and        \n  foreign businesses and individual clients whose     \n  activities span the globe. Directors with           \n  international business experience can use the       \n  experience that they have developed through their   \n  own business dealings to assist Citi\u2019s Board and    \n  management in understanding and successfully        \n  navigating the business, political, and regulatory  \n  environments in countries in which Citi does or     \n  seeks to do business. Directors with global         \n  economics expertise can help guide Citi management  \n  in understanding the challenges faced by other      \n  markets and in developing its global strategy.      \n  Citi and its subsidiaries are regulated and         \n  supervised by numerous regulatory agencies, both    \n  domestically and internationally, including in the  \n  U.S. the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the   \n  Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit    \n  Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial       \n  Protection Bureau, and state banking and insurance  \n  departments, as well as international financial     \n  services authorities. Having Directors with         \n  experience interacting with regulators or           \n  operating businesses subject to extensive           \n  regulation is important to furthering Citi\u2019s        \n  continued compliance with its many regulatory       \n  requirements and fostering productive               \n  relationships with its regulators. Given the        \n  critical importance of ethics, conduct and          \n  culture, Citi\u2019s Board must include members with     \n  experience overseeing ethics and compliance and     \n  building an effective, values-based ethics and      \n  compliance program. In addition to the regulatory   \n  supervision described above, Citi is subject to     \n  myriad laws and regulations and is party to legal   \n  actions and regulatory proceedings from time to     \n  time. Citi\u2019s Board has an important oversight       \n  function with respect to compliance with            \n  applicable requirements, monitors the progress of   \n  legal proceedings, and evaluates major              \n  settlements.                                        \n  Risk management is a critical function of a         \n  complex global financial services company and its   \n  proper supervision requires Board members with      \n  sophisticated risk management skills and            \n  experience. Directors provide oversight of the      \n  Company\u2019s risk management framework, including the  \n  significant policies, procedures, and practices     \n  used in managing credit, market (trading and        \n  non-trading), liquidity, strategic, operational,    \n  compliance, reputation and certain other risks,     \n  and review recommendations by management regarding  \n  risk mitigation.

Directors\u0092\ncompensation is determined by the Board and the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee makes recommendations to\nthe Board based on periodic benchmarking assessments and advice\nreceived from FW Cook, its independent advisor. In making\nrecommendations to the Board, the Committee considers the\ncompetitive positioning of the aggregate and individual\ncomponents of compensation, as well as the mix of pay and\nstructure versus both direct competitors and other comparable\norganizations. The Committee also considers the unique skill set\nrequired to serve on our Board and the intense time commitment\nassociated with preparation for and attendance at meetings of\nthe Board and its committees as well as external commitments,\nsuch as engagement with our stockholders and regulators. Since\nour initial public offering in 1986, Citi has paid outside\nDirectors all or a portion of their compensation in common stock\nto ensure that the Directors have an ownership interest in\ncommon with other stockholders.\n                                                      \n  Annual Cash Retainer and Deferred Stock Award       \n  Non-employee Directors receive an annual cash       \n  retainer of $75,000 and a deferred stock award      \n  valued at $150,000. The deferred stock award is     \n  generally granted on the same date that annual      \n  incentives are granted to the senior executives.    \n  In the event a Director retires or resigns from     \n  the Board in the year for which an award is         \n  granted before attaining age 72, a pro rata         \n  portion of the award is forfeited, based on the     \n  number of full or partial calendar quarters         \n  served. The deferred stock award generally becomes  \n  distributable on the second anniversary of the      \n  date of the grant, and Directors may elect to       \n  defer receipt of the award beyond that date.        \n                                                      \n                                                                \n  Fees for Service on Citi\u0092s Board Committees,                   \n  Citibank\u0092s Board, and other Board Service                      \n  \u25cfA                                                            \n  Citi Director who serves as Chair of the Audit Committee,     \n  Personnel and Compensation Committee, Risk Management         \n  Committee or certain                                          \n  ad hoc committees is entitled to an annual $50,000 Committee  \n  Chair Fee per committee.

The Board of Directors has determined that all\nseven members of the Committee are independent based upon the\nstandards adopted by the Board, which incorporate the\nindependence requirements under applicable laws, rules and\nregulations. Management is responsible for the financial\nreporting process, the system of internal controls, including\ninternal control over financial reporting, risk management and\nprocedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting\nstandards and applicable laws and regulations. KPMG LLP,\nCitigroup\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm\n(\u201cindependent auditors\u201d) is responsible for the integrated audit\nof the consolidated financial statements and internal control\nover financial reporting. The Committee\u2019s responsibility is to\nmonitor and oversee these processes and procedures. The members\nof the Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice\nof accounting or auditing and are not professionals in these\nfields. The Committee relies, without independent verification,\non the information provided to it and on the representations\nmade by management regarding the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, that the financial statements\nhave been prepared with integrity and objectivity and that such\nfinancial statements have been prepared in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica. The Committee also relies on the opinions of the\nindependent auditors of the consolidated financial statements\nand the effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting. The Committee\u2019s meetings facilitate communication\namong the members of the Committee, management, the internal\nauditors, and Citigroup\u2019s independent auditors. The Committee\nseparately met with each of the internal and independent\nauditors with and without management, to discuss the results of\ntheir examinations and their observations and recommendations\nregarding Citigroup\u2019s internal controls. The Committee discussed\nwith the independent auditors the matters required to be\ndiscussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. The\nCommittee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated\nfinancial statements of Citigroup as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 with management, the internal auditors, and\nCitigroup\u2019s independent auditors. The Committee has received the\nwritten disclosures required by PCAOB Rule 3526, \u201cCommunication\nwith Audit Committees Concerning Independence.\u201d The Committee\ndiscussed with the independent auditors any relationships that\nmay have an impact on their objectivity and independence and\nsatisfied itself as to the auditors\u2019 independence. The Committee\nhas reviewed and approved the amount of fees paid to the\nindependent auditors for audit, audit-related and tax compliance\nand other services. The Committee concluded that the provision\nof services by the independent auditors did not impair their\nindependence. Based on the above-mentioned review and\ndiscussions, and subject to the limitations on our role and\nresponsibilities described above and in the Committee charter,\nthe Committee recommended to the Board that Citigroup\u2019s audited\nconsolidated financial statements be included in Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021\nfor filing with the SEC.

Audit-Related Fees This includes\nfees for services performed by KPMG that are closely related to\naudits and in many cases could only be provided by our\nindependent registered public accounting firm. Such services may\ninclude accounting consultations, internal control reviews not\nrequired by regulators, securitization-related services,\nemployee benefit plan audits, certain attestation services as\nwell as certain agreed upon procedures, and due diligence\nservices related to contemplated mergers and acquisitions. Tax\nFees This includes preparation and review of corporate tax\nreturns, expense allocation reports for tax purposes, and other\ntax compliance services. All Other Fees Citi engaged KPMG for\none service in 2020 and 2021 classified under \u201cAll Other Fees.\u201d\nThe aggregate fee amount of $10,393 is included in the total\namount; however, due to rounding, this fee is not represented in\nthe \u201cAll Other Fees\u201d column. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  70  PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT      \n      REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS                             \n                                                                \nApproval of Independent Registered Public Accountants Services\nand Fees Citi\u2019s Audit Committee has reviewed and approved all\nfees earned in 2020 and 2021 by Citi\u2019s independent registered\npublic accountants and actively monitored the relationship\nbetween audit and non-audit services provided. The Audit\nCommittee has concluded that the fees earned by KPMG were\nconsistent with the maintenance of the external auditors\u2019\nindependence in the conduct of its auditing functions. The Audit\nCommittee must pre-approve all services provided and fees earned\nby Citi\u2019s independent registered public accountants. The Audit\nCommittee annually considers the provision of audit services\nand, if appropriate, pre-approves certain defined audit fees,\naudit-related fees, and tax-compliance fees with specific\ndollar-value limits for each category of service. The Audit\nCommittee also considers on a case-by-case basis specific\nengagements that are not otherwise pre-approved (e.g., internal\ncontrol and certain tax compliance engagements) or that exceed\npre-approved fee amounts. On an interim basis, any proposed\nengagement that does not fit within the definition of a pre-\napproved service may be presented to the Chair of the Audit\nCommittee for approval and to the full Audit Committee at its\nnext regular meeting. The Accounting Firm Engagement Standard is\nthe primary basis upon which management ensures the independence\nof its independent registered public accounting firm.\nAdministration of the Standard is centralized in, and monitored\nby, Citi Senior Financial Management, which reports KPMG\u2019s\nengagements throughout the year to the Audit Committee. The\nStandard also includes limitations on the hiring of KPMG\npartners and other professionals to ensure that Citi satisfies\napplicable auditor independence rules. As in prior years, Citi\nand its Audit Committee have engaged in a review of KPMG in\nconnection with the Audit Committee\u2019s consideration of whether\nto recommend that stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG as\nCiti\u2019s independent auditor for the following year. In that\nreview, the Audit Committee considers both the continued\nindependence of KPMG and whether retaining KPMG is in the best\ninterests of Citi and its stockholders. Citi\u2019s management\nprepares an annual assessment of KPMG for the Audit Committee\nthat includes (i) the results of a management survey of KPMG\u2019s\noverall performance; (ii) an analysis of KPMG\u2019s known legal\nrisks and significant proceedings that may impair KPMG\u2019s ability\nto perform Citi\u2019s annual audit; and (iii) KPMG\u2019s fees and\nservices provided to Citi both on an absolute basis, noting, of\ncourse, that KPMG does not provide any non-audit services, other\nthan those described in the Proxy Statement, to Citi, and\ncompared to services provided by other auditing firms to peer\ninstitutions. In addition, KPMG reviews with the Audit Committee\nits analysis of its independence in accordance with the\nAccounting Firm Engagement Standard and PCAOB Rule 3526. In\nperforming its analysis, the Audit Committee considered the\nlength of time KPMG has been Citi\u2019s independent auditor, the\nbreadth and complexity of Citi\u2019s business and its global\nfootprint and the resulting demands placed on its auditing firm\nin terms of expertise in Citi\u2019s businesses, the quantity and\nquality of staff, and global reach. The Audit Committee\nrecognized the ability of KPMG to provide both the necessary\nexpertise to audit Citi\u2019s business and the matching global\nfootprint to audit Citi worldwide and other factors, including\nthe policies that KPMG follows with respect to rotation of the\nkey audit personnel, so that there is a new partner-in-charge at\nleast every five years. Citi\u2019s Audit Committee oversees the\nprocess for, and ultimately approves, the selection of the\nindependent auditor\u2019s lead engagement partner at the five-year\nmandatory rotation period. At the Audit Committee\u2019s instruction,\nKPMG selects candidates to be considered for the lead engagement\npartner role, who are then interviewed by members of Citi\u2019s\nsenior management. After considering the candidates recommended\nby KPMG, senior management makes a recommendation to the Audit\nCommittee regarding the new lead engagement partner. After\ndiscussing the qualifications of the proposed lead engagement\npartner with the current lead engagement partner and senior\nleadership of KPMG, the members of the Audit Committee,\nindividually and/ or as a group, interview the leading\ncandidate.

They    \n       may be reportable in the Summary Compensation Table for  \n  (3)  2022 or subsequent years. For 2021, Mr. Ybarra\u2019s         \n       compensation reported in column 4 above will be paid as  \n       a Deferred Cash Award, consistent with prior years, for  \n       regulatory reasons. We expect that will change           \n       beginning in 2022, subject to regulatory review.         \n       This table does not include awards made during 2021      \n  (4)  under our long-term performance-based Transformation     \n       bonus program, which is described on pages 73-74.        \n       Mr. Ybarra is employed in our London office and his      \n       compensation is designed to comply with U.K. and E.U.    \n       requirements. Accordingly, his entire incentive award    \n       is deferred, and there is no immediate cash bonus        \n       component. Also, for 2021, his compensation in column 3  \n       above will be paid as a Deferred Cash Award, consistent  \n       with prior years. We expect that will change beginning   \n  (5)  in 2022, subject to regulatory review. Finally, his      \n       compensation in column 1 above consists of a             \n       combination of base salary and a fixed role-based        \n       allowance based on certain guidelines related to the     \n       significance of his role. Each year the Compensation     \n       Committee considers the appropriate split between those  \n       components. His compensation is converted from British   \n       pounds to U.S. dollars at the rate of 1.3806125 dollars  \n       per pound.                                               \n                                                                \nTwo principal considerations shaped the overall perspective of\nthe Compensation Committee concerning 2021 pay decisions. First,\nCiti is in a transitional and transformational period. Ms.\nFraser took over as CEO in 2021 following a thorough succession\nprocess. Our successful CEO succession from within our own\nmanagement ranks facilitated a smooth and effective transition,\nboth in respect of our strategic refresh and implementation of\nour compensation philosophy. Ms. Fraser quickly made a series of\nimportant strategic decisions, including the refresh of our\nconsumer strategy in Asia, Europe and the Middle East, our\nintention to focus our franchise in Mexico on our Institutional\nand Private Bank franchises and our internal restructuring and\nformation of our new Global Wealth Management Team. In addition,\nas we have said previously, the Consent Orders highlighted our\nneed to transform aspects of our risk and control environment\nand culture. Second, the Compensation Committee balanced three\ncritical factors: disappointing stockholder returns for 2021,\nsolid financial results and the need to retain leadership in a\ncompetitive market environment. The combination of the foregoing\npresented the Compensation Committee with some challenging\nchoices, but led to results that the Compensation Committee\nbelieves are consistent with our pay for performance philosophy\nand with the use of our compensation programs to support our\ncompetitive needs while incentivizing prudent risk-taking\nbehaviors. The above table is not intended to be a substitute\nfor the reporting of compensation in accordance with SEC rules\nas shown in the 2021 Summary Compensation Table beginning on\npage 99.

Colleagues at all levels are expected to play an\nactive role in achieving these standards, and senior leaders are\naccountable for driving progress. To incentivize effective\nexecution in connection with the Consent Order programs and to\ndrive change in Citi\u2019s risk and control environment and culture,\nin August 2021 the Compensation Committee approved a long-term\nperformance-based bonus program (the Transformation Bonus\nProgram). Because of its specific focus, and in light of the\ncritical importance of the Transformation Program to our\nstockholders and other stakeholders, the Transformation Bonus\nProgram:\n                                                                \n     contains a different balance of metrics and other design   \n     features than our regular compensation program. In         \n     particular, it does not consider financial performance     \n  \u25cf  metrics in determining payouts, which would dilute the     \n     strong incentive intended to be created. We intend for     \n     this program to provide a simple, clear and strong         \n     message that success is defined by a change in Citi\u2019s      \n     risk and control environment and culture.                  \n     provides for payment only to employees who remain          \n     employed through a specified vesting date, without regard  \n     to the reason for termination of employment. This feature  \n  \u25cf  of the program is designed to provide a similarly simple,  \n     clear and strong message that continued collective         \n     delivery is essential to success in this effort, and       \n     therefore is a payment condition.                          \n     focuses on collective performance against Transformation   \n  \u25cf  Program goals.  The baseline payout percentage will be     \n     generally consistent across                                \n     all participants.                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s compensation philosophy includes the accountability\nsenior leaders at the firm have \u2013 individually and collectively\n\u2013 to meet the milestones required for a successful\nTransformation Program. Under the Transformation Bonus Program,\nsenior leaders will have the opportunity to benefit from the\nachievement of Citi\u2019s Transformation goals. Lack of sufficient\nprogress will negatively affect the compensation of senior\nleaders in various ways, including potential loss of the benefit\nunder the Transformation Bonus Program entirely. As noted above,\nsince the Transformation Bonus Program is specifically designed\nto incentivize change in Citi\u2019s risk and control environment and\nculture, it does not consider financial performance metrics in\ndetermining payouts. However, half of the payout is tied to\nCiti\u2019s stock price over the full multi-year performance period.\nThis feature of the program\u2019s design recognizes the fact that\nthe transformation of our risk and control environment is\nabsolutely a key stockholder interest. This feature aligns the\ninterests of our key employees with the bottom line interest of\nour stockholders. Under the Transformation Bonus Program, our\nnamed executive officers other than Ms. Fraser each have the\nopportunity to earn up to $5 million of additional compensation\nbased on the achievement of Citi\u2019s Transformation goals from\nAugust 2021 through December 2024 and satisfaction of other\nperformance conditions. Actual payouts will reflect the\ncollective performance in respect of Citi\u2019s Transformation goals\nover this performance period, divided into three parts, with\npayment allocated as follows: 25% in February 2023, 25% in\nFebruary 2024 and 50% February 2025. The Transformation Bonus\nProgram also applies to approximately 250 other senior leaders\nwho are critical to helping deliver a successful Transformation.\nThe amount of such participants\u0092 potential bonuses will depend\non their individual compensation levels. The portion of the\ntarget bonus, if any, that the executives earn is tied to the\nfollowing Citi-wide non-financial performance metrics applied as\nappropriate over the entire multi-year performance period:\n                                                                \n  \u25cf  submission of suitable transformation plans to Citi\u2019s      \n     regulators in the U.S.;                                    \n  \u25cf  timely execution of required interim measures;             \n  \u25cf  timely execution of the highest-priority risk-reduction    \n     Transformation Program components; and                     \n  \u25cf  sustainable outcomes in program execution, resourcing,     \n     risk reduction and data governance.                        \n                                                                \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  74  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR 2021 EXECUTIVE   \n      COMPENSATION                                              \n                                                                \nIn addition, demonstrable, quality individual leadership in all\njob specific aspects of the Transformation Program is considered\nas a performance threshold. In other words, the ability to earn\nany payout under this program is predicated on a favorable\nindividual leadership assessment. Earned awards may be less than\nbut not greater than target. The Compensation Committee will\nevaluate performance against these measures, with the baseline\npayout percentage being generally consistent across all\nparticipants. Payment representing 50% of award value will be\nindexed to changes in the value of Citi\u0092s common stock from the\naward date through the payment date. Cancellation and clawback\nis provided for in the event of misconduct and certain other\ncircumstances.\n               \n  Performance  \n               \nThe following summarizes highlights of Company performance in\n2021 in respect of our four performance pillars. Discussion of\nthe performance of each of the named executive officers\nindividually in respect of each pillar is on pages 89-95.\nFinancial The following financial performance highlights were\nconsidered by the Compensation Committee when awarding executive\nincentive pay for 2021. In making compensation determinations,\nour Compensation Committee takes into account additional\nfinancial metrics for each individual named executive officer,\nas described below.\n                    \n  INVESTOR CAPITAL  \n                    \nOur vision for Citi is to be the preeminent bank for\ninstitutions with cross-border needs, a global leader in wealth,\nand a major player in consumer payments and lending in the home\nmarket. We are making management reporting changes to align with\nour vision and strategy, including to assist us in decisions\nabout resources and capital allocation and to assess business\nperformance. In the first quarter of 2022, we will revise our\nfinancial reporting structure to align with these management\nreporting changes to enable investors and others to better\nunderstand the performance and value of our businesses:\n                                                                \n     First, we are creating a Personal Banking and Wealth       \n     Management segment. It will consist of two distinct        \n  \u25cf  reporting\u00a0units: U.S. Personal Banking businesses and a    \n     Global Wealth Management business, which will include the  \n     private\u00a0bank.                                              \n     Second, with respect to our Institutional Clients Group,   \n     we will begin reporting under three reporting units:       \n     Services, Banking and Markets. Services will include       \n  \u25cf  treasury and trade solutions and securities services,      \n     reflecting the importance of these businesses to our       \n     future. These businesses are foundational to Citi given    \n     their global footprint and full suite of product           \n     offerings.                                                 \n     Finally, we are creating Legacy Franchises, a segment      \n     that will consist of all the businesses we intend to       \n     exit, including our remaining legacy Holdings assets. We   \n  \u25cf  have substantial experience in managing businesses that    \n     are being divested and have established a dedicated team   \n     to manage this segment. This will enable the management    \n     teams leading our other segments to focus on executing     \n     Citi\u0092s strategy.                                            \n                                                                \nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                                     \n  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR 2021  75  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                             \n                                                     \nThe following table summarizes Citi\u0092s reporting structure during\n2021 and its new 2022 financial reporting structure: We had\ndisappointing absolute and relative shareholder returns in 2021.\nFor the one-, three- and five-year periods ending with 2021 our\ntotal shareholder returns have been 1.0%, 29.4% and 17.6%,\nrespectively.

We have embarked on a transformation in the way\nwe manage risk in our culture and its impact on controls. Every\nmember of our leadership team is involved in the Transformation\nand plays a key, hands-on role in its implementation. We have\nassembled an extraordinary team of top talent, consisting of\nlong-tenured colleagues and new hires as appropriate, from\nacross multiple differences and areas of expertise and\nexperience, with representatives from the businesses and global\nfunctions, to lead six different Transformation programs. We are\nputting our best talent into this effort and have a detailed,\nintegrated approach to address the needs of our clients,\ninvestors and regulators. A principal objective for 2021 was to\nbuild an organization and infrastructure to manage, guide and\nsupport our Transformation. The organizational structure would\nneed to span all Citi businesses and functions to ensure\nconsistency. We believe that we have implemented a structure\nthat provides the tools to achieve that objective, through our\nChief Administrative Officer and her team as well as various\nglobal forums and committees. We hold our leadership team\naccountable for their individual performance in executing\nagainst these priorities. To further enhance this\naccountability, we adopted our long-term performance-based\nTransformation Bonus Program discussed on pages 73-74. Under the\nTransformation Bonus Program, there are firmwide performance\nassessments that apply to approximately 250 participants,\nensuring that the leadership team and management have strong\nresponsibilities to each other as well as to other stakeholders,\nincluding investors and regulators.

This process commenced in 2019 with Ms.\nFraser's elevation to President of Citi, and subsequent\npromotion effective February 26, 2021, to Chief Executive\nOfficer, and illustrates the successful management of the\nsuccession process by Mr. Corbat, the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee and the entire Board.\n                     \n  STRATEGIC REFRESH  \n                     \nOur selection of Ms. Fraser as the best person to lead our\norganization, following a thorough succession process, ensured a\nsmooth and effective transition of leadership. This seamless and\ncarefully planned transition enabled Citi to get off to a strong\nstart on our key strategic objectives. As noted above, in April\n2021, we announced that we will focus our consumer banking\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA on four wealth centers and as a\nresult pursue exits of our consumer franchises in the remaining\n13 markets across the two regions. More recently, we announced\nour intention to exit the consumer, small business and middle\nmarket banking operations of Citibanamex. We also announced in\n2021 an internal restructuring and formation of our new Global\nWealth Management Team, and consistent with those changes we\nrecently announced the creation of two new operating segments -\nPersonal Banking and Wealth Management, and Legacy Franchises -\nin addition to our Institutional Clients Group segment. Client\nand Franchise The success of our client and franchise efforts\ndepends on a long-term, firmwide approach, and we engaged in\nmany separate projects in 2021, both large and small, in support\nof our goals. Last year in this space we described our actions\nto address enabling growth and economic progress in the midst of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and our Action for Racial Equity efforts.\nThis year, we highlight three other programs that were\nconsidered by the Compensation Committee as important examples\nof our efforts to solidify client relationships and strengthen\nour franchise during 2021.\n                                       \n  COMMUNITY INVESTING AND DEVELOPMENT  \n                                       \nCiti Community Investing and Development (CID) is an integrated\nteam that works across Citi\u0092s businesses and functions to\ncatalyze positive social impact in communities around the world.\nCID comprises the following teams:\n                                                                \n     Citi Impact Fund: Invests in \u0093double bottom line\u0094 U.S.       \n     companies that are addressing societal challenges,         \n  \u25cf  including\u00a0workforce development, sustainability,           \n     infrastructure, financial capability and access to         \n     capital and economic opportunity                           \n     Citi Social Finance: Works across Citi businesses          \n     globally to catalyze scalable business platforms and       \n     client solutions                                           \n  \u25cf  that enable the bank, our clients and our partners to      \n     expand financial inclusion, accelerate access to basic     \n     services, boost job creation and scale social              \n     infrastructure development                                 \n     U.S. Business Partnerships: Leads Citi\u0092s relationships      \n     with national civil rights and consumer protection         \n     organizations to gain insights into issues affecting low-  \n  \u25cf  and                                                        \n     moderate-income communities and communities of color, and  \n     catalyze product and service innovations that help expand  \n     financial access and close the                             \n     racial wealth gap                                          \n     U.S. Community Relations: Catalyzes social impact by       \n     engaging                                                   \n     and partnering with local community                        \n     leaders and organizations across the                       \n  \u25cf  country.

Citi\u2019s investment in and support of local communities is\ncore to our mission to enable growth and economic progress. We\nare the largest affordable housing development lender in the\nU.S., providing $7 billion in loans for affordable housing\nprojects last year. The OCC assessed Citi\u2019s performance in\nhelping to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income\n(LMI) individuals, as well as delivering products and services\nin LMI communities where we operate. Citi\u2019s lending,\ninvestments, and services from 2017 to 2019 were analyzed for\ntheir responsiveness and impact on the community\u2019s needs. The\nCRA requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the\ncommunities in which they are chartered, including LMI\nneighborhoods. For the evaluation period, Citibank allocated\nover $125.6 billion in CRA activities. Of this amount, Citibank\ntargeted the needs of its CRA assessment areas through\napproximately:\n                                                                \n  \u25cf  135,000 mortgages and 599,000 small business loans         \n     totaling $68.4 billion                                     \n  \u25cf  $12.3 billion in community development lending to helping  \n     LMI communities                                            \n  \u25cf  $7.6 billion in community development investments and an   \n     additional $147.6 million in grants and donations          \n     13,000 staff hours to non-profit organizations that        \n     provide services targeted to LMI individuals and           \n  \u25cf  communities, with focus on financial education, technical  \n     assistance for small businesses, and first-time homebuyer  \n     education                                                  \n     Growing its proprietary Access Account, which offers       \n  \u25cf  Citibank\u2019s digital capabilities with low or avoidable      \n     monthly charges and no overdraft fees, to represent 20     \n     percent of all accounts in the U.S.                        \n                                                                \n                       \n  SUSTAINABLE FINANCE  \n                       \nIn April 2021, we announced our $1 trillion commitment to\nsustainable finance by 2030, following the 2020 announcement of\nour new five-year, 2025 Sustainable Progress Strategy to help\naccelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. This\ncommitment aligns with the ambitious agenda of the United\nNations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and builds on the\nwork we outlined in our 2025 Sustainable Progress Strategy.\nCrucially, this $1 trillion includes extending our current\nenvironmental finance target from $250 billion by 2025 to $500\nbillion by 2030. We will finance and facilitate a wide array of\nclimate solutions \u2014 from renewable energy and clean technology,\nto water conservation and sustainable transportation \u2014 and will\nfurther accelerate the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon\neconomy that balances the environmental, social and economic\nneeds of society.

These include important\ninvestments in education, affordable housing, health care,\neconomic inclusion, community finance, international development\nfinance, racial and ethnic diversity and gender equality. We are\ncommitting an additional $500 billion to these activities by\n2030, as part of our $1 trillion sustainable finance effort.\nGiven our global footprint and our activities supporting\neconomic activity around the world, Citi has a role to play in\nachieving the SDGs. As the pandemic made clear, our economic and\nphysical health, our environment and our social stability are\nall inextricably linked. At Citi, our response is similarly\nmulti-pronged and interconnected, and our commitment to\nsustainable finance is an important part of our contribution.\nWhile there is still much to do and the challenges are immense,\nour goals are both ambitious and urgent and our commitment to\ncollective action \u2014 with governments, clients and competitors \u2014\nis strong.\n                            \n  ACTION FOR RACIAL EQUITY  \n                            \nEffectively responding to the needs of communities of color\nrepresents a strategic imperative for the private sector. As\nshifting population demographics lead to growth in these\ncommunities, their purchasing and saving power should grow as\nwell, expanding opportunities for companies both in talent\nacquisition and product marketing. In addition, with wealth\nshifting to the next generation and many young people making\nfinancial decisions based on alignment with their values,\ncompanies are increasingly expected to play a role in addressing\nsocietal issues, with economic inequality and social injustice,\nincluding issues of racial equity, high among the list. In\nSeptember 2020, Citi and the Citi Foundation announced Action\nfor Racial Equity (ARE), during a time of increased calls for\nracial equity, made more pressing by a global pandemic that\ndisproportionately affected communities of color. ARE aims to\nhelp close the racial wealth gap in the U.S. primarily through\nCiti\u2019s core business products and services across four key areas\nof activity: providing greater access to banking and credit in\ncommunities of color, increasing investment in Black-owned\nbusinesses, expanding affordable housing and homeownership among\nBlack Americans, and advancing anti-racist practices in our\ncompany and the financial services industry. More than a year\ninto our three-year pledge, we have already invested $1 billion\ninto initiatives expanding economic opportunity for communities\nof color, putting us on track to far exceed our original $1.1\nbillion commitment set in 2020. That includes providing growth\nequity and extending invitations to Minority Depository\nInstitutions to participate in revenue generation opportunities\nalongside Citi, investing venture capital in Black-founded\ncompanies through the Citi Impact Fund, and committing equity to\nBlack real estate developers to preserve affordable and\nworkforce housing. We have engaged across our firm to think and\nact in support of equity. Throughout 2021, we worked on one of\nour key measures of success \u2014 institutionalizing the commitment\nto racial equity across the firm. For example, we have started\nto develop a centralized Financial Inclusion and Racial Equity\nSegment Team within U.S. Personal Banking to develop targeted\nand integrated segment strategies, drive seamless customer-\ncentric execution, and champion greater financial inclusion,\nracial equity, and customer protection within the U.S. We have\nalso created a Diverse Financial Institutions Group, which will\nserve as a hub to lead and expand firmwide engagement with\nMinority Depository Institutions, Diverse Broker Dealers and\nDiverse Asset Managers. We view ARE as a critical step in our\nracial equity journey, and we continue to work to evolve our\napproach. In 2021, Citi committed to conduct a third-party\nracial equity audit of ARE. Conducting this audit will not only\nhelp assess the impact of our current efforts, but also help\ninform how to adapt and grow our work going forward.\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  80  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE\u00a0OUR 2021 EXECUTIVE   \n      COMPENSATION                                              \n                                                                \n                            \n  Philosophy and Framework  \n                            \nOur Compensation Philosophy is designed to encourage prudent\nrisk-taking and management of controls while attracting the\nworld-class talent necessary to our success. Our Compensation\nPhilosophy is summarized by the following five objectives:\n                                                                \n  \u25cf  Reinforce a business culture based on the highest ethical  \n     standards                                                  \n  \u25cf  Manage our risks by encouraging prudent decision-making    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u25cf  Reflect regulatory guidance in compensation programs       \n  \u25cf  Attract and retain the best talent to lead us to success   \n  \u25cf  Align compensation programs, structures, and decisions     \n     with stockholder and other stakeholder interests           \n                                                                \nThe full statement of our Compensation Philosophy is available\non our public website. Consistent with our Compensation\nPhilosophy, we design our executive pay program to motivate\nbalanced behaviors. The compensation of our executive officers\nis determined based on a disciplined policy of goal setting and\nmeasurement and assessment of performance against pre-\nestablished goals. Transparency, discipline and performance\nfeedback are key factors in our approach to executive officer\ncompensation. Implementation of the process spans the full year.\nElements of Annual Compensation The total incentive awarded to\nexecutive officers is delivered in three parts: (a) annual cash\nbonus, (b) deferred stock awards, the value of which depends on\nour stock price, and (c) performance share units (PSUs), the\nvalue of which, if any, depends on our stock price and\nachievement of performance goals, except as required by\nregulatory requirements in the U.K. as described herein. Our\nincentive awards foster a balance between annual and long-term\ncomponents, with the majority of incentive compensation\ndelivered in awards that pay out over multiple years. 71% of the\nlong-term incentives delivered to our CEO, and 50% of the long-\nterm incentives delivered to our other named executive officers,\nare subject to performance-based vesting criteria. In\ndetermining the percentages to grant of each award type, the\nCompensation Committee considered applicable regulatory\nrequirements and guidelines for deferral as well as market\npractices.

officers. Set forth on pages 86-88 is a detailed\ndescription of how we take risk into account in our compensation\nprocess and award features.\n                          \n  PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT  \n                          \nWe adopted CART, our compensation accountability and rationale\ntool, in 2020 as a means for administering our new compensation\nprinciples and practices. CART is an integral part of our\ncompensation framework. CART is a process tool that resulted in\nsignificantly increased transparency, discipline and\nthoughtfulness with respect to the impact of risk and control\nperformance on compensation decisions. While CART requires a\nnotably disciplined approach to year-end performance assessment,\nits most important feature is that it requires managers to\nprovide a detailed explanation of performance across each of the\nfour CART pillars \u2014 Risk and Control, Financial, Client and\nFranchise, and Leadership \u2014 to support compensation decisions.\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  82  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR 2021 EXECUTIVE   \n      COMPENSATION                                              \n                                                                \nCART creates a comprehensive record evidencing how risk was\nconsidered in compensation decisions. This practice enables us\nto systematically hold each senior manager accountable in a\ndisciplined way for management of risk and control and for\ndetermining compensation. Each named executive officer\u2019s total\nincentive award is based on our overall achievements, individual\nexecutive performance against applicable goals and a market\nbenchmarking process. Metrics and goals for each named executive\nofficer\u2019s total incentive award are contained in the executive\u2019s\nscorecard. A market benchmarking process, with market rates of\npay adjusted to reflect each named executive officer\u2019s\nexperience and the scope of his or her role is the starting\npoint. In addition, written narrative assessments for each of\nthe four CART pillars are completed for each named executive\nofficer. The Compensation Committee completes this assessment\nfor our CEO and contributes to the assessments for our other\nexecutive officers. These factors, considered together, form the\nbasis for the Compensation Committee\u2019s determination of\nincentive compensation amounts. Under our compensation\nframework, our Compensation Committee uses a five-step process\nwhen making final determinations regarding named executive\nofficer incentive compensation. The steps are illustrated in the\nfollowing graphic and summarized immediately below the graphic.\n                                                                \n     Step 1 \u2013 Goal                                              \n     Setting for                                                \n     Scorecards                                                 \n                         The Compensation                       \n                         Committee sets                         \n                         scorecard goals                        \n                         for each named                         \n                         executive officer                      \n                         early in the                           \n                         annual                                 \n                         compensation                           \n                         cycle.

Accordingly, an\nimportant step in our executive compensation framework is the\nCompensation Committee\u2019s analysis of market pay, which is based\non surveys of peer firm compensation for each named executive\nofficer role. The Compensation Committee, with input from its\nindependent compensation consultant, established the\ncompensation peer group we currently use to determine market pay\nranges. The Compensation Committee evaluates the compensation\npeer group on an annual basis to ensure that the group continues\nto be appropriate. The Compensation Committee continues to\nbelieve that a U.S.-based peer group reflects the relevant\nmarket for executive talent and the relevant regulatory\nenvironment for our executive compensation. We chose the peers\nbecause they operate in one or more lines of business that are\nsimilar to ours and compete in similar labor markets, although\nmost do not have global scale or size comparable to ours. In\nselecting the compensation peer group, the Compensation\nCommittee uses size-based metrics as primary screening criteria\namong financial services firms.\n                                                                \n                      2021 COMPENSATION                         \n                      PEER GROUP                                \n  AIG (AIG)           Goldman Sachs (GS)    Prudential (PRU)    \n  American Express    JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  \n  (AXP)                                                         \n  Bank of America     MetLife (MET)         Wells Fargo (WFC)   \n  (BAC)                                                         \n  BNY Mellon (BK)     Morgan Stanley (MS)                       \n  Capital One (COF)   PNC (PNC)                                 \n                                                                \nIn evaluating the market for named executive officer\ncompensation, the Compensation Committee focuses primarily on\ncompensation for comparable roles at the U.S.-based global banks\nwith lines of business and scale similar to ours: Bank of\nAmerica, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and\nWells Fargo.

The feedback we received on our    \n     executive pay program was broadly favorable, reflecting    \n     the numerous changes made in previous years in direct      \n     response to stockholder comments. Noting no concerns that  \n     merited discussion, investors representing approximately   \n     1.3% of our outstanding shares declined our invitation to  \n     participate in the Spring 2021 engagement effort. In       \n     addition, notwithstanding our request for engagement,      \n     investors representing about 2.2% of our outstanding       \n     shares did not respond to our request.                     \n     Fall 2021 through Winter 2022:\u00a0In the Fall of 2021 and     \n     into early 2022, we conducted a second round of            \n     engagement with stockholders representing about 24.23% of  \n     our outstanding shares in a series of meetings that        \n     focused on sustainability issues, including climate        \n  \u25cf  change and Citi\u2019s net zero plan, human capital management  \n     and corporate governance. In the area of human capital     \n     management, the topics included our racial equity audit,   \n     diverse representation in senior roles at Citi, talent     \n     development and succession planning, our response to the   \n     COVID-19 pandemic and gender pay equity.                   \n                                                                \nAll the material features of our executive compensation program\nare designed to be aligned with stockholder interests and in\nmost cases are directly responsive to stockholder feedback we\nhave received during engagement as outlined above and in\nprevious years, including the following:\n                                                                \n     Extensive disclosure of pay rationales.

We adjust the amount of compensation upwards to\nrecognize exemplary behaviors and downwards to disincentivize\nemployees from taking inappropriate risks. Our incentive\ncompensation awards have the following important elements:\n                                                                \n     Our executive compensation framework takes risk and        \n  \u25cf  control management into account in several ways,           \n     including:                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u25cf  using financial metrics that reflect risk as an element    \n     of each executive\u2019s financial goals                        \n     evaluating risk management performance, including          \n  \u25cf  effectiveness of the control environment, as part of the   \n     performance assessment                                     \n  \u25cf  providing for forfeiture of the deferred portion of        \n     incentive awards based on adverse risk outcomes            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     We systematically identify employees who, individually or  \n     as part of a group, have authorities or responsibilities   \n     that may subject the firm to material risks. Through a     \n     systematic annual process, we identify the material risks  \n     to the firm and then identify employees with influence     \n  \u25cf  over those risks. We refer to those employees as \u201ccovered  \n     employees.\u201d The compensation structure for covered         \n     employees, including the named executive officers,         \n     includes substantial deferrals and clawbacks intended to   \n     cover a range of behaviors. The portion of incentive       \n     awards that are subject to deferral increases with the     \n     size of incentive awards.                                  \n     Our executive compensation governance process ensures      \n     that risk and control performance is taken into account    \n     in evaluating performance for covered employees. Under     \n  \u25cf  our process, covered employees can receive adjustments to  \n     their incentive awards in amounts ranging from negative    \n     100% to positive 25% of total compensation to reflect      \n     their performance assessment for the Risk and Control      \n     pillar.                                                    \n     Regulatory matters are reflected in performance            \n     assessments for covered employees and regulatory-related   \n  \u25cf  goals are cascaded to other employee performance           \n     evaluations as appropriate to the applicable roles         \n     throughout Citi.                                           \n     Our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Compliance Officer        \n     report at least twice annually to the Compensation         \n  \u25cf  Committee on risk levels and trends across our businesses  \n     and on the design and operation of our incentive           \n     compensation program.                                      \n                                                                \n                                                   \n  2021 CHANGES TO OUR COMPENSATION AND SUCCESSION  \n  PROCESSES                                        \n                                                   \nDuring 2021 we adopted a new Risk and Control Behavior\nAssessment (RCA) process for assessing performance for\napproximately 450 senior managers across our businesses and\nfunctions with significant risk and control responsibility.\nThese assessments are central to ratings for those employees in\nour Risk and Control pillar. Under the new process, assessments\nare determined by the rating of their independent risk and\ncontrol function colleagues in Risk, Internal Audit, Compliance\nand Legal. We ensured that Risk and Control pillar ratings were\nconsistent with the RCA process and the other internal\nindependent performance inputs, and calibrated the ratings\nacross businesses, business units, and regions. Of the employees\nincluded in the RCA process in 2021, approximately 37% received\na positive impact to compensation as a result of their work to\nbuild a stronger risk and control environment, while\napproximately 15% received a negative impact for unsatisfactory\nrisk and control behavior and for the rest compensation was not\nimpacted. In addition, during 2021 we included a Risk and\nControl evaluation as a key component to assess candidates as\nsuccessors for our top leadership roles.

FW Cook provides no services to\nus other than its services to the Board, has no other ties to\nmanagement that could jeopardize its fully independent status,\nand has strong internal governance policies that help ensure it\nmaintains its independence. Representatives of FW Cook attended\nall Compensation Committee meetings during 2021, including\nexecutive sessions as requested, and engaged with Compensation\nCommittee members between meetings. FW Cook advised the\nCompensation Committee regarding the compensation awarded to the\nCEO and other executive officers. FW Cook also provided\nextensive guidance and analysis regarding the Compensation\nCommittee\u2019s and the Board\u2019s responses to our advisory say-on-pay\nvotes, offered market insights, and provided advice to the\nCompensation Committee on our executive compensation plan design\nand the presentation of our programs to stockholders through the\ninvestor outreach process described earlier as well as required\nSEC disclosures. FW Cook also provides advice to the Board on\nnon-executive director compensation. Pursuant to SEC and NYSE\nrules, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of\nFW Cook most recently in January 2022 and determined that FW\nCook is independent from our management and that its work for\nthe Compensation Committee has not raised any conflicts of\ninterest. TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION Section\n162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to deduct\ncompensation paid to our named executive officers for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, generally to $1 million per year.\nFurther, once any of our employees is considered a \u201ccovered\nemployee\u201d under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code,\nthat person will remain a \u201ccovered employee\u201d so long as the\nperson receives compensation from Citi. The Personnel and\nCompensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has\nevaluated the performance of and determined the compensation for\nthe CEO, approved the compensation of executive officers, and\napproved the compensation structure for other members of senior\nmanagement and other highly compensated employees. The\nCompensation Committee reviewed and discussed the foregoing\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis with members of senior\nmanagement and, based on this review, the Compensation Committee\nrecommended to the Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. that the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed\nwith the SEC.

Deferred   \n       Cash Awards are granted to executives (1) who are not    \n       eligible for Performance Share Units, which are awarded  \n       only to the CEO and executives who report directly to    \n       her or (2) whose compensation is designed to comply      \n       with U.K. and E.U. regulatory guidance, such as Mr.      \n       Ybarra. Generally, these awards vest in equal portions   \n       over four years and are credited with notional interest  \n       at market rates, subject to regulatory requirements. In  \n       addition, Ms. Fraser was granted a special deferred      \n       incentive award in 2019, which is included in the        \n       amount shown for her in this column. The amounts shown   \n  (4)  in this column for 2021 include the following notional   \n       interest amounts: Mr. Mason, $47,292; Mr. Ybarra,        \n       $40,595; Mr. Babej, $47,562; and Mr. Torres Cant\u00fa,       \n       $18,721. No notional interest is paid in connection      \n       with Ms. Fraser\u2019s special award. Mr. Ybarra\u2019s Deferred   \n       Cash Awards are denominated in British pounds because    \n       they relate to his service in London. They are shown as  \n       converted from British pounds to U.S. dollars at the     \n       December 31, 2021, conversion rate used to prepare       \n       Citi\u2019s financial statements (1 British pound = 1.35445   \n       U.S. dollars). Mr. Torres Cant\u00fa\u2019s Deferred Cash Awards   \n       are denominated in Mexican pesos because they related    \n       to his service in Mexico. They are shown as converted    \n       from Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars at the December 31,   \n       2021, conversion rate used to prepare Citi\u2019s financial   \n       statements (1 Mexican peso = 0.04876265 U.S. dollars).   \n       These amounts represent the increases in the present     \n       value of pension benefits for Mr. Mason, Mr. Ybarra,     \n       and Mr. Corbat, as more fully described in the 2021      \n       Pension Benefits Table. The value of Mr. Ybarra\u2019s        \n       benefit under Citibank HOG Plan decreased by ($15,274).  \n  (5)  The decreases in value of Mr. Ybarra\u2019s pension benefits  \n       were primarily attributable to increases in the          \n       discount rate assumptions applicable to the plan.

Citi\nhas not granted extra years of credited service under any\nretirement plan to any of the named executive officers. Ms.\nFraser and Messrs. Babej and Torres Cant\u00fa have never been\neligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan under\nthe terms of Citi\u2019s broad-based retirement programs in effect in\ntheir employment countries; they have participated only in\ndefined contribution retirement plans since the commencement of\ntheir employment at Citi. The following describes the pension\nplans listed in the 2021 Pension Benefits Table. The Citigroup\nPension Plan. The purpose of this broad-based, tax-qualified\nretirement plan is to provide retirement income on a tax-\ndeferred basis to all eligible U.S. employees. Effective\nDecember 31, 2006, The Citigroup Pension Plan was closed to new\nmembers and generally ceased benefit accruals effective December\n31, 2007. Mr. Corbat and Mr. Mason are eligible for benefits\nunder this plan. Their entire benefits are cash balance\nbenefits. The Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance benefit is\nexpressed as a hypothetical account balance. Prior to January 1,\n2008, the plan generally provided for the annual accrual of\nbenefit credits for most of the covered population, including\nthe covered named executive officers, at a rate between 1.5% and\n6% of eligible compensation; the benefit credit rate increased\nwith age and service. Eligible compensation generally included\nbase salary and incentive awards, but excluded compensation\npayable after termination of employment, certain non-recurring\npayments, and other benefits. Annual eligible compensation was\nlimited by the Internal Revenue Code to $225,000 for 2007 (the\nfinal year of cash balance benefit accrual). Interest credits\ncontinue to be applied annually to each participant\u2019s account\nbalance; these credits are based on the yield on 30-year\nTreasury bonds (as published by the Internal Revenue Service).\nBenefits under The Citigroup Pension Plan are payable in annuity\nform or in other optional forms, including a lump sum, upon\ntermination of employment. The Citigroup Pension Plan\u2019s normal\nretirement age is 65. The portion of an eligible participant\u2019s\nbenefit determined under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula\nmay be paid upon early retirement, which is defined for this\npurpose as the first day of the month after the later of the\nparticipant\u2019s 55th birthday or the date on which the participant\ncompletes a year of service (as defined in the plan). The\nRetirement Plan for Specified Non-United States International\nStaff of Citibank, N.A. and Participating Companies\n(International Staff Plan). The International Staff Plan is an\nunfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that was\noffered to a select group of management or highly compensated\nemployees. The International Staff Plan provided a retirement\nbenefit to internationally mobile staff participating in the\nCiti Expatriate Program who, due to their mobile status, were\nineligible for any other Citi defined benefit retirement plan.\nBenefits mirrored the Citibank Retirement Plan and, after 1999,\nThe Citigroup Pension Plan. The International Staff Plan closed\nto new members and generally ceased benefit accruals effective\nDecember 31, 2007, like The Citigroup Pension Plan.

From 1994 through 1999, Mr. Ybarra\naccrued an International Staff Plan benefit determined using the\nCitibank Retirement Plan formula described above, and from 2000\nthrough 2007, Mr. Ybarra accrued an International Staff Plan\nbenefit determined using The Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance\nbenefit formula previously described. Limits on eligible\ncompensation and benefits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code\non tax-qualified retirement plans generally did not apply to\nInternational Staff Plan benefit accruals because the\nInternational Staff Plan is nonqualified; however, the\nInternational Staff Plan was amended over time to include\ncertain limits. Effective January 1, 2000, eligible compensation\nunder the International Staff Plan was limited to $500,000, and\neffective January 1, 2002, the limit on eligible compensation\nimposed by the Internal Revenue Code applied to International\nStaff Plan benefit accruals. Mr. Ybarra is eligible for early\nretirement under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula, meaning\nthat he is eligible for a benefit, actuarially reduced for early\ncommencement, under the International Staff Plan commencing upon\nhis termination of employment. He is eligible for an unreduced\nbenefit commencing immediately if he terminates employment after\nattaining age 60, or, if he terminates employment before age 60,\nhe is eligible for an unreduced benefit commencing at age 65.\nThe International Staff Plan offered lump sum and life annuity\ndistribution options to participants. Payments upon Termination\nor Change of Control General Policies. Citi does not provide\nguaranteed executive severance or change of control agreements.\nPotential Payments Table. Set forth below is a table showing the\nestimated value of outstanding awards that would have been\ndelivered over time to each named executive officer employed by\nCiti on December 31, 2021, had the applicable employment\ntermination or other event occurred on December 31, 2021 and\nassuming that all award vesting and performance conditions are\nsatisfied. Unless the awards are forfeited, the awards shown in\nthe Potential Payments Table vest on schedule following\ntermination of employment and do not accelerate by their terms\nexcept in the case of death.

Deferred Stock Awards granted\nto the named executive officers under the 2019 Stock Incentive\nPlan and predecessor plans vest over a period of four or five\nyears subject to performance conditions. Deferred Stock Awards\nprovide for accelerated vesting if a participant dies but\nprovide for vesting on schedule in all other circumstances in\nwhich vesting occurs after termination of employment. If a\nparticipant\u2019s combined years of age and service meet the Rule of\n60 at the time he or she voluntarily resigns, the participant\u2019s\nDeferred Stock Awards will continue to vest on schedule over the\nvesting period, provided he or she does not work for a\n\u201csignificant competitor\u201d during the vesting period. A\nparticipant meets the Rule of 60 if his or her age plus full\nyears of service equals at least 60 and he or she either: (i) is\nat least age 50 with at least five full years of service; or\n(ii) is under age 50 with at least 20 full years of service.\nPartial years of age and service are each rounded down to the\nnearest whole number. In contrast, if a participant does not\nmeet the Rule of 60 and voluntarily resigns, any unvested\nDeferred Stock Awards are forfeited, unless the participant\nbecomes employed in an \u201calternative career.\u201d Under the\n\u201calternative career\u201d provisions of Citi\u2019s Deferred Stock Awards,\nemployees may continue to vest in their deferred awards if they\nresign from Citi to work full-time in government or at a\ncharitable organization or to teach full-time at an educational\ninstitution. All of the named executive officers had attained\nthe Rule of 60 before December 31, 2021, so none of them are\neligible for the \u201calternative career\u201d provisions, and each of\nthem would be eligible for continued vesting following\nresignation without regard to whether they pursued an\n\u201calternative career.\u201d Performance Share Units. Performance Share\nUnits have the same vesting provisions covering termination of\nemployment as those applicable to Citi\u2019s Deferred Stock Awards,\nincluding the Rule of 60. Any named executive officer who meets\nthe Rule of 60 will receive his or her earned Performance Share\nUnits unless: (i) he or she voluntarily resigns during the\nperformance period and performs services for a competitor, or\n(ii) he or she is terminated for gross misconduct (in which case\nthe undelivered award is canceled). If a named executive officer\nwho meets the Rule of 60 resigns and competes, at the end of the\nperformance period, he or she will forfeit a prorated\nPerformance Share Unit award, based on his or her service during\nthe performance period. For example, if such a named executive\nofficer resigns after the first year of the performance period\nto work for a competitor, he or she will receive one-third of\nthe earned Performance Share Units after the end of the three-\nyear performance period and the other two-thirds will be\nforfeited.

Deferred Cash Awards have the same vesting\nprovisions covering termination of employment as those\napplicable to Citi\u2019s Deferred Stock Awards, including the Rule\nof 60. \u201cDouble Trigger\u201d Change of Control Requirement. Citi\u2019s\n2019 Stock Incentive Plan and its predecessor, the 2014 Stock\nIncentive Plan, have a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d requirement, which\nprovides that an involuntary termination of employment not for\ngross misconduct must occur as a result of a \u201cchange of control\u201d\nof Citi before any vesting of equity awards may occur in\nconnection with the change of control. In addition, the\nCompensation Committee has a policy that equity awards granted\nto executive officers will not be accelerated solely by reason\nof a change of control of Citigroup Inc. The intent of the\npolicy is for such a change of control to have no impact on the\napplicable awards, absent a qualifying termination of\nemployment. The same change of control provisions apply to\nCiti\u2019s Performance Share Units and Deferred Cash Awards. Under\nthe 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, a \u201cchange of control\u201d means: (i)\na person acquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership of\nCitigroup Inc. securities representing 30% or more of the\ncombined voting power of then outstanding securities of\nCitigroup Inc.; (ii) specified changes in the majority of the\nBoard (not including the election of Directors whose election or\nnomination was approved by a majority of the then incumbent\nBoard); (iii) a sale, transfer, or distribution of all or\nsubstantially all of the assets of Citigroup Inc. or a\ndissolution or liquidation of Citigroup Inc.; or (iv)\nconsummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or\nother corporate transaction that results in stockholders of\nCitigroup Inc. not owning more than 50% of the combined voting\npower of Citigroup Inc. or other corporation resulting from the\ntransaction. The 2014 Stock Incentive Plan had the same\nprovision. Management Analysis of Potential Adverse Effects of\nCompensation Plans Citi has adopted multiple coordinated\nstrategies to manage the risk of material adverse effects to the\nfranchise through the design and administration of its incentive\ncompensation programs, including those applicable to the named\nexecutive officers. Those strategies, including regular analyses\nand reviews by Citi\u2019s Chief Risk Officer, are detailed on pages\n81-88. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, management has\nconcluded that Citi\u2019s compensation plans are not reasonably\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on Citi.

We chose this CACM because these two pay    \n        elements were consistently available across all         \n        countries in which we have employees.                   \n        Where full year information from our formulaic          \n     \u27a2  incentive compensation plans was not available, we      \n        estimated such amounts using third quarter payments as  \n        a proxy for fourth quarter payments.                    \n     \u27a2  Compensation paid in foreign currency was converted to  \n        U.S. dollars using a monthly average.                   \n        We did not consider discretionary cash incentives,      \n        equity awards, or deferred cash awards as part of the   \n        analysis because all employees eligible for             \n     \u27a2  discretionary incentives, equity awards, or deferred    \n        cash awards are paid well above our midpoint, and       \n        therefore, including or excluding such compensation     \n        would not affect our midpoint.                          \n        We then calculated the 2021 \u201cannual total               \n        compensation\u201d for a group of representative employees   \n        with compensation at or very near our 2020 midpoint     \n  \u25cf     (our \u201cmidpoint group\u201d). We used the 2021 annual total   \n        compensation of the employee with 2020 annual total     \n        compensation at approximately the median of our         \n        midpoint group to determine our CEO pay ratio.          \n        In determining the \u201cannual total compensation\u201d for      \n        each employee in our midpoint group, we followed the    \n        methodology required under SEC regulations for          \n        calculating the total compensation of our named         \n     \u27a2  executive officers as reported in the Summary           \n        Compensation Table and added the value of employer      \n        contributions to broad-based employee benefit plans     \n        not already included in the Summary Compensation        \n        Table.                                                  \n        The SEC rules for identifying the median-paid employee  \n        and calculating the CEO pay ratio allow companies to    \n  \u25cf     apply various methodologies and assumptions and, as a   \n        result, the CEO pay ratio reported by Citi may not be   \n        comparable to the CEO pay ratio reported by other       \n        companies.                                              \n                                                                \nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n       \n  109  \n       \nProposal 4: Approval of Additional Shares for the Citigroup 2019\nStock Incentive Plan On the recommendation of the Compensation\nCommittee, the Board has unanimously approved an amendment to\nthe Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan).

The initial authorization\nwas estimated to be approximately equal to the shares that would\nno longer be available for grant upon the expiration of the 2014\nStock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan); no additional shares were\nrequested at our 2019 Annual Meeting. The initial share\nauthorization under the 2019 Plan was intended to support grant\nactivity for at least one year. At the 2020 Annual Meeting, we\nrequested and received approval for an additional 15 million\nshares and at the 2021 meeting we requested and received\napproval for an additional 20 million shares, in each case which\nwas intended to support grant activity for one year. Our current\nshare request is consistent with our approach on share\nauthorizations, which is to request increases as often as\nannually but only as needed to support grant activities for at\nleast one year. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                                                                \n  110  Proposal 4: Approval of Additional Shares for the        \n       Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan                      \n                                                                \nOur Equity Award Practices Are Aligned with Stockholder\nInterests\n                                                                \n        Equity compensation aligns employee and stockholder     \n        interests. Citi\u2019s equity awards are a key component of  \n        annual incentive awards for thousands of employees      \n        worldwide, thereby aligning the interests of            \n  \u25cf     stockholders and a broader group of Citi employees      \n        (not just senior executives). In 2022, approximately    \n        9,975 employees in 88 countries received equity awards  \n        under the 2019 Plan as part of our annual bonus         \n        program.                                                \n  \u25cf     Citi has prudent equity award practices.                \n        All deferred equity awards have cancellation and        \n        clawback provisions. Citi\u2019s equity awards are subject   \n        to cancellation and clawback provisions covering a      \n     \u25ba  range of circumstances, as set forth on page 88. In     \n        2022, we added a \u201cmaterial adverse outcome\u201d             \n        cancellation and clawback provision for our equity      \n        awards.                                                 \n        Stock ownership requirements. Executive officers are    \n        generally required to hold at least 75% of the net      \n        after-tax shares acquired through Citi\u2019s incentive      \n     \u25ba  compensation programs as long as they are executive     \n        officers and are required to retain at least 50% of     \n        the shares subject to the stock ownership commitment    \n        for one year after ceasing to be an executive officer,  \n        as a result of leaving Citi employment or otherwise.    \n        Share buybacks offset dilution from equity              \n     \u25ba  compensation programs. During 2021, we returned nearly  \n        $7.6 billion in capital to our shareholders through     \n        share repurchases.                                      \n        Equity compensation helps Citi to comply with its       \n        regulatory obligations. Regulatory guidance in the      \n        U.S. and in other countries in which Citi does          \n  \u25cf     business provides that a substantial portion of         \n        variable compensation awarded to senior executives and  \n        other employees whose actions have a material impact    \n        on the risk exposure of Citi should be awarded in       \n        shares.                                                 \n                                                                \nOverhang Table \u201cOverhang\u201d refers to the potential stockholder\ndilution represented by outstanding employee equity awards and\nshares available for future grants.\n                                                                \n                                 Record Date     April 26,      \n                 December 31,    (February       2022           \n                 2021            28, 2022)       (estimated)    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Simple         3.56%           2.97%           4.79%          \n  overhang(1)                                                   \n  Fully                                                         \n  diluted        3.44%           2.88%           4.57%          \n  overhang(2)                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       Simple overhang is the sum of outstanding equity awards  \n  (1)  and shares available for grant stated as a percentage    \n       of common shares outstanding.                            \n       Fully diluted overhang is the sum of outstanding equity  \n       awards and shares                                        \n       available for grant stated as a percentage of fully      \n  (2)  diluted common shares (i.e., common shares outstanding   \n       plus outstanding equity                                  \n       awards and shares available for grant under the stock    \n       incentive plans).                                        \n                                                                \nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                                          \n  Proposal 4: Approval of Additional Shares for the  111  \n  Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan                     \n                                                          \nRun Rate Table Our run rate is the number of shares subject to\nequity awards granted during a year stated as a percentage of\ncommon shares outstanding for such year, based on annual grant\ndata and the basic weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding as reported in Citigroup\u2019s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for such year.\n                                                                \n  Run rates for                                     Three-year  \n  12-month periods       2019     2020     2021     average     \n  ending December 31     0.66%    0.59%    0.86%    0.70%       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \nMitigating Dilution Through Return of Capital Our burn rate and\noverhang shown in the preceding Overhang Table and Run Rate\nTable reflect that our strong history of buying back shares\nlowers our shares outstanding and consequently increases the\nburn rate and overhang.

The 2019 Plan has a fixed number   \n  \u25cf  of shares available for grant that will not automatically  \n     increase because of an \u201cevergreen\u201d feature.                \n     Minimum one-year vesting requirement. Our one-year         \n  \u25cf  minimum vesting requirement will generally apply to at     \n     least 95% of the shares that may be granted pursuant to    \n     any type of award.                                         \n     A limit on total annual compensation for Directors. The    \n     maximum number of shares subject to awards to an           \n     individual Director in a calendar year, taken together     \n     with any cash fees paid                                    \n  \u25cf  during the calendar year to the Director for services as   \n     a member of the Board, may not exceed $1 million in        \n     value, except where the                                    \n     Board of Directors approves a higher limit for a           \n     non-executive Board chair.                                 \n     Annual limits on shares and options or SARs that can be    \n     granted to individual employees. The 2019 Plan limits the  \n     number of shares subject to stock options and SARs that    \n  \u25cf  may be granted in a calendar year to an individual         \n     employee to one million shares. Separately, the 2019 Plan  \n     limits the number of shares subject to stock awards that   \n     may be granted in a calendar year to an individual         \n     employee to one million shares.                            \n     No discounted options or SARs. Option or SAR exercise      \n  \u25cf  prices must be at least 100% of fair market value on the   \n     date an option or SAR is granted.                          \n     No repricings or cash buyouts. The 2019 Plan prohibits     \n     any \u201crepricing\u201d of any outstanding option or SAR, except   \n     with the approval of the stockholders of the Company. The  \n     2019 Plan defines \u201crepricing\u201d to mean (i) any action that  \n     constitutes a \u201crepricing\u201d under GAAP or the rules of the   \n     NYSE (including any modification or amendment to an        \n     outstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing  \n  \u25cf  its exercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an           \n     outstanding option or SAR when its exercise price exceeds  \n     its fair market value in exchange for cash; (iii) any      \n     cancellation of an option or SAR in exchange for a new     \n     option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or (iv) a       \n     substitution of a stock award for an option or SAR when    \n     its exercise price exceeds fair market value; in each      \n     case other than a permitted equitable adjustment.          \n     No reload option grants. Reload options are additional     \n  \u25cf  options that are granted automatically upon the exercise   \n     of previously granted options; options granted under the   \n     2019 Plan may not include a reload feature.                \n     No liberal share \u201crecycling.\u201d If an award under the 2019   \n     Plan, or, after April 16, 2019 (the effective date of the  \n     2019 Plan), the 2014 Plan and the 2009 Stock Incentive     \n     Plan (the 2009 Plan), is forfeited, cancelled, or expires  \n     or is settled without the issuance of shares, the shares   \n     subject to such award will be available for future grants  \n  \u25cf  under the 2019 Plan. However, the 2019 Plan prohibits      \n     re-granting shares withheld or tendered to pay option      \n     exercise prices, repurchased by the Company with option    \n     exercise proceeds, or withheld or tendered to satisfy tax  \n     withholding obligations on any award. Also, shares of      \n     stock subject to SARs that are not issued on settlement    \n     may not be re-granted.                                     \n     No dividend or dividend equivalent payments on unvested    \n     shares subject to a performance vesting condition. The     \n     2019 Plan permits payment of dividends or dividend         \n     equivalents on shares of restricted or deferred stock      \n  \u25cf  subject to a performance vesting condition only if and     \n     when the underlying shares vest. The 2019 Plan also        \n     prohibits the payment of dividends and dividend            \n     equivalents on shares subject to outstanding options and   \n     SARs.                                                      \n     A \u201cdouble trigger\u201d change of control provision. The 2019   \n     Plan requires that participants must experience an         \n     involuntary termination of employment for an award to      \n  \u25cf  vest as a result of a change of control of Citigroup Inc.  \n     (a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d). The Compensation Committee has also  \n     adopted a policy affirming that no deferred incentive      \n     awards to executive officers will vest solely by reason    \n     of a change of control of Citigroup Inc.                   \n     No excise tax gross-ups. The 2019 Plan does not provide    \n  \u25cf  for excise tax gross-ups in the event of a change of       \n     control of Citigroup Inc., nor do any executive            \n     agreements.                                                \n     No liberal definition of change of control.

Additionally, the 2019    \n     Plan defines a \u201cchange of control\u201d of Citigroup Inc. to    \n  \u25cf  mean: (i) a person acquiring direct or indirect            \n     beneficial ownership of Citigroup Inc. securities          \n     representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of   \n     then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii)        \n     specified changes in the majority of the Board (not        \n     including the election of Directors whose election or      \n     nomination was approved by a majority of the then          \n     incumbent Board); or (iii) a sale, transfer, or            \n     distribution of all or substantially all of the assets of  \n     Citigroup Inc., or a dissolution or liquidation of         \n     Citigroup Inc.                                             \n                                                                \nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                                          \n  Proposal 4: Approval of Additional Shares for the  113  \n  Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan                     \n                                                          \n                                                                \n     Ability to adopt sub-plans that facilitate participation   \n     by employees located outside the United States.

The initial share\nauthorization under the 2019 Plan was 30 million shares.\nPursuant to the amendment approved at the 2020 Annual Meeting,\nand the amendment approved at the 2021 Annual Meeting, the\nnumber of authorized shares increased by 15 million and 20\nmillion, respectively.

However, shares tendered by a participant\nor withheld by Citi to pay an option exercise price, withheld or\ntendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to any\naward, repurchased by Citi with option exercise proceeds,\ncovered by a stock-settled SAR (without regard to the number of\nshares actually issued upon exercise) or withheld to satisfy any\ndebt or other obligation owed to Citi, and cancelled fractional\nshares will be considered issued and shall not be added to the\nmaximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2019 Plan.\nLimits on awards. The maximum number of shares subject to awards\nto an individual Director in a calendar year (including awards\nmade at the election of a Director in lieu of his or her cash\nretainer), taken together with any cash fees paid during the\ncalendar year to the Director, in respect of the Director\u2019s\nservice as a member of the Board during such year (including\nservice as a member or chair of any committees of the Board),\nmay not exceed $1 million in value, as determined as of the date\nof each award. However, the independent members of the Board may\nmake exceptions to this limit for a non-executive chair of the\nBoard, provided that the Director receiving any additional\ncompensation may not participate in the decision to award such\ncompensation. For all other eligible \u201cemployees,\u201d the number of\nshares subject to stock options or SARs granted during a\ncalendar year may not exceed one million shares, and the number\nof shares that may be subject to stock awards granted in a\ncalendar year may not exceed one million shares, unless granted\nsubject to substitute awards that replace awards of a former\nemployer acquired by the Company. Types of awards. The following\ntypes of awards may be made under the 2019 Plan:\n                                                                \n     Stock options. An award of a stock option under the 2019   \n     Plan grants a participant the right to purchase a          \n     specified number of shares of Citi common stock during a   \n  \u25cf  specified term in the future at an exercise price equal    \n     to at least 100% of the \u201cfair market value\u201d (see below)    \n     of Citi common stock on the grant date. The term of a      \n     stock option may not exceed 10 years from the date of      \n     grant.                                                     \n     Stock appreciation rights (SARs). A SAR, upon exercise,    \n     entitles the participant to receive an amount equal to     \n     the difference between the fair market value of Citi       \n     common stock on the exercise date and the exercise price   \n     of the SAR (which may not be less than 100% of fair        \n  \u25cf  market value of a share of Citi common stock on the grant  \n     date) times the number of shares subject to the SAR.       \n     Payment to a participant upon the exercise of a SAR may    \n     be in cash and/or shares of Citi common stock. The term    \n     of a SAR may not exceed 10 years from the date of the      \n     grant.                                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     For purposes of setting the exercise price of any option   \n     or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, \u201cfair market value\u201d    \n     means the closing price on the NYSE (or on the principal   \n  \u27a2  national securities exchange on which the common stock is  \n     traded or quoted, if not the NYSE) on the date on which    \n     the stock option or SAR is granted. For all other          \n     purposes under the 2019 Plan, \u201cfair market value\u201d will be  \n     as determined by the Compensation Committee.               \n                                                                \nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                                                          \n  PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR THE  115  \n  CITIGROUP 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN                     \n                                                          \n                                                                \n  \u25cf  Stock payment. The Compensation Committee may grant        \n     vested shares of Citi common stock as a stock payment.     \n     Restricted stock. A restricted stock award is an award of  \n     outstanding shares of Citi common stock that does not      \n     vest until vesting conditions are satisfied and which      \n     will be forfeited if conditions to vesting are not met.    \n  \u25cf  Participants may receive dividends on the shares subject   \n     to their awards during the vesting period, unless the      \n     awards are subject to one or more performance conditions,  \n     in which case the dividends, if any, shall be paid only    \n     if and when, and only to the extent that, the underlying   \n     shares vest.                                               \n     Deferred stock. A deferred stock award is an unfunded,     \n     unsecured promise to deliver shares of Citi common stock   \n     to the participant in the future, if the participant       \n     satisfies the conditions to vesting. Participants do not   \n     have voting rights (their rights are no greater than a     \n  \u25cf  general unsecured creditor of the Company), but may        \n     receive dividend equivalent payments during the vesting    \n     period, unless the awards are subject to one or more       \n     performance conditions, in which case the dividend         \n     equivalents, if any, shall be paid to participants only    \n     if and when, and only to the extent that, the underlying   \n     shares vest.                                               \n     Other stock-based awards. The Compensation Committee may   \n     grant any other award that is denominated in shares of     \n     Citi common stock and that may be settled by the delivery  \n  \u25cf  of shares and/or cash. For the avoidance of doubt, awards  \n     that by their terms shall be settled only in cash shall    \n     not be considered to have been granted under the 2019      \n     Plan.                                                      \n     Performance-based awards. Subject to the terms of the      \n     2019 Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant awards     \n  \u25cf  that are subject to one or more performance conditions     \n     related to a performance period of not less than one       \n     year.                                                      \n                                                                \nMinimum vesting requirement. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan\nmay not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date on\nwhich the award is granted, except that the Compensation\nCommittee may grant awards that vest in less than a year (i) as\na \u201csubstitute award\u201d to replace awards of a former employer\nacquired by the Company, (ii) awards to Directors that vest on\nthe earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and\nthe next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50\nweeks after the immediately preceding year\u2019s annual meeting, and\n(iii) any additional awards the Compensation Committee may\ngrant, up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available\nshare reserve authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan. This\nrestriction does not apply to the Compensation Committee\u2019s\ndiscretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting\nof any award, including in cases of retirement, death,\ndisability, leave of absence, termination of employment, change\nof control, or upon the sale or other disposition of the\nsubsidiary employing a participant or other similar event.\nPerformance conditions. In the case of an award subject to a\nperformance condition, the applicable performance condition may\ninclude one or more of the following performance conditions and\nbe expressed in either, or a combination of, absolute or\nrelative values or a percentage of: revenue, revenue or product\ngrowth, net income (pre- or after-tax), earnings, earnings per\nshare, stockholders\u2019 equity or return on stockholders\u2019 equity,\nassets or return on assets, return on risk-adjusted assets,\ncapital or return on capital, return on risk capital, book value\nor book value per share, economic value-added models or\nequivalent metrics, operating income, pre- or after-tax income,\nexpenses or reengineering savings, margins, cash flow or cash\nflow per share, stock price, total shareholder return, market\nshare, debt reduction, net promoter scores, operating efficiency\nratios, expense ratios, liquidity ratios, regulatory\nachievements, or any objective or subjective performance\nconditions selected by the Compensation Committee.

The 2019 Plan defines \u201crepricing\u201d to mean: (i) any\naction that constitutes a \u201crepricing\u201d under GAAP or the rules of\nthe NYSE (including any modification or amendment to an\noutstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing its\nexercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an outstanding option\nor SAR when its exercise price exceeds its fair market value in\nexchange for cash; (iii) any cancellation of an option or SAR in\nexchange for a new option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or\n(iv) a substitution of a stock award for an option or SAR when\nits exercise price exceeds fair market value; in each case other\nthan a permitted equitable adjustment.

If the Compensation\nCommittee subsequently determines that all conditions to vesting\nand payment of an award, or the vesting and exercisability of an\noption or SAR, were not satisfied in full, the Compensation\nCommittee may cancel such vesting or exercise and refuse to\nissue shares and immediately terminate the participant\u2019s rights\nwith respect to such award (or improperly vested portion\nthereof). If the vesting or exercise of any such award (or\nportion thereof) has already been settled by delivery of shares\nor cash, the participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to\nreturn the shares or cash (or higher value received at vesting\nor exercise), to Citi, without reduction for any shares or cash\nwithheld to satisfy withholding tax or other obligations.\nConsistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal\nRevenue Code, the 2019 Plan also provides for the set-off of\nvested awards against obligations a participant may owe to Citi,\nincluding but not limited to the obligation to repay improperly\nvested or exercised awards. Any failure to timely pay tax-\nrelated obligations owed to Citi in connection with an award may\nresult in its cancellation. Non-transferability. During the\nvesting period, awards and sale-restricted shares generally are\nnot transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and\ndistribution. Adjustments. The 2019 Plan provides that the\nCompensation Committee shall make appropriate equitable\nadjustments to the maximum number of shares available for grant\nunder the 2019 Plan and to the annual individual award limits\nexpressed in numbers of shares in the event of any changes to\nthe Company\u2019s capital structure, including a change in the\nnumber of shares outstanding on account of any stock dividend,\nstock split, reverse stock split, spinoff or any similar equity\nrestructuring, or any combination or exchange of equity\nsecurities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization,\nreorganization, or similar transaction. In the event of any such\ntransaction, or any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or\nother distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of\nassets to stockholders, the Compensation Committee shall make\nappropriate equitable adjustments to the number or kind of\nshares subject to outstanding awards, the exercise prices of\noutstanding options and SARs, and performance conditions, to the\nextent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of\nparticipants\u2019 rights. Change of control. The Compensation\nCommittee may, when an award is made, or at any time prior to,\nat, or after the time of a \u201cchange of control\u201d (as defined\nbelow), provide for the adjustment of performance conditions to\nreflect the change of control, provide for the cancellation of\noutstanding awards if the surviving entity or acquiring entity\n(or the surviving or acquiring entity\u2019s parent company) replaces\nthe awards with new rights of substantially equivalent value,\nprovide for the acceleration of any time periods or the waiver\nof any other conditions to vesting, exercise, payment, or\ndistribution of an award upon an involuntary termination of a\nparticipant\u2019s employment as a result of a change of control, or\nprovide for the purchase of any award. The vesting, payment,\npurchase, or distribution of an award, however, may not be\naccelerated by reason of a change of control for any participant\nunless the participant\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated\nas a result of the change of control. For these purposes, a\ntermination of employment as a result of a change of control\nmeans involuntary termination of employment other than for\n\u201cgross misconduct\u201d (as defined in the 2019 Plan) upon, or on or\nprior to the first anniversary of, the change of control. The\n2019 Plan defines a \u201cchange of control\u201d to mean (i) a person\nacquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership of Citigroup\nInc. securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting\npower of then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii)\nspecified changes in the majority of the Board (not including\nthe election of Directors whose election or nomination was\napproved by a majority of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a\nsale, transfer, or distribution of all or substantially all of\nthe assets of Citigroup Inc. or a dissolution or liquidation of\nCitigroup Inc.; or (iv) consummation of a reorganization,\nmerger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction that\nresults in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not owning more than\n50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other\ncorporation resulting from the transaction. Tax withholding.\nCiti retains the right to deduct or withhold, or require the\nparticipant to remit to his or her employer, an amount\nsufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, and foreign taxes\n(including hypothetical taxes owed to Citi by tax-equalized\nexpatriates) required by law or regulation to be withheld with\nrespect to any taxable event as a result of the 2019 Plan.

Effective August 13, 2021, the 2019 Plan was amended to\nprovide that unless the Compensation Committee determines\notherwise, participants who receive awards of stock are\ngenerally entitled to direct the voting of the shares underlying\ntheir awards on matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. All\nshares underlying such awards as to which no voting instructions\nare received are voted proportionately, based on the voting\ninstructions received with respect to all other such shares.\nAmendment and termination. The 2019 Plan may be amended,\nsuspended, or terminated by the Compensation Committee at any\ntime, provided that no amendment shall be made without\nstockholder approval if it would materially increase the number\nof shares available under the 2019 Plan (other than in\nconnection with an equitable adjustment), materially expand the\ntypes of awards available under the 2019 Plan or the class of\npersons eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan, materially\nextend the term of the 2019 Plan, materially change the method\nof determining the exercise price of an option or SAR granted\nunder the 2019 Plan, delete or limit the prohibition against\n\u201crepricing,\u201d or otherwise require approval by stockholders in\norder to comply with applicable law or the rules of the NYSE (or\nprincipal national securities exchange upon which Citi\u2019s common\nstock is traded or quoted). Award modification. The Compensation\nCommittee retains the right to modify outstanding awards without\na participant\u2019s prior consent if it determines that the\nmodification is required to comply with applicable law,\nregulation, or regulatory guidance (including applicable tax\nlaw). Subject to certain exceptions, any other modifications, if\nadverse to a participant, shall not be effective without the\nparticipant\u2019s written consent. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax\nConsequences The following is a brief summary of the principal\nU.S. federal income tax consequences relating to stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, based on current U.S. federal\nincome tax laws. This summary does not constitute tax advice\nand, among other things, does not describe state, local, or\nforeign tax consequences, which may be substantially different.\nGenerally, a participant will not recognize taxable income on\nthe grant of a stock option. Upon the exercise of a stock\noption, a participant will recognize ordinary income in an\namount equal to the difference between the fair market value of\nthe Citi common stock received on the date of exercise and the\noption cost (number of shares purchased multiplied by the\nexercise price per share). The participant will recognize\nordinary income upon the exercise of the option even though the\nshares acquired may be subject to further restrictions on sale\nor transferability. Citi will ordinarily be entitled to a\ndeduction on the exercise date in an amount equal to the amount\nof ordinary income recognized by the participant upon exercise,\nexcept as may be specified under Section 162(m) of the Internal\nRevenue Code. Generally, upon a subsequent sale of shares\nacquired in an option exercise, the difference between the sale\nproceeds and the cost basis of the shares sold will be taxable\nas a capital gain or loss, including any sale of shares freed\nfrom sale restrictions to fund the payment of taxes incurred at\nexercise. The 2019 Plan does not provide for awards of\n\u201cincentive stock options,\u201d which have different tax consequences\nunder the Internal Revenue Code. www.citigroup.com Table of\nContents\n       \n  118  \n       \nStockholder Proposals Citi makes every effort to be responsive\nto concerns expressed by our stockholders by engaging in\ndialogues, participating in issuer/investor working groups, and\nadopting policies or initiatives we believe to be in the best\ninterests of all stockholders. Over the years, Citi has met with\nseveral proponents and other interested parties regarding such\nissues as gender pay equity, proxy access, human rights, climate\nchange, net zero, racial equity, culture, risk management,\nauditor rotation, and trade association payments, among others,\nand has, on certain occasions, as appropriate, taken action in\nresponse to these engagements and/or stockholder votes. For\nexample, in 2019, Citi\u2019s Board of Directors lowered the Special\nMeeting threshold in response to the stockholder vote at the\n2019 Annual Meeting. We encourage our stockholders to\ncommunicate with management and the Board. Any stockholder\nwishing to communicate with management, the Board, or an\nindividual Director, or obtain the addresses of any of the\nstockholder proponents or their Citi stock ownership\ninformation, should send a request to the Corporate Secretary,\nBrent McIntosh, at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York\n10013. Proposal 5 John Chevedden has submitted the following\nproposal for consideration at the 2022 Annual Meeting. Proposal\n5 \u2014 Management Pay Clawback Authorization\n                      \n  FOR    Shareholder  \n         Rights       \n                      \nRESOLVED, shareholders urge the Board of Directors to provide\nfor a General Clawback policy that a substantial portion of\nannual total compensation of Executive Officers, identified by\nthe board, shall be deferred and be forfeited in part or in\nwhole, at the discretion of Board, to help satisfy any monetary\npenalty associated with any violation of law regardless of any\ndetermined responsibility by any individual officer; and that\nthis annual deferred compensation be paid to the officers no\nsooner than 3 years after the absence of any monetary penalty;\nand that any forfeiture and relevant circumstances be reported\nto shareholders in the annual meeting proxy. This proposal shall\napply to the Executive Officers, whether or not they were\nresponsible for any associated monetary penalty. These\nprovisions should operate prospectively and be implemented in a\nway that does not violate any contract, compensation plan, law\nor regulation. Executives would be asked to waive any provisions\napplicable to them that might delay implementation of this\nproposal. On July 14, 2014, the Department of Justice \"announced\na $7 billion settlement with Citigroup Inc. to resolve ...\nclaims related to Citigroup's conduct in the ... issuance of\nresidential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) prior to Jan. 1,\n2009. The resolution includes a $4 billion civil penalty - the\nlargest penalty to date under the Financial Institutions Reform,\nRecovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) .... Citigroup\nacknowledged it made serious misrepresentations to the public.\"\nThis monetary penalty was borne by Citi shareholders who were\nnot responsible for this unlawful conduct. Citi employees\ncommitted these unlawful acts. They did not contribute to this\npenalty payment, but instead undoubtedly received bonuses.\nPresident William Dudley of the New York Federal Reserve\noutlined the utility of what he called a performance bond. \"In\nthe case of a large fine, the senior management ... would\nforfeit their performance bond .... Each individual's ability to\nrealize their deferred debt compensation would depend not only\non their own behavior, but also on the behavior of their\ncolleagues. This would create a strong incentive for individuals\nto monitor the\u00b7actions of their colleagues, and to call\nattention to any issues .... Importantly, individuals would not\nbe able to \"opt out\" of the firm as a way of escaping the\nproblem. If a person knew that something is amiss and decided to\nleave the firm, their deferred debt compensation would still be\nat risk.\" Please vote yes: Management Pay Clawback Authorization\n\u2014 Proposal 5 Citi 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  Stockholder Proposals  119  \n                              \nManagement Comment Summary The proposal requests that the Board\nadopt a policy providing that payment of a substantial portion\nof annual total compensation of Citi\u2019s executive officers be\ndeferred for at least three years and forfeited to help satisfy\nany monetary penalty assessed against Citi associated with any\nviolation of law and that any such forfeited amount be publicly\ndisclosed. Adopting such a policy would be adverse to\nshareholder interests because of its impact on Citi\u2019s ability to\nrecruit and retain employees. As background, Citi has had in\nplace for many years a policy of deferring substantial portions\nof bonus-eligible employees\u2019 compensation for up to four years,\nand subjecting those deferred amounts to forfeiture, and to\nclawback, in a range of circumstances. Critically, those\ncircumstances generally involve culpability on the part of the\nemployee. The shareholder proposal would not. Instead, the\nshareholder proposal would require executives to bear the cost\nof monetary penalties associated with any violation of law, even\nif the executive is not in any way responsible for the violation\nand without regard to the amount of the penalty. Citi believes\nthat is not consistent with market practices among employers\nfrom which Citi recruits its executives, and therefore it would\nput Citi at a competitive disadvantage in recruiting and\nretaining key employees. In addition to being inconsistent with\nmarket practices, Citi believes that many current and potential\nexecutives would view the shareholder proposal as unfair, just\nas shareholders view it as unfair that they have to bear the\ncost of penalties imposed on the corporation for which they have\nno responsibility. The Board agrees that it\u2019s unfair in both\ncases. Those responsible for the conduct should be responsible\nfor the consequences, which is how Citi\u2019s compensation program\nworks now. Similarly, for the flip side of that coin, Citi bases\nits rewards on contributions and performance. Citi notes that\nthe financial interests of Citi\u2019s executives are in any case\nextensively aligned with the interests of shareholders, as (1) a\nsubstantial portion of executive compensation is directly tied\nto stock price performance, (2) an additional portion of\nexecutive compensation is indirectly tied to stock price\nperformance because it is tied to financial performance, and (3)\nexecutives are subject to a stock ownership commitment that\nrequires them to hold a substantial portion of the stock awarded\nto them as compensation until their retirement.

Proposal 6 \u2014\nIndependent Board Chairman\n                      \n  FOR    Shareholder  \n         Rights       \n                      \nThe shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an\nenduring policy, and amend the governing documents as necessary\nin order that 2 separate people hold the office of the Chairman\nand the office of the CEO as follows: Selection of the Chairman\nof the Board The Board requires the separation of the offices of\nthe Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer.\nWhenever possible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an\nIndependent Director. The Board has the discretion to select a\nTemporary Chairman of the Board who is not an Independent\nDirector to serve while the Board is seeking an Independent\nChairman of the Board. The Chairman shall not be a former CEO of\nthe company. This policy could be phased in when there is a\ncontract renewal for our current CEO or for the next CEO\ntransition. This proposal topic won 52% support at Boeing and\n54% support at Baxter International in 2020. Boeing then adopted\nthis proposal topic in 2020. The roles of Chairman and CEO are\nfundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO\nand a Chairman who is completely independent of the CEO and our\ncompany. With the current CEO serving as Chair this means giving\nup a substantial check and balance safeguard that can only occur\nwith an independent Board Chairman. A lead director is no\nsubstitute for an independent board chairman. A lead director\ncannot call a special shareholder meeting and cannot even call a\nspecial meeting of the board. A lead director can delegate most\nof the lead director duties to the CEO office and then simply\nrubber-stamp it. There is no way shareholders can be sure of\nwhat goes on. The lack of an independent Board Chairman is an\nunfortunate way to discourage new outside ideas and an\nunfortunate way to encourage the CEO to pursue pet projects that\nwould not stand up to effective oversight.

The Board firmly\nsupports having an independent Director in a Board leadership\nposition at all times. As such, Citi\u2019s Board, on December 15,\n2009, adopted a By-law amendment which provides that if Citi\ndoes not have an independent Chair, the Board will elect an\nindependent Lead Director having similar duties to an\nindependent Chair, including leading the executive sessions of\nthe non-management Directors at Board meetings. Citi\u2019s Board has\ndetermined that the current structure, an independent Chair\nseparate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure at this\ntime, while ensuring that, at all times, there will be an\nindependent Director in a Board leadership position. Since\nCiti\u2019s Board has adopted a framework that provides for either an\nindependent Chair or an independent Lead Director, the Board\nbelieves that this Proposal is not necessary. Important Points\nto Consider\n                                                                \n     As required by Citi\u2019s By-Laws, the Board elects its        \n     Chairman annually, and, for each of the last 11 years,     \n     the Board has elected an independent director to serve as  \n     Board Chair. Citi\u2019s By-laws ensure that there will be an   \n     independent member of the Board in a leadership position   \n     at all times. Rather than formally separating the roles    \n  \u27a2  of CEO and Chairman, it is in the best interests of        \n     Citi\u2019s shareholders to retain flexibility to determine     \n     the optimal leadership structure at any given time, while  \n     ensuring that an independent board member oversees the     \n     Board. The Board values the flexibility of selecting the   \n     structure of leadership best suited to meet the needs of   \n     the Company and its shareholders.                          \n     If the roles of Chairman and CEO are combined, Citi\u2019s      \n     Guidelines provide that the Board will designate a lead    \n  \u27a2  director from among the independent directors. As set      \n     forth in the Guidelines, the duties of the independent     \n     Lead Director and the non-executive chair include, but     \n     are not limited to, the following functions:               \n                                                                \n\u2713 presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chair is\nnot present, including executive sessions of the independent\nDirectors; \u2713 serving as liaison between the Executive Chair and\nthe independent Directors; \u2713 approving information sent to the\nBoard; \u2713 approving meeting agendas for the Board; \u2713 approving\nmeeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for\ndiscussion of all agenda items; and \u2713 having the authority to\ncall meetings of the independent Directors.\n                                                                \n     Citi has an empowered independent Board that provides      \n     oversight. As previously noted, Citi has had an            \n     independent Chair since 2009. Thirteen of the Board\u2019s      \n     fifteen current directors, and 100% of each of the         \n     Board\u2019s Audit Committee; Nomination, Governance and        \n  \u27a2  Public Affairs Committee; and Personnel and Compensation   \n     Committee satisfy the independence standards of the NYSE,  \n     Citi\u2019s independence standards, and other regulatory        \n     independence requirements. Moreover, the Board holds       \n     executive sessions of its independent directors            \n     throughout the year, at which the independent Chair        \n     presides.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  The shareholder proposal is unnecessary given the   \n  current framework the Board has in place to ensure  \n  independent leadership for the Board at all times   \n  and could restrict the Board\u2019s decision-making      \n  ability and limit the options available to the      \n  Board in structuring effective leadership;          \n  therefore the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this  \n  Proposal 6.                                         \n                                                      \nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  122  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nProposal 7 The Sisters of St. Joseph, Missionary Oblates of Mary\nImmaculate, Monasterio Pan de Vida, and The Sisters of St.\nFrancis of Philadelphia have submitted the following proposal\nfor consideration at the 2022 Annual Meeting. Resolved:\nShareholders request that the Board of Directors provide a\nreport to shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting\nproprietary and confidential information, outlining how\neffective Citigroup\u2019s policies, practices, and performance\nindicators are in respecting internationally recognized human\nrights standards for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights in its existing\nand proposed general corporate and project financing. Whereas:\nInternationally-recognized standards for Indigenous Peoples\u2019\nrights are the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous\nPeoples and International Labour Organization Convention 169\nconcerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent\nCountries. 1Violation of the rights of Indigenous Peoples\npresents risks for Citigroup that can adversely affect\nshareholder value, including reputational damage, project delays\nand disruptions, litigation, and criminal charges. 2As a\ncofounder of the Equator Principles (EPs) in 2003, Citigroup was\na leader in committing to only finance projects by borrowers who\nexhibit social and environmental responsibility. 3The company\nfaces reputational risk if it finances projects that conflict\nwith its own commitments. Despite contributing to EP\nenhancements in 2019 after its failure to respect Indigenous\nRights as a lead financier of the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL),\nCitigroup is providing over $5 billion in financing for the\nEnbridge Line 3 tar sands pipeline expansion \u201cLine 3\u201d. 4 Similar\nto DAPL, Line 3 poses significant risks to the land, water, and\ncultural rights of several Anishinaabe tribes. The expansion\nviolates numerous rights of Indigenous Peoples as protected by\ninternational law, including the rights to free, prior, and\ninformed consent (FPIC); health; culture; religion; security;\nand assembly. 5In particular, Line 3 threatens access to and\nhealth of manoomin or wild rice, which is central to the\nsurvival of Anishinaabe culture. 6The pipeline, with estimated\nemissions equivalent to 50 coal plants, significantly\ncontributes to climate change, disparately affecting Tribes.\n7Enbridge and its partners have consistently failed to meet the\ninternational standard of FPIC as well as domestic standards of\nconsultation with the Anishinaabe. 8 In response to protests\nagainst DAPL at Citigroup\u2019s 2017 annual meeting, the former\nboard chairman wished Citigroup \u201ccould have a do-over on this.\u201d\n9Line 3 presents similar material risks as DAPL, which was\nestimated to incur over $7.5 billion in costs due to material\nsocial risks. 10Line 3 has a history of ruptures and spills,\nmost recently spilling approximately 10,000 gallons of drilling\nfluid between July and August 2021. 11The project has been the\nsubject of numerous lawsuits, including challenges to the Clean\nWater Act permit and tribal court litigation on the natural\nrights of manoomin . 12 Furthermore, militarized response to\nprotests and alleged violation of constitutional rights exposes\nCitigroup to reputational and litigation risk. 13Enbridge has\nreimbursed U.S. law enforcement over $2 million for policing\nprotests against the construction of Line 3. 14There have been\nover 900 arrests, citations, and charges levied against Water\nProtectors, as well as harassment, surveillance, 15instances of\nsex trafficking, and violence against women. 16\n                                                                \n      https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/d\u2026  \n  1   ;                                                         \n      https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100\u2026  \n  2   https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/file\u2026  \n  3   https://www.citigroup.com/citi/sustainability/evolution\u2026  \n  4   https://www.                                              \n      ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RAN-Briefing_Line3_K\u2026  \n  5   https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/file\u2026  \n  6   https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58a3c10abebafb5c\u2026  \n  7   https://mn350.org/giant-step-backward/                    \n  8   https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Doc\u2026  \n  9   https://www.reuters.com/article/us-citigroup-shareholde\u2026  \n  10  https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/file\u2026  \n                                                                \nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  123  \n                              \n                                                                \n  11  https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/08/16/enbridge-line-\u2026  \n  12  https://www.hcn.org/articles/latest-justice-wild-rice-s\u2026  \n  13  https://www.promisehumanrights.blog/blog/2021/10/oil-fl\u2026  \n  14  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/05/line-3-\u2026  \n  15  https://theintercept.com/2021/08/07/minnesota-pipeline-\u2026  \n      https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/03/08/shelter-report\u2026  \n  16  ;                                                         \n      https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gkpw/four-enbridge-pi\u2026  \n                                                                \nManagement Comment Summary The Proposal requests that Citi\nprepare a report to shareholders outlining how effective\nCitigroup\u2019s policies, practices, and performance indicators are\nin respecting internationally recognized human rights standards\nfor Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights in its existing and proposed\ngeneral corporate and project financing. In the supporting\nstatement to the Proposal, the proponent states that Citi is\npurportedly providing $5 billion in financing to the Enbridge\nLine 3 pipeline expansion, which is a grossly inaccurate\nstatement. Citi has not provided any project-related financing\nto the Enbridge Line 3 project and our capital extended to the\nentire portfolio of oil and gas storage and transportation sub-\nsector across numerous clients was only ~$7.17 billion in total\nat 2021 year-end (as disclosed on p. 53 of our 2021 Task Force\non Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report: Citi\u2019s Approach\nto Climate Change and Net Zero), with no one client comprising\nanywhere close to a majority of the portfolio. Nonetheless, in\nsensitive sectors such as oil and gas, Citi reviews client\nportfolios to benchmark environmental and social policies and\npractices as well as potential \u201cAreas of High Caution\u201d such as\nIndigenous Peoples risks that trigger enhanced due diligence and\nengagement. Citi regularly engages with Enbridge on their\nenvironmental impact analysis, community consultation,\nIndigenous engagement and cultural heritage policies and\nprocesses to evaluate implementation of responsible practices.\nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     Citi has demonstrated a commitment to environmental        \n     sustainability and human rights since 2003 through its     \n     Environmental and Social Risk Management (\u201cESRM\u201d) Policy.  \n     This official Company policy sets forth standards for how  \n     the Company assesses its clients\u2019 management of impacts    \n     on the environment (such as biodiversity, pollution        \n     control, climate) and society (such as employee health     \n     and safety, human rights of local communities and          \n     Indigenous Peoples), etc. As part of Citi\u2019s commitment to  \n  \u27a2  the communities in which it works, in 2018 the Company     \n     updated its ESRM Policy to strengthen and expand its Area  \n     of High Caution on Indigenous Peoples globally. The ESRM   \n     Policy incorporates the International Finance Corporation  \n     (IFC) Performance Standards and the Equator Principles, a  \n     leading financial sector risk management framework for     \n     project related finance that Citi helped to co-found in    \n     2003. Both of these frameworks cover aspects of human      \n     rights, particularly stakeholder engagement, labor issues  \n     and the rights of Indigenous Peoples.                      \n     Citi has long been engaged on human rights issues. In      \n     2007, Citi became the first major U.S. bank to publish a   \n     Statement on Human Rights which has been updated as        \n     needed over time to reflect evolving market practice.      \n     Citi\u2019s Statement publicly affirms its commitment to        \n     respecting the fundamental human rights in the Universal   \n     Declaration on Human Rights and the International Labour   \n     Organization core conventions as well as supporting the    \n     United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human    \n     Rights. Our most recent update of the Statement expanded   \n  \u27a2  the list of salient human rights issues across the         \n     Company\u2019s value chain that it closely monitors. The        \n     Statement describes how the Company monitors and responds  \n     to human rights issues related to the Company\u2019s business   \n     operations, including its employees\u2019 human rights and      \n     those of its suppliers\u2019 workers, as well as those related  \n     to its clients\u2019 activities. Citi has in fact been          \n     recognized as a \u201cleader\u201d in integrating respect for human  \n     rights into its business by civil society organizations.   \n     To review our Statement on Human Rights and other ESRM     \n     Policy-related information, please visit the               \n     \u201cEnvironmental and Social Information\u201d on Citi\u2019s website.  \n                                                                \nww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  124  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \n                                                                \n     To promote its commitment to sustainability, the Board     \n     has delegated authority to the Nomination, Governance and  \n     Public Affairs Committee to \u201creceive reports from and      \n     advise management on the Company\u2019s sustainability          \n  \u27a2  policies and programs, including the environment, climate  \n     change and human rights\u201d and to review \u201cthe Company\u2019s      \n     policies and programs that relate to public issues of      \n     significance to the Company and the public at large . . .  \n     and advise management as to its approach.\u201d                 \n     Citi\u2019s Board and management are committed to working       \n     together to continue to advance the company\u2019s commitment   \n     to human rights. Over the past couple of years, Citi has   \n     been proud of the initiatives we have supported, which     \n     include the expansion of the Statement on Human Rights;    \n     enhancing our ESRM Policy due diligence approach to        \n     financing of projects with potential Indigenous Peoples    \n     impacts and leading similar enhancements to the Equator    \n  \u27a2  Principles framework; our annual reporting on our efforts  \n     to combat modern slavery through an annual U.K. Modern     \n     Slavery Act Statement; raising our minimum wage globally;  \n     and addressing gender and minority pay equity gaps, among  \n     others. These and other initiatives are disclosed in our   \n     annual Environmental, Social, and Governance Report,       \n     which details our efforts in human rights as it relates    \n     to inclusive growth, an inspired workforce, and our        \n     ethical and responsible standards.                         \n     The Proposal rightly highlights Citi\u2019s leadership in       \n     developing the Equator Principles (\u201cEP\u201d), industry         \n     standards in environmental and social risk management in   \n     project-related finance, as well as our leadership role    \n     in strengthening EP due diligence requirements for         \n     financing projects with impacts to Indigenous Peoples \u2013    \n     leading to strengthened practices across the market.       \n     However, despite this recognition, the proponents fail to  \n     acknowledge that the EPs apply only to project-related     \n     loans where banks have increased risk and leverage, and    \n     do not apply to general corporate purpose financings. In   \n     addition, Citi\u2019s ESRM Policy goes beyond minimum EP        \n  \u27a2  requirements and commits to enhanced due diligence on      \n     transactions and clients with Indigenous Peoples risks     \n     under the Areas of High Caution part of our policy even    \n     when we are not directly financing a project. While banks  \n     do not have the same project-level leverage in general     \n     corporate finance, we still review and engage clients      \n     when these Areas of High Caution are present. Enbridge is  \n     a Citi client where our relationship provides general      \n     corporate purposes financing across a number of            \n     subsidiaries. Citi regularly engages with Enbridge on      \n     their environmental impact analysis, community             \n     consultation, Indigenous engagement and cultural heritage  \n     policies and processes to evaluate implementation of       \n     responsible practices.                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  The report requested by the Proposal is unnecessary as our    \n  current practices effectively address the                     \n  primary concerns outlined in the Proposal; therefore, the     \n  Board recommends that you                                     \n  vote AGAINST this Proposal 7.                                 \n                                                                \nProposal 8 Harrington Investments, Inc. and Boston Common Asset\nManagement have submitted the following proposal for\nconsideration at the 2022 Annual Meeting.

Supporting Statement Citigroup, as a member of the\nNet Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), commits to align financing\nwith a maximum temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius. 1To\nclose the gap between words and action, a change in policy is\nneeded on financing of fossil fuel exploration and development.\nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  125  \n                              \nThe United Nations Environmental Program Finance Initiative\n(UNEPFI), which convenes the NZBA, published an Input Paper to\nthe G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group which defines credible\nnet zero commitments of financial institutions, including: \u201cA\nfinancial institution establishing a net-zero commitment should\nbegin aligning with the required assumptions and implications of\nIPCC 1.5\u00b0C no/low overshoot pathways as soon as possible\u2026.All\nno/low overshoot scenarios indicate an immediate reduction in\nfossil fuels, signaling that investment in new fossil fuel\ndevelopment is not aligned with 1.5\u00b0C.\u201d 2The International\nEnergy Agency (IEA) has concluded, \u201cThere is no need for\ninvestment in new fossil fuel supply in our net zero pathway.\u201d 3\nCitigroup has not committed to end funding of fossil fuel\nexpansion. It reportedly recently financed an expanding coal\noperation in Russia. In September 2021 Bloomberg reported that\nRussia\u2019s largest coal producer and coal plant operator, JSC\nSUEK, had mandated nine banks, including Citigroup, for a bond\nissuance with a 5-year maturity. 4JSC SUEK produces over 100\nmillion tons of coal per year. It is expanding coal mining\noperations for an additional 25 million tons per year. SUEK\u2019s\ncoal exports are set for expansion by around 28 million tons per\nyear. An observer noted, \u201cSUEK plays a central, if not THE\ncentral role in Russia\u2019s scheme to profit as much as possible\nfrom the coal industry before the fossil era ends. It is\noutrageous that US and German banks are still helping to raise\nmoney for one of the world\u2019s largest coal companies only two\nmonths before COP26 in Glasgow.\u201d 5 Ernst-Jan Kuiper of BankTrack\nadded: \u201cThe participation of US and German banks in this bond\nissuance is particularly surprising given their net-zero\npledges\u2026. we need to see more from banks than signing showy net-\nzero initiatives.\u201d Financing of new oil and gas exploration and\ndevelopment is also inconsistent with the global goals.

Citi\u2019s recent net zero plan and\n2030 targets are more specific than what the Proposal advocates\nfor, which is a blanket commitment to not finance Energy\ncompanies. The Proposal also fails to take into account dynamics\nthat are important to consider as part of a comprehensive\nstrategy to assist in the transition to a net zero economy.\nCutting off clients\u2019 access to lending and investment banking\nservices immediately, as opposed to helping drive an orderly low\ncarbon transition over time, could have significant negative\nconsequences for Citi, its customers and its shareholders, as\nwell as many communities in the U.S. and globally. Such drastic\naction also may not result in reduced global greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions, as these client relationships could shift to\nother financial institutions that are not committed to helping\ncompanies transition. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                              \n  126  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n  \u27a2  Citi\u2019s commitment to net zero transition:                  \n     In March 2021, Citi announced its commitment to net zero   \n     GHG emissions by 2050 and in January 2022 published its    \n     initial net zero plan related to this important            \n     commitment including interim emissions targets for 2030    \n     for the Citi\u2019s Energy and Power portfolios. These targets  \n     are ambitious, based on climate science, and will be       \n     achieved based on an implementation strategy that is       \n     focused on helping our clients to transition. Citi         \n     believes that the combination of ambitious net zero        \n     targets combined with a focus on helping its clients to    \n     transition is a better approach than terminating clients.  \n  \u27a2  Citi\u2019s engagement with clients:                            \n     Citi and many of its clients recognize the significance    \n     of the collective effort needed to address our global      \n     climate challenges. Many clients have committed or are     \n     expected to commit to plans and targets to adapt their     \n     business models. Citi believes that it can support these   \n     clients and others as they make these fundamental shifts   \n     to their businesses in the coming years. Citi has          \n     expertise that it believes it can use to responsibly       \n     support these companies in this process. The Proposal,     \n     however, assumes, that terminating lending and             \n     underwriting relationships is the best strategy to         \n     fulfill the IEA\u2019s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Roadmap, and  \n     refers in their supporting statement to the United         \n     Nations Environmental Program Finance Initiative (\u201cUNEP    \n     FI\u201d) Recommendations for Credible Net-Zero Commitments     \n     from Financial Institutions. In fact, the UNEP FI          \n     recommendations acknowledge that immediate divestment is   \n     not necessarily the right approach for achieving net zero  \n     goals. Further, the UNEP FI recommendations acknowledge    \n     that methodologies for portfolio emission reductions can   \n     be \u201cmeasured and deployed through a variety of approaches  \n     (methodologies and metrics), all of which are still        \n     evolving.\u201d                                                 \n  \u27a2  Environmental and Social Risk Management:                  \n     Citi has a long-standing Environmental and Social Risk     \n     Management (ESRM) Policy, which has added in recent years  \n     specific sector approaches, including for thermal coal     \n     mining and coal-fired power. Notably, in 2020 and 2021,    \n     we updated our ESRM sector approaches to establish phase   \n     out targets for financing of thermal coal mining           \n     companies by 2025 and 2030; we updated our coal-fired      \n     power approach to set expectations that our coal-fired     \n     power clients transition in alignment with the Paris       \n     Agreement; and set project-related financing prohibitions  \n     for new thermal coal mines, new coal-fired power plants,   \n     and Arctic oil and gas exploration and development. The    \n     Energy sector, however, must continue to provide access    \n     to energy while transitioning to zero and low-carbon       \n     emissions. Citi\u2019s approach to the decarbonization of its   \n     Energy loan portfolio is focused on helping clients        \n     accelerate this transition.                                \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  Citi has already substantially achieved the         \n  objectives of the Proposal with the establishment   \n  of its net zero commitment and release of 2030      \n  emissions reductions targets for Energy and Power.  \n  The Proposal includes a similar but more general    \n  request related to the commitment that Citi has     \n  already made, but does not reflect the level of     \n  quantitative and science-based analysis necessary   \n  to manage these loan portfolios to net zero         \n  emissions. Therefore, the Board recommends a vote   \n  AGAINST this Proposal 8.                            \n                                                      \nProposal 9 National Center for Public Policy Research has\nsubmitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2022\nAnnual Meeting. Civil Rights and Non-Discrimination Audit\nProposal Resolved: Shareholders of Citigroup Inc. (\u201cthe\nCompany\u201d) request that the Board of Directors commission a non-\ndiscrimination audit, together with or independent of an already\nannounced racial-equity audit, 1analyzing the Company\u2019s impacts\non civil rights and non-discrimination for all Americans, and\nthe impacts of those issues on the Company\u2019s business. The audit\nmay, in the Board\u2019s discretion, be conducted by an independent\nand unbiased third party with input from civil-rights\norganizations, employees, communities in which the Company\noperates and other stakeholders, of all viewpoints and\nperspectives. A report on the audit, prepared at reasonable cost\nand omitting confidential or proprietary information, should be\npublicly disclosed on the Company\u2019s website. Citi 2022 Proxy\nStatement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  127  \n                              \nSupporting Statement: Tremendous public attention has focused on\nworkplace and employment practices. All agree that employee\nsuccess should be fostered and that no employees should face\ndiscrimination, but there is much disagreement about what non-\ndiscrimination means. Concern stretches across the ideological\nspectrum. Some have pressured companies to adopt \u201canti-racism\u201d\nprograms that seek to establish \u201cracial equity,\u201d which appears\nto mean the distribution of pay and authority on the basis of\nrace, sex, orientation and ethnic categories rather than by\nmerit. 2Where adopted, however, such programs raise significant\nobjection, including concern that the \u201canti-racist\u201d programs are\nthemselves deeply racist and otherwise discriminatory. 3 Many\ncompanies have been found to be sponsoring and promoting overtly\nand implicitly discriminatory employee-training and other\nemployment and advancement programs, including Bank of America,\nAmerican Express, Verizon, Pfizer and CVS. 4Citigroup\u2019s recent\ncommitment to \u201canti-racism\u201d presents similar concerns. This\ndisagreement and controversy creates massive reputational, legal\nand financial risk. If the Company is, in the name of equity,\ndiversity and inclusion, committing illegal discrimination\nagainst employees deemed \u201cnon-diverse,\u201d then the Company will\nsuffer in myriad ways \u2013 all of them both unforgivable and\navoidable. In developing the audit and report, the Company\nshould consult civil-rights groups \u2013 but it must not compound\nerror with bias by relying only on left-leaning civil-rights\ngroups. Rather, it must consult groups across the viewpoint\nspectrum. This includes right-leaning civil rights groups\nrepresenting people of color, such as the Woodson Center 5and\nProject 21, 6and groups that defend the civil rights and\nliberties of all Americans, not merely the ones that many\ncompanies label \u201cdiverse.\u201d All Americans have civil rights; to\nbehave otherwise invites disaster. Similarly, when including\nemployees in its audit, the Company must allow employees to\nspeak freely without fear of reprisal or disfavor, and in\nconfidential ways. Too many employers have initiated\ndiscriminatory programming that itself chills contributions from\nemployees who disagree with the premises of the programming, and\nthen have pretended that the employees who have been empowered\nto express themselves by the programming represent the true and\nonly voice of all employees. This by itself creates a deeply\nhostile workplace for some groups of employees, and is both\nimmoral and likely illegal.\n                                                                \n  1  https://blog.citigroup.com/2021/10/citi-will-conduct-a-r\u2026  \n     https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048911/00012067\u2026  \n     def14a.htm#StockholderProposals88;                         \n     https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/\u2026  \n  2  https://www.sec.                                           \n     gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2021/nyscrfamazo\u2026  \n     https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/                        \n     data/1666700/000119312521079533/d108785ddef14a.htm#rom1    \n     08785_58                                                   \n     https://www.americanexperiment.org/survey-says-americans\u2026  \n     https://www.newsweek.com/                                  \n     majority-americans-hold-negative-view-critical-race-theo\u2026  \n  3  https://www.newsweek.com/coca-cola-facing-backlash-says-\u2026  \n     https://nypost.com/2021/08/11/                             \n     american-express-tells-its-workers-capitalism-is-racist/;  \n     https://www.city-journal.org/verizon-critical-race-theor\u2026  \n     https://www.city-journal.org/bank-of-america-racial-reed\u2026  \n     https://www.city-journal.org/verizon-critical-race-theor\u2026  \n  4  https://nypost.com/2021/08/11/american-express-tells-its\u2026  \n     https://www.                                               \n     foxbusiness.com/politics/cvs-inclusion-training-critical\u2026  \n     https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/pfizer-sets-race-b\u2026  \n  5  https://woodsoncenter.org/                                 \n  6  https://nationalcenter.org/project-21/                     \n                                                                \nManagement Comment Summary The Proposal requests that \u201cthe Board\nof Directors commission a non-discrimination audit, together\nwith or independent of an already announced racial equity audit,\nanalyzing the Company\u2019s impacts on civil rights and non-\ndiscrimination for all Americans, and the impacts of those\nissues on the Company\u2019s business.\u201d The Supporting Statement\nexpresses a concern that anti-racism programs are themselves\ndeeply racist, and states that Citi\u2019s commitment to anti-racism\npresents concerns that Citi is \u201csponsoring and promoting overtly\ndiscriminatory and implicitly discriminatory employee-training\nand other employment and advancement programs\u201d against what it\nterms \u201cnon-diverse\u201d employees. www.citigroup.com Table of\nContents\n                              \n  128  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                              \nCiti disagrees with the proponent\u2019s fundamental concern that\nanti-racist programs are themselves deeply racist. Citi has a\nlong-standing commitment to equal employment opportunities for\nall employees. This commitment applies to all aspects of\nemployment, as well as to hiring, training, and other programs.\nCiti prohibits discrimination based on any employee\u2019s race, as\nwell as numerous other personal characteristics, as outlined in\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct. Citi\u2019s global workforce represents a\nwide range of backgrounds, perspectives and experience.\nDiversity and inclusion, as well as hiring and advancing\nemployees based on merit, are all core values to us; we do not\nview them as being in conflict with each other. Around the\nworld, we strive to be a company where the best people \u2013 from\nevery background \u2013 want to work, and where opportunities to\ndevelop are widely available. These values are reflected in\nexisting publicly disclosed reports and disclosures, including\nCiti\u2019s annual Talent & Diversity Report, annual Environmental\nSocial and Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) Report, Statement on Human Rights,\nCode of Conduct, and other employment policies and trainings,\nwhich are periodically reviewed. Important Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     Adoption of the Proposal would not be in the best          \n     interests of Citi\u2019s stockholders because the audit         \n     requested is unnecessary and duplicative in light of       \n     Citi\u2019s periodic review and updating of its policies and    \n     trainings, which prohibit discrimination against           \n  \u27a2  employees on the basis of any protected class. Citi also   \n     already regularly analyzes workforce demographics in a     \n     number of ways, including in hiring, employee engagement,  \n     and workforce representation, and publishes, in the U.S.,  \n     its U.S. workforce representation by gender and            \n     race/ethnic origin. Thus, Citi already addresses the core  \n     concerns of the Proposal.                                  \n     Citi\u2019s commitment to non-discrimination extends to all     \n     employees, clients, customers, and stakeholders. Citi has  \n     demonstrated its ongoing commitment to social justice and  \n     racial equity in its operations, business dealings, and    \n     engagement with stakeholders, customers, and employees.    \n     In that regard, The Proposal states that the requested     \n  \u27a2  audit could be conducted \u201ctogether with\u201d or \u201cindependent   \n     of\u201d the ongoing audit of Citi\u2019s Action for Racial Equity   \n     (\u201cARE\u201d). ARE is a set of strategic initiatives launched    \n     in September 2020 to help close the racial wealth gap in   \n     the U.S.; the scope and objective of the audit of that     \n     work, which is designed to further equality, is different  \n     from that described in the Proposal.                       \n                                                                \n                                                      \n  Citi believes that the stockholder Proposal is not  \n  necessary in light of the Citi\u2019s ongoing work,      \n  policies, and training supporting equal employment  \n  opportunities for all employees; therefore, the     \n  Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal 9.    \n                                                      \nCiti 2022 Proxy Statement Table of Contents\n                              \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  129  \n                              \nSubmission of Future Stockholder Proposals Under SEC Rule 14a-8,\na stockholder who intends to present a proposal at the next\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders and who wishes the proposal to be\nincluded in the Proxy Statement for that meeting must submit the\nproposal in writing to the Corporate Secretary of Citi at 388\nGreenwich Street, New York, New York 10013 and send to the\nfollowing email address: shareholderrelations@citi.com.\nProposals for the 2023 Annual Meeting must be received no later\nthan November 15, 2022. The proposal and its proponent must\nsatisfy all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8. Citi\u2019s By-\nlaws permit a stockholder or group of stockholders (up to 20)\nwho have owned at least 3% of Citi common stock for at least\nthree years to submit Director nominees (up to the greater of\ntwo nominees or 20% of the Board, as determined in accordance\nwith the By-laws) for inclusion in Citi\u2019s Proxy Statement if the\nnominating stockholder(s) satisfies the requirements specified\nin the By-laws. With respect to stockholder nominees for\nDirector election submitted for inclusion in Citi\u2019s Proxy\nStatement for the 2023 Annual Meeting, written notice of\nnominations must be provided by the stockholder proponent(s) to\nCiti in accordance with Citi\u2019s By-laws. The notice must be\ndelivered to, or mailed and received by, Citi\u2019s Corporate\nSecretary between October 16, 2022 and November 15, 2022. These\ndeadlines are based on the 150th day and 120th day,\nrespectively, before the one-year anniversary of the date that\nthe Proxy Statement for this Annual Meeting was first sent to\nstockholders (which date, for purposes of Citi\u2019s By-laws, is\nMarch 15, 2022). The ability to include a nominee in Citi\u2019s\nProxy Statement is subject to the terms and conditions set forth\nin Citi\u2019s By-laws. With respect to stockholder nominees for\nDirector election at the next Annual Meeting (other than\nnominees submitted for inclusion in Citi\u2019s proxy materials) and\nstockholder proposals for consideration at the next Annual\nMeeting that are not submitted for inclusion in Citi\u2019s proxy\nmaterials under Rule 14a-8, written notice of nominations and\nproposals must be provided by the stockholder proponent to Citi\nin accordance with Citi\u2019s By-laws. The notice must be delivered\nto, or mailed and received by, Citi\u2019s Corporate Secretary,\nbetween December 27, 2022 and January 26, 2023 and must comply\nwith all applicable provisions of Citi\u2019s By-laws. You may obtain\na copy of Citi\u2019s Bylaws on Citi\u2019s website or by writing to Brent\nJ. McIntosh, Corporate Secretary, at 388 Greenwich Street, New\nYork, New York 10013 or to the following email address:\nshareholderrelations.citi.com. In addition to the notice and\ninformation requirements contained in Citi's By-laws, to comply\nwith the universal proxy rules, stockholders who intend to\nsolicit proxies in support of director nominees other than\nCiti's nominees must provide notice that sets forth the\ninformation required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no\nlater than February 25, 2023. Cost of Annual Meeting and Proxy\nSolicitation Citi pays the cost of the Annual Meeting and the\ncost of soliciting proxies. In addition to soliciting proxies by\nmail, Citi may solicit proxies by personal interview, telephone,\nand similar means. No Director, officer, or employee of Citi\nwill be specially compensated for these activities. Citi also\nintends to request that brokers, banks, and other nominees\nsolicit proxies from their principals and will pay the brokers,\nbanks, and other nominees certain expenses they incur for such\nactivities. Citi has retained Morrow Sodali LLC, 333 Ludlow\nStreet, 5th Floor, South Tower, Stamford, CT 06902, a proxy\nsoliciting firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies, for\nan estimated fee of $30,000 plus reimbursement of certain out-\nof-pocket expenses. Householding Under SEC rules, a single set\nof Annual Reports and Proxy Statements may be sent to any\nhousehold at which two or more stockholders reside if they\nappear to be members of the same family. Each stockholder\ncontinues to receive a separate proxy card. This procedure,\nreferred to as householding, reduces the volume of duplicate\ninformation stockholders receive and reduces mailing and\nprinting expenses. In accordance with a notice sent to certain\nstockholders who shared a single address, only one Annual Report\nand Proxy Statement will be sent to that address unless any\nstockholder at that address requested multiple sets of documents\nbe sent. However, if any stockholder who agreed to householding\nwishes to receive a separate Annual Report or Proxy Statement,\nhe or she may telephone toll-free 1-866-540-7095 or write to\nBroadridge Financial Services, Inc., Householding Department, 51\nMercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Stockholders sharing an\naddress who wish to receive a single set of reports may do so by\ncontacting their banks or brokers, if they are beneficial\nholders, or by contacting Broadridge at the address set forth\nabove, if they are record holders. www.citigroup.com Table of\nContents\n       \n  130  \n       \nAbout the 2022 Annual Meeting\n                                                                \n  Q:  Who is soliciting my vote?                                \n      The Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. is soliciting    \n  A:  your vote at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Citi\u2019s            \n      stockholders.                                             \n  Q:  Where and when will the 2022 Annual Meeting take place?   \n      The Annual Meeting is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m.     \n      E.T. on April 26, 2022 through a virtual meeting          \n      platform.

Citi\u2019s By-laws provide that in the    \n  event a Director nominee is not re-elected, such Director     \n  shall offer to resign from his or her position as a           \n  Director. Unless the Board decides to reject the offer or to  \n  postpone the effective date of the offer, the resignation     \n  shall become effective 60 days after the date of the          \n  election.                                                     \n  The result of the votes on an advisory vote on our 2021       \n  executive compensation is not binding on the Board, whether   \n  or not the resolution is passed under the voting standards    \n  described above.

If you are a registered   \n  A:  stockholder and would like your vote kept confidential,   \n      please check the appropriate box on the proxy card or     \n      follow the instructions when submitting your vote by      \n      telephone, mobile phone, QR Code or by the Internet. If   \n      you hold your shares in \u0093street name\u0094 or through an         \n      employee benefit plan or stock incentive plan, your vote  \n      already receives confidential treatment and you do not    \n      need to request confidential treatment in order to        \n      maintain the confidentiality of your vote.                \n      The confidential voting policy will not apply in the      \n      event of a proxy contest or other solicitation based on   \n      an opposition Proxy Statement and in certain other        \n      limited circumstances. For further details regarding      \n      this policy, please see the Corporate Governance          \n      Guidelines, available on Citi\u2019s website at                \n      www.citigroup.com.                                        \n  Q:  Could other matters be decided at the 2022 Annual         \n      Meeting?                                                  \n      We don\u0092t know of any matters that will be considered at    \n      the Annual Meeting other than those described             \n      above.

If any other matters arise at the   \n      Annual Meeting that are properly presented at the         \n      meeting, the proxies will be voted at the discretion of   \n      the proxy holders.                                        \n      What happens if the meeting is postponed or adjourned or  \n  Q:  encounters                                                \n      technical difficulties?                                   \n      Your proxy will still be good and may be voted at the     \n      postponed or adjourned meeting.

Banks may\nnot return capital to stockholders or take other capital actions\nunless the Federal Reserve Board indicates that it has \u201cno\nobjection\u201d to a bank\u2019s capital plan, including its requested\ncapital actions. Cumulative Earnings per Share for our\nPerformance Share Units is determined by adding the diluted\nearnings per share based on net income allocated to common\nstockholders from our quarterly earnings reports for the 12\nquarters of the applicable three-year performance period.\nEfficiency Ratio is total operating expenses divided by total\nrevenues (net of interest expense). This ratio generally\ncompares the cost of generating revenue to the amount of revenue\ngenerated. A lower cost is preferable to a higher cost in\ngenerating the same amount of revenue, and therefore a lower\nefficiency ratio is generally better than a higher one. This\nmetric encourages management to consider the costs of generating\nadditional revenue instead of simply maximizing revenue, and can\nbe used on a relative basis to identify which businesses are\nmanaged better than others. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is\nHigh-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) divided by Net Outflows. The\nLCR is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level\nof HQLA to meet liquidity needs under an acute three-day stress\nscenario. Operating Leverage represents the annual change in\n[(Revenues, net of Interest Expense in bps), less (the annual\nchange in Operating Expenses in bps)]. Return on Assets (ROA) is\nnet income divided by average assets as determined under U.S.\nGAAP. Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE) is net income for\na business or Citigroup (minus preferred dividends in the case\nof Citigroup) divided by average tangible common equity for the\nyear. Management views this metric as an appropriate indication\nof the long-term potential of Citi\u2019s operating businesses to\ndeliver long-term value to stockholders. Total Payout Ratio is\nthe sum of dividends paid to common shareholders plus common\nshare repurchases, divided by (Net Income, less preferred\ndividends). www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n

Award Agreements Each Award under the Plan shall be\nevidenced by an Award Agreement (as such may be amended from\ntime to time) that sets forth the terms, conditions,\nrestrictions, and limitations applicable to the Award,\nincluding, but not limited to, the provisions governing vesting,\nexercisability, payment, forfeiture, cancellation, and\ntermination of employment, all or some of which may be\nincorporated by reference into one or more other documents\ndelivered or otherwise made available to a Participant in\nconnection with an Award. The Committee need not require the\nformal execution or acceptance of such document by the\nParticipant, in which case acceptance of any benefit of the\nAward by the Participant shall constitute agreement by the\nParticipant to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and\nlimitations set forth in the Plan and the Award Agreement as\nwell as the administrative guidelines and practices of the\nCompany in effect from time to time. Any assertion by an\nEmployee that any term, condition, limitation, or restriction of\nthe Award as specified in the Award Agreement is invalid or not\nbinding on such Employee because of his or her non-acceptance of\nthe Award Agreement (or any portion thereof) shall be deemed a\nrefusal of the Award and the Employee shall cease to be a\nParticipant with respect to the Award, which shall be\nimmediately cancelled. Each Award Agreement shall provide for\nforfeiture or cancellation of unvested Awards if it is\ndetermined that a Participant engaged in Gross Misconduct on or\nprior to a vesting date. 13. Tax Withholding Participants shall\nbe solely responsible for any applicable taxes (including\nwithout limitation income, payroll, and excise taxes) and\npenalties, and any interest that accrues thereon, which they\nincur under applicable law in connection with the receipt,\nvesting, or exercise of any Award. The Company and its\nSubsidiaries shall have the right to require payment of, or may\ndeduct from any payment made under the Plan or otherwise to a\nParticipant, or may permit or require shares to be tendered or\nsold (including shares of Common Stock delivered or vested in\nconnection with an Award) in an amount sufficient to cover\nwithholding of, any federal, state, local, foreign, or other\ngovernmental taxes or charges required by law, or hypothetical\ntaxes required to be paid by a Participant pursuant\nwww.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                \n  148  ANNEX B  \n                \nto a tax-equalization policy for expatriate employees, and to\ntake such other action as may be necessary to satisfy any such\nwithholding or payment obligations. The value of any shares\nallowed to be withheld or tendered for tax withholding may not\nexceed the amount allowed consistent with fixed plan accounting\nin accordance with GAAP, to the extent applicable. To the extent\nthat a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to satisfy a\ntax withholding obligation of the Company may not be withheld\n(whether because the Award has not vested in full pursuant to\nits terms, administrative procedures in effect at such time,\napplicable accounting principles, or any other reason), it shall\nbe a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue shares\nof Common Stock upon the exercise of an Option or a SAR, or in\nsettlement of any vested Award, that a Participant pay to the\nCompany, on demand, such amount as may be requested by the\nCompany for the purpose of satisfying any actual tax withholding\n(or hypothetical tax) liability. If the amount is not timely\npaid to the Company in cash by such Participant, the Company may\ncancel the Award and refuse to issue such shares. 14. Repayment\nObligations and Right of Set-Off\n                                                                \n       If the Committee determines that all conditions to       \n       vesting and payment or distribution of an Award (or any  \n       portion thereof), or the vesting and exercisability of   \n       an Option or SAR (or any portion thereof), were not      \n       satisfied in full on the scheduled vesting date          \n       (including but not limited to, any Performance           \n       Condition), the Committee shall cancel such vesting and  \n       refuse to issue or distribute shares or cash and         \n       immediately terminate the Participant\u2019s rights with      \n       respect to such Award (or improperly vested portion      \n       thereof). If any such Award (or portion thereof) has     \n       already been paid, distributed, or exercised, the        \n       Participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to: (i) in  \n       the case of an improperly vested Stock Award, return     \n       the amount of any cash payment received in settlement    \n  (a)  of the Stock Award (or improperly vested portion         \n       thereof), or if settled in shares, the number of shares  \n       of Common Stock issued in settlement of the Stock Award  \n       (or improperly vested portion thereof), or make a cash   \n       payment in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of   \n       such shares on their vesting date, if greater than       \n       their Fair Market Value on the date they are due to be   \n       returned to the Company; or (ii) in the case of an       \n       improperly exercised Option or SAR, make a cash payment  \n       in an amount equal to the gain realized upon exercise    \n       of such Option or SAR (or improperly vested or           \n       exercised portion thereof), in each case, without        \n       reduction for any shares of Common Stock or cash         \n       withheld or paid to satisfy withholding tax or           \n       hypothetical tax obligations in connection with such     \n       Awards or any other obligation of the Participant.       \n       To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, and      \n       consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the  \n       Code, if applicable, the Company will have the right to  \n       offset against its obligation to deliver vested shares   \n       of Common Stock or make any vested cash payment          \n       pursuant to any Award granted under the Plan: (i) any    \n       amounts paid by the Company or a Subsidiary to a third   \n       party pursuant to any award, judgment, or settlement of  \n  (b)  a complaint, arbitration, or lawsuit of which a          \n       Participant was the subject; and (ii) any outstanding    \n       amounts (including, without limitation, travel and       \n       entertainment or advance account balances, loans,        \n       repayment obligations under any Awards granted under     \n       the Plan, or awards granted under any other plan, or     \n       any obligations pursuant to a tax-equalization or        \n       housing allowance policy or other expatriate benefit)    \n       that a Participant then owes to the Company or a         \n       Subsidiary.                                              \n                                                                \n15. Other Benefit and Compensation Programs Awards granted under\nthe Plan and amounts received upon vesting or exercise of an\nAward shall not be deemed a part of a Participant\u2019s regular,\nrecurring compensation for purposes of calculating payments or\nbenefits under any Company benefit plan or severance program\nunless specifically provided for under the plan or program.\nUnless specifically set forth in an Award Agreement, Awards\nunder the Plan are not intended as payment for compensation that\notherwise would have been delivered in cash, and even if so\nintended, such Awards shall be subject to such vesting\nrequirements and other terms, conditions, restrictions, and\nlimitations as may be provided in the Award Agreement.

Unfunded Plan Unless otherwise determined by the Committee,\nthe Plan shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed\nto create) a trust or a separate fund or funds. The Plan shall\nnot establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and\nany Participant or other person. To the extent that any\nParticipant holds any rights by virtue of an Award granted under\nthe Plan, such rights shall constitute general unsecured\nliabilities of the Company and shall not confer upon any\nParticipant or any other person or entity any right, title, or\ninterest in any assets of the Company. 17. Expenses of the Plan\nThe expenses of the administration of the Plan shall be borne by\nthe Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company may require\nSubsidiaries to pay for the Common Stock issued under the Plan\nto Participants employed (or formerly employed) by such\nSubsidiaries. 18. Rights as a Stockholder Unless the Committee\ndetermines otherwise, a Participant shall not have any rights as\na stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by\nan Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of\nrecord with respect to such shares. No adjustment will be made\nfor dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior\nto such date, except as provided in Section 6(d) or Section 8.\n19. Future Rights No Employee shall have any claim or right to\nbe granted an Award under the Plan. There shall be no obligation\nof uniformity of treatment of Employees under the Plan. Further,\nthe Company and its Subsidiaries may adopt other compensation\nprograms, plans, or arrangements as they deem appropriate or\nnecessary. The adoption of the Plan or the granting of any Award\nshall not confer upon any Employee any right to continued\nemployment in any particular position or at any particular rate\nof compensation, nor shall it interfere in any way with the\nright of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment\nof its Employees at any time, free from any claim or liability\nunder the Plan. Unless expressly provided otherwise elsewhere in\nthe Plan or in an Award Agreement, Awards under the Plan shall\nbe made in anticipation of future service and/or subject to\nother vesting conditions and will not be earned until all\nconditions to vesting have been satisfied. 20. Amendment and\nTermination The Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated at\nany time by the Committee, provided that no amendment shall be\nmade without stockholder approval, if it would (a) materially\nincrease the number of shares available under the Plan (other\nthan pursuant to Section 6(d)), (b) materially expand the types\nof awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the\nclass of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d)\nmaterially extend the term of the Plan, (e) materially change\nthe method of determining the exercise price of an Award, (f)\ndelete or limit the Plan\u2019s prohibition against Repricing, or (g)\notherwise require approval by the stockholders of the Company in\norder to comply with applicable law or the rules of the New York\nStock Exchange (or, if the Common Stock is not traded on the New\nYork Stock Exchange, the principal national securities exchange\nupon which the Common Stock is then traded or quoted). No such\namendment referred to above shall be effective unless and until\nit has been approved by the stockholders of the Company. The\nCommittee retains the right to modify an Award without a\nParticipant\u2019s prior consent if it determines that the\nmodification is required to comply with applicable law,\nregulation, or regulatory guidance (including applicable tax\nlaw). Except as may be provided by Section 7(e), Section 11, and\nthis Section 20, any other adverse modification shall not be\neffective without the Participant\u2019s written consent. The Company\nshall furnish or make available to Participants a written notice\nof any modification through a brochure, prospectus supplement,\nor otherwise, which notice shall specify the effective date of\nsuch modification. www.citigroup.com Table of Contents\n                \n  150  ANNEX B  \n                \n21. Successors and Assigns The Plan and any applicable Award\nAgreement entered into under the Plan shall be binding upon and\ninure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted\nassigns of Participants, including, without limitation, the\nexecutors, administrators, or trustees of a Participant\u2019s\nestate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or\nrepresentative of a Participant\u2019s creditors. 22. Governing Law\nThe Plan and all Award Agreements entered into under the Plan\nshall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws\nof the State of New York, except that any principles or\nprovisions of New York law that would apply the law of another\njurisdiction (other than applicable provisions of U.S. federal\nlaw) shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nmatters with respect to indemnification, delegation of authority\nunder the Plan, and the legality of shares of Common Stock\nissued under the Plan, shall be governed by the Delaware General\nCorporation Law. 23. Tax Compliance Awards granted hereunder\nshall comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code,\nunless otherwise determined by the Committee. If, pursuant to\nany Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, a\nParticipant is entitled to receive a payment on a specified\ndate, such payment shall be deemed made as of such specified\ndate if it is made (a) not earlier than 30 days before such\nspecified date, and (b) not later than December 31 of the year\nin which such specified date occurs or, if later, the fifteenth\nday of the third month following such specified date; provided\nthat the Participant shall not be permitted, directly or\nindirectly, to designate the taxable year in which such payment\nis made. If, pursuant to any Award that is subject to Section\n409A of the Code, a Participant is entitled to a series of\ninstallment payments, such Participant\u2019s right to the series of\ninstallment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of\nseparate payments and not as a right to a single payment. For\npurposes of the preceding sentence, the term \u201cseries of\ninstallment payments\u201d has the same meaning as provided in\nSection 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) of the regulations promulgated under\nthe Code. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the\ncontrary, in no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary be\nliable to a Participant on account of an Award\u2019s failure to (a)\nqualify for favorable U.S. or foreign tax treatment, or (b)\navoid adverse tax treatment under U.S. or foreign law,\nincluding, without limitation, Sections 409A and 457A of the\nCode. 24. Severability If any provision of this Plan is finally\nheld to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable (whether in whole\nor in part), such provision shall be deemed modified to the\nextent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality,\nor unenforceability, and the remaining provisions shall not be\naffected thereby; provided that, if any such provision is\nfinally held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable because it\nexceeds the maximum scope determined to be acceptable to permit\nsuch provision to be enforceable, such provision shall be deemed\nmodified to the minimum extent necessary in order to make such\nprovision enforceable.
