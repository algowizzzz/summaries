2022\u2014Strong\nResults and Continued Progress\nToward Achieving Priorities\n\nAs described further\nthroughout this Executive\nSummary, during the second\nquarter of 2022:\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s revenues increased\n11% versus the prior-year\nperiod, reflecting growth in\nnet interest income\u2014primarily\ndriven by benefits from higher\ninterest rates and strong\nvolumes in Institutional\nClients Group (ICG) and\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement (PBWM) , and growth\nin non-interest revenue\u2014driven\nby Fixed income markets and\nServices in ICG , partially\noffset by lower non-interest\nrevenue in ICG \u2019s Investment\nbanking business and PBWM .\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses increased\n8%, driven by continued\ninvestments in its\ntransformation, including\nenhancing its risk and control\nenvironment and modernizing\nits data and technology\ninfrastructure; and business-\nled investments, including\nhiring front office employees\nand enhancing product\ncapabilities and platforms\nthat improve the digital\nclient experience and add\nscalability.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned a total of\n$1.3 billion to common\nshareholders in the form of\ndividends and repurchases.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) Capital ratio increased\nto 11.9% as of June 30, 2022,\ncompared to 11.8% as of June\n30, 2021. As previously\ndisclosed, on October 1, 2022,\nCiti\u2019s effective minimum CET1\nCapital ratio will increase to\n11.5% from 10.5% under the\nStandardized Approach due to\nthe increase in the Stress\nCapital Buffer (SCB)\nrequirement to 4.0% from 3.0%.\nIn addition, on January 1,\n2023, Citi\u2019s effective minimum\nCET1 Capital requirement will\nincrease to 12% from 11.5%\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, as the GSIB\nsurcharge increases to 3.5%\nfrom 3.0% (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d below). Due to the\nincreases, Citi announced it\nis pausing common share\nrepurchases as it continues to\nbuild capital.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to make\nprogress on its divestitures\nin the current quarter,\nincluding completing the sale\nof its Australia consumer\nbusiness, which resulted in a\nregulatory capital benefit of\napproximately $1.4 billion,\nand making progress on closing\nthe other eight previously\nsigned consumer business\ntransactions and the wind-down\nof the Korea consumer\nbusiness. As previously\nannounced, Citi also completed\nthe sale of its Philippines\nconsumer business on August 1,\n2022, resulting in a\nregulatory capital benefit of\napproximately $700 million.\n\nVarious geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties continue to\nadversely impact economic\nconditions in the U.S. and\nglobally. The U.S. and other\ncountries have experienced\nsignificantly elevated levels\nof inflation, resulting in\ncentral banks implementing a\nseries of interest rates\nincreases, with additional\nincreases expected in\n\nthe near term. In addition to\nthe humanitarian crisis, the\nwar in Ukraine has caused\nsupply shocks in energy and\nfood markets.\n\nDisruptions in global supply\nchains have continued and the\nCOVID-19 pandemic continues to\nevolve. An economic rebound in\nChina faces constraints given\nthe potential for future\npandemic-related lockdowns,\nthe amount of leverage in its\neconomy and stress in the\nproperty sector. All of these\nfactors have caused a decline\nin financial markets,\nnegatively impacted economic\ngrowth rates, contributed to\nsharply lower consumer\nconfidence and increased the\noverall risk of recession in\nEurope, the U.S. and other\ncountries. These and other\nfactors could adversely affect\nCiti\u2019s customers, clients,\nbusinesses, funding costs and\nresults during the remainder\nof 2022.\n\nFor a further discussion of\ntrends, uncertainties and\nrisks that will or could\nimpact Citi\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations, capital\nand other financial condition\nduring the remainder of 2022,\nsee each respective business\u2019s\nresults of operations,\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d and\n\u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d\nbelow and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Second Quarter of 2022 Results Summary                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $4.5 billion, or $2.19 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $6.2 billion, or $2.85 per\nshare in the prior-year\nperiod. The decrease in net\nincome was largely driven by\nhigher cost of credit, as well\nas higher expenses, partially\noffset by the increase in\nrevenues. Citigroup\u2019s reported\neffective tax rate was 19.8%,\ncompared to the second quarter\nof 2021 effective tax rate of\n15.7%. The lower effective tax\nrate in the prior-year period\nreflected a $450 million\nvaluation allowance release\nrelated to foreign tax credit\ncarry-forwards, compared to a\nsignificantly lower release in\nthe current quarter. These\nreleases were due to revised\nprojections of future income\n(for additional information,\nsee \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d below).\nEarnings per share decreased\n23%, reflecting the decrease\nin net income, partially\noffset by a 6% decline in\naverage diluted shares\noutstanding.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $19.6\nbillion increased 11%,\nreflecting increased interest\nrates and volumes in ICG and\nPBWM , primarily from higher\nclient activity in Markets in\nICG and continued momentum in\nServices non-interest revenue,\npartially offset by a slowdown\nin Investment banking activity\nas well as investment fee\nheadwinds in Global Wealth\nManagement (Global Wealth) in\nPBWM.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $657 billion, down\n3% from the prior-year period,\nas growth in ICG and PBWM (up\n2% and 4%, respectively) was\nmore than offset by lower\nloans in Legacy Franchises.\nThe decline in Legacy\nFranchises primarily reflected\nthe reclassification of loans\nto Other assets to reflect\nheld-for-sale (HFS) accounting\nas a result of the signing of\nsale agreements for consumer\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA.\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits increased 1%\n                               3                                \nto $1.3 trillion, largely\ndriven by growth in Treasury\nand trade solutions (TTS) in\nICG and Global Wealth.\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s operating expenses\nof $12.4 billion increased 8%,\ndriven by continued\ninvestments in its\ntransformation, higher\nbusiness-led investments and\nvolume-related expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings. As\npreviously announced, Citi\nexpects to continue to incur\nhigher expenses during the\nremainder of 2022, compared to\nthe prior-year period,\nreflecting ongoing\ntransformation-related and\nbusiness-led investments.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $1.3\nbillion, compared to a benefit\nof $1.1 billion in the prior-\nyear period. The higher cost\nof credit was driven by an\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL) build of approximately\n$400 million (compared to a\nnet release of $2.4 billion in\nthe prior-year period),\npartially offset by lower net\ncredit losses.\n\nThe net ACL build primarily\nrelated to increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty,\npartially offset by a release\nrelated to a reduction in\nRussia-related risk in ICG in\nthe quarter. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Citi\u2019s Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $0.9\nbillion decreased 36%.\nConsumer net credit losses\ndecreased 33% to $827 million,\nlargely reflecting improved\ndelinquencies in Legacy\nFranchises and certain PBWM\nbusinesses. Specifically, the\ndecline reflected lower net\ncredit losses in Legacy\nFranchises (down 66%),\nprimarily reflecting improved\ndelinquencies and the\nreclassification of loans to\nreflect HFS accounting as a\nresult of the signing of sales\nagreements for consumer\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA.\nThe decline was also driven by\nlower net credit losses in\nboth Branded cards (down 30%\nto $329 million) and Retail\nservices (down 11% to $290\nmillion) in PBWM , driven by\ncontinued strong credit\nperformance across portfolios.\nCorporate net credit losses\ndecreased 70% to $23 million,\ndriven by improvements in\nportfolio credit quality.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 11.9% as of June 30, 2022,\ncompared to 11.8% as of June\n30, 2021, based on the Basel\nIII Standardized Approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets. The increase was\ndriven primarily by net\nincome, a decrease in risk-\nweighted assets and the impact\nrelated to the closing of the\nAustralia consumer banking\nsale, partially offset by\ninterest rate-related adverse\nnet movements in the\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (AOCI)\ncomponent of equity, and the\nreturn of capital to common\nshareholders. The increase in\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio was\nalso partially offset by the\nimpact of adopting the\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk (SA-\nCCR) on January\n\n1, 2022. For additional\ninformation on SA-CCR, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d in Citi\u2019s\nFirst Quarter of 2022 Form\n10-Q.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of June 30,\n2022 was 5.6%, compared to\n5.8% as of June 30, 2021. The\ndecrease was driven by the\nincrease in Total Leverage\nExposure and the decrease in\nTier 1 Capital. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s capital\nratios and related components,\nsee \u201cCapital Resources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Institutional Clients Group                                   \n                                                                \nICG net income of $4.0 billion\nincreased 16%, driven by\nhigher revenues, partially\noffset by higher expenses and\nhigher cost of credit. ICG\noperating expenses of $6.4\nbillion increased 10%, driven\nby continued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation, higher\nbusiness-led investments and\nvolume-related expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nICG revenues of $11.4 billion\nincreased 20% (including gains\n(losses) on loan hedges),\ndriven by growth in Services\nand Markets revenues,\npartially offset by a decrease\nin Investment banking\nrevenues. Results included a\ngain on loan hedges of $0.5\nbillion, compared with a loss\non loan hedges of $37 million\nin the prior-year period.\n\nServices revenues of $4.0\nbillion increased 28%. TTS\nrevenues of $3.0 billion\nincreased 33%, driven by 42%\ngrowth in net interest income,\nas well as 17% growth in non-\ninterest revenue, reflecting\nstrength with both mid-size\nand large corporate clients.\nSecurities services revenues\nof $994 million increased 16%,\nas net interest income grew\n41%, driven by higher interest\nrates across currencies, and\nnon-interest revenue grew 8%,\nreflecting elevated levels of\ncorporate settlement activity\nin Issuer services.\n\nMarkets revenues of $5.3\nbillion were up 25%, driven by\nelevated volatility leading to\nhigher client activity. Fixed\nincome markets revenues of\n$4.1 billion increased 31%,\nprimarily reflecting strong\nclient engagement in the\nrates, currencies and\ncommodities businesses. Equity\nmarkets revenues of $1.2\nbillion were up 8%, driven by\nstrong equity derivatives\nperformance, partially offset\nby less client activity in\ncash, and a net decrease in\nprime balances, as lower asset\nvaluations more than offset\nnew client balances.\n\nBanking revenues of $2.1\nbillion decreased 4%.\nExcluding the gains (losses)\non loan hedges, Banking\nrevenues of $1.6 billion\ndecreased 28%. Investment\nbanking revenues of $805\nmillion declined 46%, as\nheightened geopolitical\nuncertainty and the overall\nmacroeconomic backdrop reduced\ncapital markets activity and\nM&A. The decline in Investment\nbanking revenues was partially\noffset by higher revenues in\nCorporate lending.

PBWM operating\nexpenses of $4.0 billion\nincreased 12%, driven by\ncontinued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation, higher\nbusiness-led investments and\nvolume-related expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n                               4                                \nPBWM revenues of $6.0 billion\nincreased 6%, as net interest\nincome growth was partially\noffset by a decline in non-\ninterest revenue, largely\ndriven by higher partner\npayments in Retail services.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nof $4.1 billion increased 9%.\nBranded cards revenues of $2.2\nbillion increased 10%, driven\nby higher interest income on\nhigher loan balances. New\naccounts and card spend volume\neach increased 18%, while\naverage loans increased 11%.\nRetail services revenues of\n$1.3 billion increased 7%,\ndriven by higher interest\nincome on higher loan\nbalances, partially offset by\nthe higher partner payments.\nRetail banking revenues of\n$656 million increased 6%,\nlargely driven by higher\ndeposit spreads and volumes.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues of $1.9\nbillion were largely\nunchanged, as investment fee\nheadwinds, particularly in\nAsia, were offset by an\nincrease in revenues driven by\ngrowth in average deposits and\naverage loans.

Legacy Franchises\nexpenses increased 1%, driven\nby impairment of long-lived\nassets related to the Russia\nconsumer banking business (see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d\nbelow) and higher marketing\nexpenses in Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM, partially\noffset by lower expenses\nrelated to the Asia Consumer\nexit markets.\n\nLegacy Franchises revenues of\n$1.9 billion decreased 15%,\nlargely driven by the impacts\nof the Korea wind-down and the\nclosing of the Australia\nconsumer banking sale, as well\nas lower investment activity\nin Asia Consumer. The decline\nin revenues was also driven by\na portion of the release of a\ncurrency translation\nadjustment (CTA) loss (net of\nhedges) from AOCI related to\nthe substantial liquidation of\na legacy U.K. consumer\noperation (for additional\ninformation, see Note 2). In\naddition, another portion of\nthe CTA loss release was\nreported in discontinued\noperations in Corporate/Other\n.

As\ndiscussed above, the other\nportion of the CTA loss was\nrecorded in revenues in Legacy\nFranchises . The decline in\nnet income was partially\noffset by lower expenses and\nmodestly higher revenues.\nCorporate/Other expenses of\n$160 million decreased 48%,\ndriven by certain settlements\nand the benefit of foreign\ncurrency translation into U.S.\ndollars for reporting purposes\n(FX translation).\n\nCorporate/Other revenues of\n$255 million increased 12%,\nlargely driven by higher net\nrevenues from the investment\nportfolio, reflecting higher\ninterest rates.

Markets business performance on a total\nrevenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items.\nFor example, securities that generate Net interest income may be\nrisk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a\ndescription of the composition of these revenue line items, see\nNotes 4, 5 and 6.\n\n(2) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion\nof the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans\nand loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include\nthe mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-\nmarket on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The\nfixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the\ncorporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit\nprotection. Citigroup\u2019s results of operations excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n                               11                               \nThe discussion of the results of operations for ICG below\nexcludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of\naccrual loans and loans at fair value, which are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. For a reconciliation of these metrics to the\nreported results, see the table above.\n                                                                \n  2Q22 vs. 2Q21                                                 \n                                                                \nNet income of $4.0 billion\nincreased 16%, primarily\ndriven by higher revenues,\npartially offset by higher\nexpenses and higher cost of\ncredit.\n\nRevenues increased 20%\n(including gain (loss) on loan\nhedges), primarily reflecting\nhigher Services and Markets\nrevenues, partially offset by\nlower Banking revenues.\nServices revenues were up 28%,\ndriven by higher revenues in\nboth TTS and Securities\nservices. Markets revenues\nwere up 25%, reflecting higher\nrevenues in both Fixed income\nmarkets and Equity markets,\nboth driven by elevated\nvolatility leading to higher\nclient engagement. Banking\nrevenues were down 4%\n(including the impact of gains\n(losses) on loan hedges).\nExcluding the impact of gains\n(losses) on loan hedges,\nrevenues declined 28%, largely\nreflecting lower revenues in\nInvestment banking, partially\noffset by higher Corporate\nlending revenues.\n\nCiti expects that Investment\nbanking revenues will likely\ncontinue to reflect lower\nlevels of capital markets and\nM&A activity during the\nremainder of 2022.\n\nWithin Services:\n\n\u2022 TTS revenues increased 33%,\ndriven by 42% growth in net\ninterest income and 17% growth\nin non-interest revenue,\nreflecting strong growth with\nboth mid-size and large\ncorporate clients. The\nincrease in net interest\nincome was driven by both the\ncash and trade businesses,\nreflecting benefits from\nrates, higher average deposits\n(2% increase) and higher\naverage loans (17% increase).\nThe increase in average loans\nwas driven by the trade\nbusiness, reflecting strength\nin trade flows, primarily in\nAsia, Latin America and EMEA,\npartially offset by asset\nsales in North America. The\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue was primarily due to\nstrong fee growth across both\nthe cash and trade businesses,\nreflecting solid client\nengagement, including higher\ntransaction volumes, as cross-\nborder flows increased 17%,\ncommercial cards volumes\nincreased 61% and U.S. dollar\nclearing volumes increased 2%.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 16%, as net interest\nincome grew 41%, driven by\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies. Non-interest\nrevenues grew 8%, largely\nreflecting elevated levels of\ncorporate activity in Issuer\nservices. The increase in non-\ninterest revenues was\npartially offset by a decline\nin fees in the custody\nbusiness, due to lower assets\nunder custody (7% decrease),\ndriven by declines in global\nfinancial markets.\n\nWithin Markets:\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 31%, with\ngrowth across all regions, due\nto strong client engagement,\nparticularly with corporate\nclients.\n\nRates and currencies increased\n66%, driven by increased\nmarket volatility largely\nresulting from increased\ninterest rates by central\nbanks in response to elevated\nlevels of inflation. Spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome\n\nrevenues decreased 29%,\nreflecting lower client\nactivity in spread products\nand a challenging environment\ndue to widening spreads. The\ndecline in spread products and\nother fixed income revenues\nwas partially offset by\nstrength in commodities,\nparticularly with corporate\nclients, as the business\nassisted the clients in\nmanaging risk associated with\nthe increased volatility.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 8%, primarily driven\nby equity derivatives,\nreflecting strong client\nengagement with both corporate\nand institutional clients,\npartially offset by lower\nclient activity in cash and a\nnet decrease in prime\nbalances, as lower asset\nvaluations more than offset\nnew client balances.\n\nWithin Banking:\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\ndeclined 46%, reflecting a\ndecline in the overall market\nwallet, as continued\nheightened geopolitical\nuncertainty and the overall\nmacroeconomic backdrop reduced\nactivity. Advisory revenues\ndecreased 12%, reflecting a\ndecline in EMEA and Asia,\ndriven by the decline in the\nmarket wallet and a decline in\nwallet share. Equity\nunderwriting revenues\ndecreased 63%, reflecting a\ndecline in North America, EMEA\nand Asia, driven by a decline\nin the market wallet across\nall products, partially offset\nby wallet share gains. Debt\nunderwriting revenues\ndecreased 56%, reflecting\nweakness in North America and\nEMEA, driven by the decline in\nthe market wallet as well as a\ndecline in wallet share in\nnon-investment grade,\npartially offset by an\nincrease in wallet share in\ninvestment grade. The decline\nin debt underwriting revenues\nalso reflected markdowns on\nthe leveraged finance\nportfolio.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nwere $1.3 billion versus $651\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, including the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges. Excluding the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges, revenues increased\n13%, primarily driven by the\nimpacts of foreign currency\nand improved spreads.\n\nExpenses were up 10%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and higher volume-\nrelated expenses, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions were a benefit of\n$202 million, compared to a\nbenefit of $694 million in the\nprior-year period.\n\nNet credit losses declined to\n$18 million from $68 million\nin the prior-year period,\ndriven by improvements in\nportfolio credit quality.\n\nThe ACL release was $220\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $762 million in the prior-\nyear period. The ACL release\nwas largely driven by a\nreduction in Russia-related\nrisk, partially offset by a\nbuild due to increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.

Net\ncredit losses declined to $48\nmillion from $243 million in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby improvements in portfolio\ncredit quality. The ACL build\nwas $721 million, compared to\na release of $2.5 billion in\nthe prior-year period. The ACL\nbuild primarily related to\nCiti\u2019s exposures in Russia and\nthe broader impact of the war\nin Ukraine on the\nmacroeconomic environment in\nthe first quarter of 2022, as\nwell as a build due to\nincreased macroeconomic\nuncertainty in the current\nquarter, partially offset by a\nreduction in Russia-related\nexposure in the current\nquarter.\n                               13                               \n                                                                \n  PERSONAL BANKING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT                        \n                                                                \nPersonal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) consists of U.S.\nPersonal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth).\nU.S. Personal Banking includes Retail banking, which provides\ntraditional banking services to retail and small business\ncustomers.

9%.\nBranded cards revenues\nincreased 10%, driven by\nhigher interest on higher loan\nbalances. Branded cards new\naccounts and spend volume both\nincreased 18%, while average\nloans increased 11%,\nreflecting higher card spend\nvolume, investments to drive\ngrowth and the realization of\nbenefits from a market re-\nentry beginning in the second\nhalf of 2021.\n\nRetail services revenues\nincreased 7%, driven by higher\ninterest on higher loan\nbalances, partially offset by\nthe higher partner payments,\nreflecting higher income\nsharing as a result of higher\nrevenues and lower net credit\nlosses (for additional\ninformation on partner\npayments, see Note 5). Retail\nservices card spend volume\nincreased 11%, while average\nloans increased 6%, reflecting\nincreased customer spending.\n\nRetail banking revenues\nincreased 6%, largely driven\nby higher deposit spreads and\nvolumes. Average deposits\nincreased 3%, reflecting\nhigher levels of consumer\nliquidity.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues were\nlargely unchanged, reflecting\ninvestment fee headwinds,\nparticularly in Asia, driven\nby overall market volatility,\noffset by an increase in\nrevenues driven by growth in\naverage deposits (up 7%) and\naverage loans (up 2%). Client\nassets decreased 8%, driven\nprincipally by declines in\nmarket valuation. Global\nWealth also continued to add\nclient advisors, which\nincreased 8%. Citigold\nrevenues increased 1%, while\nPrivate bank revenues were\nlargely unchanged and Wealth\nat Work revenues decreased 1%.\n\nExpenses increased 12%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation and higher\nbusiness-led investments and\nvolume-driven expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nProvisions were $1.4 billion,\ncompared to a benefit of $170\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by a\nnet ACL build, partially\noffset by lower net credit\nlosses. Net credit losses\ndecreased 19%, reflecting\nlower net credit losses in\nboth Branded cards (down 30%\nto $329 million) and Retail\nservices (down 11% to $290\nmillion), driven by continued\nstrong credit performance\nacross portfolios.\n\nThe net ACL build was $651\nmillion, compared to a net\nrelease of $1.0 billion in the\nprior-year period. The net ACL\nbuild primarily reflected\nincreased macroeconomic\nuncertainty.

U.S.\nPersonal Banking revenues\nincreased 3%, reflecting\nhigher revenues in Cards,\nlargely driven by the same\nfactors described above.\nGlobal Wealth revenues\ndecreased 1%, largely driven\nby investment fee headwinds,\nparticularly in Asia.\n\nExpenses increased 13%, driven\nby the same factors described\nabove.\n\nProvisions were $979 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $727\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by a lower ACL\nrelease, partially offset by\nlower net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses decreased 25%,\ndriven by the same factors\ndescribed above. The net ACL\nrelease was $413 million,\ncompared to a release of $2.6\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The net ACL release\nprimarily reflected\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality and the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook in the\nfirst quarter of 2022,\npartially offset by the net\nACL build in the current\nquarter due to the increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.\n                               15                               \n                                                                \n  LEGACY FRANCHISES                                             \n                                                                \nAs of June 30, 2022, Legacy Franchises included Asia Consumer\nBanking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer banking\noperations of the remaining 12 Asia and EMEA exit countries (and\nAustralia until its sale closing on June 1, 2022); Mexico\nConsumer Banking (Mexico Consumer) and Mexico Small Business and\nMiddle-Market Banking (Mexico SBMM), collectively Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM, which Citi also plans to exit; and Legacy\nHoldings Assets (certain North America consumer mortgage loans\nand other legacy assets).\n\nAsia Consumer provides traditional retail banking and branded\ncard products to retail and small business customers. Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM provides traditional retail banking and branded\ncard products to consumers and small business customers and\nprovides traditional middle-market banking products and services\nto commercial customers through Citibanamex.\n\nAs previously disclosed, Citi entered into an agreement to sell\nits consumer banking business in Australia (which was completed\non June 1, 2022) and made a decision to wind down and close its\nKorea consumer banking business (see Note 2 for additional\ninformation). In addition, on August 1, 2022, Citi completed the\nsale of its Philippines consumer business. Citi has also entered\ninto agreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in\nBahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and\nVietnam.\n\nAt June 30, 2022, on a combined basis, the Legacy Franchises\nbusiness had 1,457 retail branches, $26 billion in retail\nbanking loans and $53 billion in deposits. In addition, the\nbusinesses had $8 billion in outstanding card loan balances, and\nMexico SBMM had $7 billion in outstanding corporate loan\nbalances. These amounts exclude approximately $19 billion of\nloans ($13 billion of retail banking loans and $6 billion of\ncredit card loan balances) and $22 billion of deposits, all of\nwhich were reclassified to Other assets and Other liabilities\nheld-for-sale (HFS) as a result of Citi\u2019s agreements to sell its\nconsumer banking businesses in the above listed countries.

Consumer and\nLegacy Holdings Assets, while\nMexico Consumer/SBMM was\nlargely unchanged.\n\nAsia Consumer revenues\ndecreased 16%, largely\nresulting from impacts related\nto the Korea wind-down,\ncompletion of the Australia\nconsumer banking sale and\nlower investments revenues due\nto muted investment activity\nin Asia, reflecting overall\nmarket volatility.\n\nMexico Consumer/SBMM revenues\nwere largely unchanged, as\ncards revenues increased 1%,\ndue to higher rates and\nlending volumes, resulting\nfrom higher card spend\nvolumes, while retail banking\nand SBMM revenues were largely\nunchanged.\n\nLegacy Holdings Assets\nrevenues of $(129) million\ndecreased from $43 million in\nthe prior-year period, largely\ndriven by a portion of the\nrelease of a CTA loss (net of\nhedges) recorded in AOCI\nrelated to the substantial\nliquidation of a legacy U.K.\nconsumer operation (for\nadditional information, see\nNote 2). The other portion of\nthe CTA loss release was\nrecorded in discontinued\noperations in Corporate/Other\nin the current quarter.\n\nExpenses increased 1%, driven\nby impairment of long-lived\nassets related to the Russia\nconsumer banking business (see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d\nbelow) and higher marketing\nexpenses in Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM, partially\noffset by lower expenses\nrelated to the Asia Consumer\nexit markets.\n\nProvisions were $121 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $204\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by a lower net\nACL release, partially offset\nby lower net credit losses.\nNet credit losses decreased\n66%, primarily reflecting\nimproved delinquencies in both\nMexico Consumer and Asia\nConsumer and the\nreclassification of loans to\nreflect HFS accounting as a\nresult of the signing of sales\nagreements for consumer\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA.\n\nThe net ACL release was $31\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $602 million in the prior-\nyear period. The net ACL\nrelease in the current quarter\nprimarily reflected an\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality.

The net loss was $400\nmillion, compared to net\nincome of $817 million in the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by lower revenues,\nhigher expenses and higher\ncost of credit.\n\nResults for the first half of\n2022 included aggregate Asia\nConsumer divestiture-related\nimpacts of approximately $629\nmillion (pretax), including a\ngoodwill write-down of $535\nmillion, recorded in expenses,\ndue to the re-segmentation and\ntiming of divestitures; and\nincremental losses on sale\nrecorded in revenues of\napproximately $(98) million\nfrom the sale of the Australia\nconsumer banking business.\n\nRevenues decreased 15%,\nreflecting lower revenues in\nAsia Consumer and Legacy\nHoldings Assets, while Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM was largely\nunchanged.\n\nAsia Consumer revenues\ndecreased 22%, driven by the\nsame factors described above,\nas well as the revenue impact\nin the first half of 2022\nrelated to the sale of the\nAustralia consumer banking\nbusiness. Legacy Holdings\nAssets revenues of $(124)\nmillion decreased from $74\nmillion, largely driven by the\nCTA loss (net of hedges).\n\nExpenses increased 16%,\nprimarily driven by the first\nquarter goodwill write-down\nand the long-lived assets\nimpairment, partially offset\nby lower expenses related to\nthe Asia Consumer exit\nmarkets.\n\nProvisions were $281 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $160\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by a lower net\nACL release, partially offset\nby lower net credit losses.\nThe net ACL release was $53\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $1.2 billion in the prior-\nyear period.

The decline in net income\nwas partially offset by lower\nexpenses and modestly higher\nrevenues.\n\nRevenues increased 12%,\nprimarily driven by higher net\nrevenue from the investment\nportfolio, largely due to\nhigher interest rates.\n\nExpenses decreased 48%, driven\nby certain settlements and the\nbenefit of FX translation in\nthe current period.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to\nCorporate/Other \u2019s future\nresults, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above, \u201cForward-\nLooking Statements\u201d below and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nin Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  2022 YTD vs. 2021 YTD                                         \n                                                                \nYear-to-date, Corporate/Other\nexperienced similar trends\n\nto those described above.

Citi\u2019s CET1 Capital\nratio under the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches was 11.7%\nas of June 30, 2022, compared\nto 11.4% as of March 31, 2022\nand 12.3% as of December 31,\n2021, relative to an effective\nregulatory minimum CET1\nCapital ratio requirement of\n10.0% under the Advanced\nApproaches.\n\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nincreased under both the\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches from March\n31, 2022, driven primarily by\nnet income, a decrease in\nrisk-weighted assets and the\nimpact related to the closing\nof the Australia consumer\nbanking sale, partially offset\nby interest rate-related\nadverse net movements in AOCI\nand the return of capital to\ncommon shareholders .\n\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\ndecreased under both the\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches from year-\nend 2021, as the interest\nrate-related adverse net\nmovements in AOCI and the\nreturn of capital to common\nshareholders were partially\noffset by year-to-date net\nincome of $8.9 billion and the\nimpact related to the closing\nof the Australia consumer\nbanking sale. The decline in\nthe CET1 Capital ratio also\nreflected higher risk-weighted\nassets due to adoption of the\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk (SA-\nCCR) under both the\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches. The\nincrease in risk-weighted\nassets from SA-CCR under the\nStandardized Approach was more\nthan offset by lower risk-\nweighted assets due to\nbusiness-driven declines in\nderivatives and repo-style\ntransactions.

Citi\u2019s\neffective minimum CET1 Capital\nratio requirement under the\nAdvanced Approaches (using the\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer) will\nremain unchanged at 10.0%.\n\nAs previously disclosed,\ncommencing January 1, 2023,\nCiti\u2019s GSIB surcharge will\nincrease from 3.0% to 3.5%,\nwhich will be applicable to\nboth the Standardized and the\nAdvanced Approaches, resulting\nin a required minimum CET1\nCapital ratio of 12.0% under\nthe Standardized Approach and\n10.5% under the Advanced\nApproaches, both as of such\ndate.\n\nThe SCB applies to Citigroup\nonly.

The amount excluded was reduced by $1.8\nbillion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible assets that are separately deducted\nfrom capital. DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required\nto be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under\nthe U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences are required to be deducted from capital only if\nthese DTAs exceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S. Basel III\nrules.\n\n(5) Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs\narising from temporary differences and significant common stock\ninvestments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At June\n30, 2022, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from\ntemporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. At\nDecember 31, 2021, none of these assets were in excess of the\n10%/15% limitations.\n\n(6) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities that were previously eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules. Commencing January 1,\n2022, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities have been\nfully phased out of Tier 2 Capital.\n\n(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit\nlosses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25%\nof credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for\ncredit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted\nassets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in\nwhich eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit\nlosses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the\nextent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit\nreserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible\nfor inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under\nthe Advanced Approaches framework

Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated\nprobability of default for a counterparty and are derived by\nleveraging validated statistical models, scorecard models and\nexternal agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in\ncombination with consideration of factors specific to the\nobligor or market, such as management experience, competitive\nposition, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility\nrisk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of\ndefault of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given\ndefault of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal\nobligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are\nconsidered investment grade, while those below are considered\nnon-investment grade.\n                               33                               \nThe following table presents\nthe corporate credit portfolio\nby facility risk rating as a\npercentage of the total\ncorporate credit portfolio:\n                                                                \n                    Total                                       \n                 exposure                          December     \n                 June 30,       March 31,               31,     \n                     2022            2022              2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A             50  %           49  %             48  %  \n  BBB                  33              33                34     \n  BB/B                 15              16                16     \n  CCC or                2               2                 2     \n  below                                                         \n  Total               100  %          100  %            100  %  \n                                                                \nNote: Total exposure includes\ndirect outstandings and\nunfunded lending commitments.\nIn addition to the obligor and\nfacility risk ratings assigned\nto all exposures, Citi may\nclassify exposures in the\ncorporate credit portfolio.\nThese classifications are\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\ninterpretation of the U.S.\nbanking regulators\u2019 definition\nof criticized exposures, which\nmay categorize exposures as\nspecial mention, substandard,\ndoubtful or loss. Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly, and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citigroup\nbelieves the corporate credit\nportfolio to be appropriately\nrated and classified as of\nJune 30, 2022. Citigroup has\ntaken action to adjust\ninternal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, downgrades may\nresult in the purchase of\nadditional credit derivatives\nor other risk mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

The portfolio is\ngenerally delinquency managed,\nwhere Citi evaluates credit\nrisk based on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nmortgages in this portfolio\nhave historically been\nextended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than 80% on first and\nsecond mortgages. For\nadditional information, see \u201c\nLoan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios\u201d in\nNote 13. As shown in the chart\nabove, the net credit loss\nrate in Retail banking for the\nsecond quarter of 2022\ndecreased quarter-over-\nquarter, due to industry-wide\nepisodic overdraft losses in\nthe prior quarter and early in\nthe second quarter, and\nincreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the\nepisodic losses. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate\ndeclined quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, primarily\nreflecting the continued\nimpacts of government\nstimulus, unemployment\nbenefits and consumer relief\nprograms.\n                 \n  Global Wealth  \n                 \nThe Global Wealth credit\nportfolio primarily consists\nof consumer mortgages, cards\nand other lending products\nextended to customer segments\nthat range from the affluent\nto ultra-high-net-worth\nthrough both the Private bank\nand Citigold. These customer\nsegments represent a target\nmarket that is characterized\nby historically low default\nrates and delinquencies. As of\nJune 30, 2022, $54.8 billion,\nor 37%, of the portfolio was\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of margin\nlending, commercial real\nestate, subscription credit\nfinance and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\n\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit risk\nbased on their internal risk\nrating, of which 94% is rated\ninvestment grade. In the chart\nabove, while the delinquency\nrate is calculated only for\nthe delinquency-managed\nportfolio, the net credit loss\nrate is calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate for the\nsecond quarter of 2022 was\nlargely stable quarter-over-\nquarter and declined year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nthe impact of the charge-off\nof peak delinquent loans in\nAsia in early 2021, resulting\nin lower delinquencies that\nled to lower net credit\nlosses. The 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate declined\nquarter-over\u2010quarter, and was\nunchanged year-over-year.\nLegacy Franchises Legacy\nFranchises provides\ntraditional retail banking and\nbranded card products to\nretail and small business\ncustomers in Asia Consumer and\nMexico Consumer.\n                   \n  Asia(1)Consumer  \n                   \n(1) Asia Consumer includes\nLegacy Franchises activities\nin certain EMEA countries for\nall periods presented.

The decrease\nwas also driven by the\nreclassification of\napproximately $19 billion of\nloans ($13 billion of retail\nbanking loans and $6 billion\nof credit card loan balances)\nto held-for-sale as a result\nof Citi\u2019s agreements to sell\nits consumer banking\nbusinesses in the Philippines,\nBahrain, India, Indonesia,\nMalaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and\nVietnam (Asia HFS reclass).\nThe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate remained\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and decreased year-\nover-year, mainly driven by\nthe impact of the Asia HFS\nreclass and the charge-off of\npeak delinquencies. The\nperformance of Asia Consumer\u2019s\nportfolios continues to\nreflect the strong credit\nprofiles in the region\u2019s\ntarget customer segments.\nRegulatory changes in many\nmarkets in\n                               40                               \nAsia over the past few years\nhave also resulted in improved\ncredit quality.\n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex and\nprovides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nMexico Consumer serves a more\nmass-market segment in Mexico\nand focuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As shown in\nthe chart above, the second\nquarter of 2022 net credit\nloss rate in Mexico Consumer\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, driven by\nthe impact of the charge-off\nof peak delinquencies in early\n2021, resulting in lower\ndelinquencies that led to\nlower net credit losses in the\ncurrent quarter. The decline\nwas also driven by growth in\ncard balances.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $119 million ($0.7 billion), $161 million ($0.9\nbillion) and $150 million ($0.7 billion) at June 30, 2022, March\n31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The amounts excluded\nfor loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans\nhave the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans)\nwere $72 million, $62 million and $80 million at June 30, 2022,\nMarch 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in\nthe table include the guaranteed loans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail\nservices are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup\u2019s\npolicy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans\nuntil 180 days past due, unless a notification of bankruptcy\nfiling has been received earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status, and therefore\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of June 30,\n2022, March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, 94%, 92% and 95% of the\nGlobal Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated investment\ngrade. For additional information on the credit quality of the\nGlobal Wealth portfolio, including classifiably managed\nportfolios, see \u201cConsumer Credit Trends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain\nEMEA countries for all periods presented.\n                               42                               \n(8) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nconsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nreclassifications commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21, and\nclosed on June 1, 2022), the Philippines (4Q21) and Bahrain,\nIndia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (1Q22).\nSee Note 2 for additional information.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $84 million ($0.2 billion), $124 million ($0.4\nbillion) and $125 million ($0.4 billion) at June 30, 2022, March\n31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The amounts excluded\nfor loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans\nhave the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans)\nwere $27 million, $34 million and $48 million at June 30, 2022,\nMarch 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively.

average loans in certain\nEMEA countries (Russia, Poland and Bahrain) for all periods\npresented.\n\n(4) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nconsumer banking businesses, which have been reclassified as HFS\nin Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. As a result, approximately $50 million and $53\nmillion in related net credit losses (NCLs) were recorded as a\nreduction in revenue ( Other revenue ) in the second and first\nquarters of 2022, respectively. Accordingly, these NCLs are not\nincluded in this table.

Corporate non-accrual\nloans may still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within\nCorporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. While corporate non-accrual loans are down year-over-year\nand quarter-over-quarter, the increase from December 31, 2021\nrelates to Russia-related exposures, which are adequately\nreserved for.\n\n(2) Approximately 52%, 66%, 56%, 58% and 55% of Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans were performing at June 30, 2022, March 31,\n2022, December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021 and June 30,

End-of-\nperiod loans decreased 3%\nyear-over-year as growth in\nICG and PBWM (up 2% and 4%,\nrespectively) was more than\noffset by lower loans in\nLegacy Franchises . End-of-\nperiod loans were largely\nunchanged sequentially. On an\naverage basis, loans declined\n2% year-over-year and\nincreased 1% sequentially. The\nyear-over-year decline was\nprimarily due to Legacy\nFranchises , which more than\noffset growth in both PBWM and\nICG . The decline in Legacy\nFranchises primarily reflected\nthe reclassification of loans\nto Other assets to reflect\nheld-for-sale accounting as a\nresult of the signing of sales\nagreements for consumer\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA.\nPBWM average loans increased\n4% year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by Branded cards,\nRetail services and Global\nWealth.

End-of-\nperiod deposits increased 1%\nyear-over-year, largely driven\nby growth in Treasury and\ntrade solutions (TTS) and\nGlobal Wealth. End-of-period\ndeposits decreased 1%\nsequentially. On an average\nbasis, deposits were largely\nunchanged year-over-year and\ndeclined 1% sequentially.\nYear-over-year, average\ndeposits reflected a decline\nin Legacy Franchises due to\nthe impact of held-for-sale\naccounting as a result of the\nsigning of sale agreements for\nconsumer franchises in Asia\nand EMEA. The decline was\nlargely offset by a 6%\nincrease in PBWM , led by\ngrowth in both U.S. Personal\nBanking and Global Wealth.

The\nweighted-average maturity is\ncalculated based on the\ncontractual maturity of each\nsecurity. For securities that\nare redeemable prior to\nmaturity at the option of the\nholder, the weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the earliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable. Citi\u2019s\nlong-term debt outstanding at\nthe Citigroup parent company\nincludes benchmark senior and\nsubordinated debt and what\nCiti refers to as customer-\nrelated debt, consisting of\nstructured notes, such as\nequity- and credit-linked\nnotes, as well as non-\nstructured notes. Citi\u2019s\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt is generally driven by\ncustomer demand and\ncomplements benchmark debt\nissuance as a source of\nfunding for Citi\u2019s non-bank\nentities. Citi\u2019s long-term\ndebt at the bank includes bank\nnotes, FHLB advances and\nsecuritizations.\n\nLong-Term Debt Outstanding The\nfollowing table presents\nCiti\u2019s end-of-period total\nlong-term debt outstanding for\neach of the dates indicated:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  billions                                                      \n  of                Jun. 30,         Mar. 31,         Jun. 30,  \n  dollars               2022             2022             2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Non-bank\u2026                                                     \n  Benchmark                                                     \n  debt:                                                         \n  Senior       $       120.3    $       122.2    $       127.8  \n  debt                                                          \n  Subordin\u2026             24.0             24.7             26.2  \n  debt                                                          \n  Trust                  1.6              1.6              1.7  \n  preferred                                                     \n  Customer\u2026             84.9             78.4             73.9  \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                7.8              7.8              6.3  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $       238.6    $       234.7    $       235.9  \n  non-bank                                                      \n  Bank                                                          \n  FHLB         $         2.3    $         1.0    $         9.5  \n  borrowin\u2026                                                     \n  Securiti\u2026              9.5              9.5             11.6  \n  Citibank                                                      \n  benchmark              2.6              3.5              3.7  \n  senior                                                        \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                4.4              5.3              3.9  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $        18.8    $        19.3    $        28.7  \n  bank                                                          \n  Total                                                         \n  long-term    $       257.4    $       254.0    $       264.6  \n  debt                                                          \n                                                                \nNote: Amounts represent the\ncurrent value of long-term\ndebt on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet that, for\ncertain debt instruments,\nincludes consideration of fair\nvalue, hedging impacts and\nunamortized discounts and\npremiums.

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $198\nbillion as of June 30, 2022\ndecreased 11% from the prior-\nyear period and decreased 3%\nsequentially, driven by normal\nbusiness activity. The average\nbalance for secured funding\nwas approximately $208 billion\nfor the quarter ended June 30,\n2022.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nJune 30, 2022.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $40 billion increased 27%\nyear-over-year and 33%\nsequentially, reflecting an\nincrease in FHLB advances and\ncommercial paper issuance (see\nNote 16 for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               55                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

As detailed under \u201cHigh-\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d\nabove, Citigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. As of June\n30, 2022, Citibank had\nliquidity commitments of\napproximately $9.0 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\ncompared to $9.1 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2022 (see Note 18\nfor additional information).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               56                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(17) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof June 30, 2022.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nThe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income (IRE)\ndeclined from the first\nquarter of 2022, driven by\nlower expected gains due to\nU.S. dollar rate moves that\nhave already been realized. At\nhigher rate levels, Citi\nassumes it will pass on a\nlarger share of rate changes\nto its depositors, further\nreducing Citi\u2019s IRE\nsensitivity.\n\nThe decline in the estimated\nimpact to AOCI primarily\nreflected a continuation of\nthe positioning strategy of\nCiti\u2019s investment securities\nand related interest rate\nderivatives portfolio.\n\nIn the event of a parallel\ninstantaneous 100 bps increase\nin interest rates, as of June\n30, 2022, Citi expects that\nthe $2.5 billion initial\nnegative impact to AOCI would\nbe offset in stockholders\u2019\nequity through the expected\nrecovery of the impact on AOCI\nthrough accretion of Citi\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio and\nexpected NII benefit over\napproximately 11 months.\n\nCiti is planning to transition\nthe sensitivity analysis for\nits net interest income,\nemploying enhanced\nmethodologies and changes to\ncertain assumptions. The\nchanges include, among other\nthings, assumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet\n(holding it static), coupled\nwith revisions to the\ntreatment of certain business\ncontributions to IRE. These\nchanges will be implemented\nand disclosed before the end\nof 2022 and will result in a\nbetter reflection of the\nnature of the portfolios.\n\nThe following table presents\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under five\ndifferent changes in interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and Citi\u2019s other\ncurrencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d). The rate\nscenarios are also impacted by\nconvexity related to mortgage\nproducts.\n                               57                               \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  of                                                            \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  ex\u2026                                                           \n  as                                                            \n  ot\u2026                                                           \n  no\u2026                                                           \n  Ov\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  10\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  an\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to        Sce\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026  \n  net          1          2           3          4           5  \n  in\u2026        100        100           \u2014          \u2014       (100)  \n  in\u2026        100          \u2014         100       (10\u2026       (100)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.\u2026    $   332    $   345    $      5    $    -1    $   -538  \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  All                                                           \n  ot\u2026        693        633          38        -38        -533  \n  cu\u2026                                                           \n  To\u2026    $  1,0\u2026    $   978    $     43    $   -39    $  -1,0\u2026  \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  -2,\u2026    $  -1,\u2026    $   -627    $   484    $  2,416  \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to                                                            \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  Eq\u2026        -10         -8          -3          2           9  \n  Ti\u2026                                                           \n  1                                                             \n  Ca\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes\nthat the rate change will\noccur instantaneously.

This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nEuro and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the impact\nof these changes on Citi\u2019s TCE\nand Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of June 30, 2022, there were two back-\ntesting exceptions observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR in the\nlast 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K. LIBOR Transition\nRisk The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act),\nenacted earlier this year, provides for the use of a statutory\nreplacement for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month\nand 12-month tenors of USD LIBOR in all contracts governed by\nU.S. law that lack adequate fallback provisions. On July 28,\n2022, the Federal Reserve Board published in the Federal\nRegister its proposed rulemaking that implements the LIBOR Act.\nThe proposal contains the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s recommendation\nof benchmark replacements for various product types. As required\nby the LIBOR Act, each proposed replacement rate is based on the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Citi continues to\nreview the effect of the LIBOR Act and the Federal Reserve\nBoard\u2019s proposal, which is expected to facilitate the transition\nto replacement rates for Citi\u2019s USD LIBOR-linked securities,\nloans and contracts without fallbacks or fallbacks based on USD\nLIBOR that have not yet been remediated.

For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries,\n\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers. As an\nexample, with respect to the\nU.K., only 37% of corporate\nloans presented in the table\nbelow are to U.K. domiciled\nentities (37% for unfunded\ncommitments), with the balance\nof the loans predominately to\nEuropean domiciled\ncounterparties. Approximately\n88% of the total U.K. funded\nloans and 87% of the total\nU.K. unfunded commitments were\ninvestment grade as of June\n30, 2022.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

                       \n(1) Investment securities include debt securities available-for-\nsale (AFS), recorded at fair market value, primarily local\ngovernment debt securities. AO Citibank had AFS debt securities\nlosses during the first quarter of 2022 due to yield increases,\nwhich were reflected in AOCI , although no credit impairment was\nrecognized on the losses. There were no impairment losses\nrecognized during the second quarter of 2022.\n\n(2) Net mark-to-market (MTM) on OTC derivatives and securities\nlending/borrowing transactions (repos). The increase during the\ncurrent quarter is because reverse repurchase agreements of $1.3\nbillion were shown gross of collateral and reclassified to net\nMTM on derivatives/repos in the table above, as netting of\ncollateral for Russia-related reverse repurchase agreements was\nremoved. This removal was due to the inability to conclude, with\na well-founded basis, the enforceability of contractual rights\nin the Russian legal system in the event of a counterparty\ndefault, given the geopolitical uncertainty caused by the war in\nUkraine. As this exposure was already included in Total third-\nparty exposure, the Total Russia exposure was not impacted by\nthis reclassification.\n\n(3) Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending\ncommitments, letters of credit and other contingencies.\n\n(4) Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the\nCentral Bank of Russia.\n\n(5) The majority of AO Citibank\u2019s third-party exposures was\nfunded with domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and\npersonal banking clients.\n\n(6) Citigroup\u2019s currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss\nincluded in its Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)\nrelated to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded\nfrom the above table, because the CTA loss is not held in AO\nCitibank and would be recognized in Citigroup\u2019s earnings upon\neither the substantial liquidation of AO Citibank or a loss of\ncontrol of AO Citibank. Citi has separately described these\nrisks in \u201cDeconsolidation Risk\u201d below.\n                               72                               \nDuring the second quarter,\nCiti continued to reduce its\noperations in Russia and\nRussia-related exposures,\nresulting in a decline in\nlocal currency exposure of\n$3.1 billion, which was more\nthan offset by an increase of\n$3.6 billion due to an\napproximate 40% appreciation\nof the Russian ruble versus\nthe U.S. dollar during the\nquarter, for a net increase in\nTotal Russia exposure of $0.5\nbillion in the table above.\n\nThe $3.1 billion decline in\nexposure was driven by Citi\u2019s\nrisk mitigation efforts,\nincluding a reduction in\nloans, as well as a reduction\nin cash on deposits and\nplacements. The reduction in\nloans primarily reflected a\ndecline in ICG loans due to\nborrower paydowns and limiting\nextensions of new credit. ICG\n\u2019s credit exposure also\nreflected a shift to a higher\nproportion of stronger credit\nnames, including a higher\nproportion of subsidiaries of\nmultinational companies that\nare headquartered outside of\nRussia, primarily in the U.S.\nand Europe. The decline in\noverall exposure was also\ndriven by a reduction in\nexposures to Russian\ncounterparties not held by AO\nCitibank.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Russia was\napproximately $1.2 billion as\nof June 30, 2022 (compared to\n$0.7 billion as of March 31,\n2022). The increase was\nprimarily driven by the\naforementioned ruble\nappreciation. A significant\nportion of Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment was hedged for\nforeign currency depreciation\nas of June 30, 2022, using\nforward foreign exchange\ncontracts executed with\ninternational peer banks. In\nthe event of a loss of control\nof AO Citibank, in addition to\na write-off of the $1.2\nbillion net investment,\n\nCiti would also recognize a\nCTA loss of approximately $0.9\nbillion (compared to $1.0\nbillion as of March 31, 2022)\nand $0.4 billion on\nintercompany liabilities\n(compared to $0.7 billion as\nof March 31, 2022) owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities at the end of the\nsecond quarter of 2022 (see\n\u201cDeconsolidation Risk\u201d below).\nIn the future, Citi may record\ndevaluations on its net ruble-\ndenominated assets in\nearnings, without the benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposures.\n                                                                \n  2Q22 Earnings Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses                    \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ICG , PBWM and Legacy\nFranchises segments were\nimpacted by a broad array of\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including, among\nother things, impacts related\nto the war in Ukraine:\n\n\u2022 ICG Markets revenues of $5.3\nbillion increased 25% versus\nthe second quarter of the\nprior year, reflecting higher\nrevenues in Fixed income\nmarkets and Equity markets,\ndriven by higher volatility,\nleading to client engagement.\nFixed income markets revenues\nincreased 31%, with growth\nacross all regions, due to\nstrong client engagement,\nparticularly with corporate\nclients.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\nincreased 66%, driven by\nincreased market volatility\nresulting from increasing\ninterest rates from central\nbanks in response to elevated\nlevels of inflation. The\nincrease in rates and\ncurrencies revenues was\npartially offset by a\nliquidity valuation adjustment\nof approximately $130 million\nfor Russian sovereign bonds\ndue to impacts from sanctions.\nSpread products and other\nfixed income revenues\ndecreased 29%, reflecting\nlower client activity in\nspread products and a\n\nchallenging market environment\ndue to widening spreads. The\ndecline in spread products and\nother fixed income revenues\nwas partially offset by\nstrength in commodities,\nparticularly with corporate\nclients.\n\nEquity markets revenues\nincreased 8%, primarily driven\nby equity derivatives,\nreflecting strong client\nengagement with both corporate\nand institutional clients,\npartially offset by lower\nclient activity in cash and a\nnet decrease in prime\nbalances, as lower asset\nvaluations more than offset\nnew client balances.\n\n\u2022 ICG Banking revenues of $2.1\nbillion decreased 4% compared\nto the prior-year period,\nlargely driven by a decline in\nInvestment banking revenues.\nInvestment banking revenues\ndeclined 46%, reflecting a\nlower overall market wallet,\nas continued heightened\ngeopolitical uncertainty and\nthe overall macroeconomic\nbackdrop reduced activity.\n\n\u2022 Global Wealth revenues of\n$1.9 billion, recorded in PBWM\n, were largely unchanged,\nreflecting investment fee\nheadwinds, particularly in\nAsia, driven by overall market\nvolatility, offset by an\nincrease in average deposits\nand average loans. Client\nassets decreased 8%, driven\nprincipally by declines in\nmarket valuation.\n\n\u2022 Legacy Franchises revenues\nof $1.9 billion decreased 15%\nversus the second quarter in\nthe prior year, primarily\ndriven by the impacts related\nto the Korea wind-down and\nAustralia consumer sale, as\nwell as lower investment\nactivity in Asia, largely\ndriven by market volatility\nand macroeconomic challenges\nand uncertainties. The decline\nin revenues was also driven by\na portion of the release of a\nCTA loss (net of hedges) from\nAOCI related to the\nsubstantial liquidation of a\nlegacy U.K. consumer\noperation.\n\n\u2022 Citigroup expenses increased\nby approximately $70 million\ndue to a Russia-related\nimpairment charge for long-\nlived assets, recorded in\nLegacy Franchises (see \u201cLong-\nLived Assets Impairment\u201d\nbelow).\n\n\u2022 Citigroup cost of credit of\n$1.3 billion in the current\nquarter compared to $(1.1)\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod, reflecting a net build\nin the ACL of $0.4 billion,\ncompared to a net release of\n$2.4 billion in the prior-year\nperiod, partially offset by\nlower net credit losses.\nCitigroup\u2019s higher cost of\ncredit was largely driven by\nhigher ICG and PBWM cost of\ncredit.\n\nICG cost of credit of $(202)\nmillion compared to $(694)\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, with a net ACL release\nof $245 million and net credit\nlosses of $18 million. The\nrelease was largely driven by\na reduction in Russia-related\nrisk in the quarter, partially\noffset by a build due to\nincreased macroeconomic\nuncertainty.\n\nPBWM cost of credit of $1.4\nbillion compared to $(170)\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by a\nnet ACL build of $651 million\nin the current quarter,\ncompared to a net ACL release\nof $1.0 billion in the prior-\nyear period, reflecting\nincreased macroeconomic\nuncertainty. Net credit losses\ndeclined 19%, reflecting\ncontinued strong credit\nperformance across portfolios.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$1.6 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct and\nindirect Russian exposure,\nconsisting of approximately\n                               73                               \n$0.8 billion related to Citi\u2019s\nexposures to Russian\ncounterparties and\napproximately $0.8 billion\nrelated to the impact of the\nwar in Ukraine on the broader\nglobal macroeconomic\nenvironment.\n                                                                \n  Long-Lived Assets Impairment                                  \n                                                                \nIn the second quarter of 2022,\nCiti recorded an impairment\ncharge of approximately $70\nmillion for long-lived assets\nrelated to the Russia consumer\nbanking business. These assets\nincluded property, plant and\nequipment, internally\ndeveloped software and the\n\u201cright of use assets\u201d on\nleased buildings.\n\nCiti\u2019s Planned Reduction of\nCertain Russia Businesses\n\nAs discussed above, Citi\ncontinues to reduce its\nactivities in Russia. Given\nthe complex environment, Citi\nis considering a full range of\npossibilities to exit or\nsubstantially reduce its\nactivities in Russia,\nincluding portfolio sales. Any\nadditional financial or\neconomic sanctions that may be\nimplemented by the U.S., the\nU.K., the EU and any other\njurisdictions, as well as any\ngovernmental approvals that\nmay be required for any exit,\nmay cause delays or reduce the\ncertainty of such exit being\nconcluded. Such delays may be\nsignificant.\n                                                                \n  Deconsolidation Risk                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s continued operations in\nRussia subject it to various\nrisks, including, among\nothers, foreign currency\nvolatility, including\nappreciations or devaluations;\nbusiness restrictions;\nsanctions or asset freezes; or\nother deconsolidation events\n(for additional information,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d\nin Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K).\nExamples of triggers that may\nresult in deconsolidation of\nAO Citibank include voluntary\nor forced sale of ownership or\nloss of control due to actions\nof relevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management. As of\nJune 30, 2022, Citi continued\nto consolidate AO Citibank\nbecause none of the\ndeconsolidation factors was\ntriggered.\n\nAs discussed above, in the\nevent of a loss of control of\nAO Citibank, Citi would be\nrequired to write off its net\ninvestment of approximately\n$1.2 billion (compared to $0.7\nbillion as of March 31, 2022)\nand recognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $0.9 billion\nthrough earnings (compared to\n$1.0 billion as of March 31,\n2022), in addition to a loss\nof $0.4 billion (compared to\n$0.7 billion as of March 31,\n2022) on intercompany\nliabilities owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities. In addition, in the\nsole event of a substantial\nliquidation, Citi would be\nrequired to recognize the CTA\nloss of approximately $0.9\nbillion through earnings and\nwould evaluate its remaining\nnet investment as\ncircumstances evolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients              \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nits role as paying agent, Citi\nacts as an agent of its\nclient, the bond issuer,\nreceiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\n\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients that are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or block\nthe funds until applicable\nsanctions are lifted or the\npayment is otherwise\nauthorized under applicable\nlaw.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its presence in\nRussia and association with\nRussian individuals or\nentities, whether subject to\nsanctions or not, including\nCiti\u2019s inability to support\nits global clients in Russia\nas part of its core value\nproposition, which could\nadversely affect its broader\nclient relationships and\nbusinesses; involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy toward\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact on Citi\u2019s Russia\nbusiness from its activity and\nengagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses. Citi has\nconsidered the potential for\nreputation risk and taken\nactions to mitigate such\nrisks. Citi established a\nRussia Special Review Process\nwith Management\u2019s Reputation\nRisk Committee with oversight\nfor significant Russia-related\nreputation risks and completed\na number of reputation risk\nreviews of matters with a\nRussian nexus.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to reduce its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the exit\nprocess, which may take\nsignificant time to complete.\nAlso, sanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi continues to\nperform services for, conduct\nbusiness with or deal in non-\nsanctioned Russian-owned\nbusinesses and Russian assets.\nThis has attracted, and will\nlikely continue to attract,\nnegative attention, despite\nthe previously announced plan\nto\n                               74                               \nsubstantially reduce its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

In\naddition to receiving regular\nbriefings from management, the\nfull Board has routinely been\ninvited to attend portions of\nthe RMC meetings for\ndiscussions related to the war\nin Ukraine, including with\nrespect to Citi\u2019s risk\nexposures and stress testing.\nThe reports to the Board and\nits Committees from senior\nmanagement who represent the\nimpacted businesses and the\nEMEA region, Independent Risk\nManagement, Finance,\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement, including those\nindividuals responsible for\nsanctions compliance, and\nHuman Resources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its ICG businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 250\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is the top priority.\n\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. Citi\u2019s\nexposures in Ukraine are not\nsignificant enough to be\nincluded in the \u201cTop 25\nCountry Exposures\u201d table\nabove. As of June 30, 2022,\nthese exposures amounted to\n$1.0 billion (compared to $0.9\nbillion as of March 31, 2022)\nand were exclusively composed\nof third-party assets held on\nthe Citi Ukraine subsidiary.\n                                                                \n  Turkey                                                        \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Turkey\nthrough its ICG businesses and\nconducts its operations\nthrough a subsidiary of\nCitibank. Since the fourth\nquarter of 2021, inflation in\nTurkey has increased\nsignificantly. At the end of\nFebruary 2022, the three-year\ncumulative inflation exceeded\n100%, and this increase in\ninflation is expected to\ncontinue in the near future.\nThe Turkish economy is deemed\nto be hyperinflationary and as\na result, the Citibank Turkey\nsubsidiary changed its\nfunctional currency from the\nTurkish lira to the U.S.\ndollar, effective April 1,\n2022.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, Citi\u2019s\nnet investment in its Turkey\noperations was approximately\n$327 million.\n                               75                               \n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its ICG businesses. As\nof June 30, 2022, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.6 billion. Citi uses the\nU.S. dollar as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\ncountries that are deemed\nhighly inflationary under U.S.\nGAAP. Citi uses Argentina\u2019s\nofficial market exchange rate\nto remeasure its net Argentine\npeso-denominated assets into\nthe U.S. dollar. As of June\n30, 2022, the official\nArgentine peso exchange rate\nagainst the U.S. dollar was\n125.23.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nCentral Bank of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat restrict Citi\u2019s ability\nto access U.S. dollars in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nAs a result, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations is likely to\ncontinue to increase as Citi\ngenerates net income in its\nArgentine franchise and its\nearnings cannot be remitted.\n\nDue to the currency controls\nimplemented by the Central\nBank of Argentina, certain\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms have developed that\nsome Argentine entities may\nuse to obtain U.S. dollars,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. However, if\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate converges with the\napproximate rate implied by\nthe indirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms, Citi could incur a\nloss on its capital in\nArgentina. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of June 30,\n2022, the international NDF\nmarket had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge its Argentine peso\nexposure. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute NDF contracts for this\nunhedged exposure in the\nfuture, Citi would record\ndevaluations on its net\nArgentine peso\u2010denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nany benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate ACL on\nits Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of June 30,\n2022. However, U.S. regulatory\nagencies may require Citi to\nrecord additional reserves in\nthe future, increasing ICG \u2019s\ncost of credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. The fair value of\nthese instruments is reported\non Citi\u2019s Consolidated\n\nBalance Sheet with the changes\nin fair value recognized in\neither the Consolidated\nStatement of Income or in AOCI\n.\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAdjudicating the temporary\nnature of fair value\nimpairments is also inherently\njudgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 20 and 21 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.\n                               77                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below shows Citi\u2019s\nACL as of the second quarter\nof 2022.

In\naddition, Citi reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables. These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover an R&S timeframe. The R&S\nforecast period for consumer\nand corporate loans is eight\nquarters.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic\nforecasts\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\n\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects portfolio\ncharacteristics and current\neconomic conditions not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent. Both the\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents are further\ndiscussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation, and (iv)\nreasonable and supportable\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default (PD),\nloss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD). The\nloss likelihood and severity\nmodels used for estimating\nexpected credit losses are\nsensitive to changes in\nmacroeconomic variables that\ninform the forecasts, and\ncover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency,\n                               78                               \nrisk ratings and loss recovery rates (among other things), as\nwell as other current economic factors and credit trends,\nincluding housing prices, unemployment and gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Qualitative Component The qualitative management\nadjustment component includes, among other things, management\nadjustments to reflect certain portfolio characteristics not\ncaptured in the quantitative component, such as concentrations,\ncollateral valuation, idiosyncratic events and other factors as\nrequired by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The\nqualitative management adjustment component also reflects\nuncertainty around the war in Ukraine and potential global\nrecession. The extent of the impact of the war in Ukraine will\ndepend on the spillover effects on European and global\nmacroeconomic and market factors, including inflation, interest\nrates and commodity prices. Qualitative reserves also include\nthe potential for normalization in portfolio performance and\nconsumer behavior, after record low losses as a result of\ngovernment stimulus and market liquidity. 2Q22 Changes in the\nACL In the second quarter of 2022, Citi had a build of $0.6\nbillion for the ACL for its consumer portfolios and releases of\n$0.3 billion for its corporate portfolios, for a net ACL build\nof $0.4 billion. The build was primarily driven by increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty reflected through an increase to the\nweight calculated for the downside macroeconomic scenario, which\ndrove an approximate $0.8 billion build, partially offset by a\n$0.3 billion release due to methodology refinements related to\nthe introduction of multiple macroeconomic scenarios in the\nquantitative ACL estimation process, as well as other net\nmovements of $0.1 billion. The build in the consumer ACL was\nprimarily driven by the impact of increased macroeconomic\nuncertainty. The release in the corporate ACL was primarily\ndriven by reductions of Citi\u2019s exposures in Russia, partially\noffset by the impact of increased macroeconomic uncertainty.\nBased on its latest macroeconomic forecast, Citi believes its\nanalysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic\nenvironment as of June 30, 2022. Macroeconomic Variables Citi\nconsiders a multitude of macroeconomic variables for the base,\nupside and downside macroeconomic forecasts it uses to estimate\nthe ACL, including domestic and international variables for its\nglobal portfolios and exposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of the U.S.\nunemployment rate and U.S. Real GDP growth rate represent the\nkey macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL. The tables below show Citi\u2019s forecasted\nquarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S.\nReal GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic\nforecast for Citi\u2019s ACL for each quarterly reporting period from\n2Q21 to 2Q22:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            3Q22       1Q23       3Q23       8-quart\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.0  %     3.8  %     3.6  %         4.2  %  \n  at 2Q21                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.9        3.9        3.8            4.0     \n  at 3Q21                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.9        3.7        3.7            3.8     \n  at 4Q21                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.6        3.5        3.5            3.6     \n  at 1Q22                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.5        3.6        3.8            3.7     \n  at 2Q22                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking eight\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. Real GDP                  2022       2023       2024     \n  Citi forecast                   3.7  %     2.0  %     1.8  %  \n  at 2Q21                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   3.9        2.1        1.8     \n  at 3Q21                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   4.0        2.2        1.8     \n  at 4Q21                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   3.3        2.4        2.1     \n  at 1Q22                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.6        1.8        2.0     \n  at 2Q22                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the Real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level. Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 2Q22, U.S. Real GDP growth\nis expected to remain strong\nduring the remainder of 2022\nand in 2023, and the\nunemployment rate is expected\nto increase slightly over the\nforecast horizon to return to\npre-pandemic levels. Scenario\nProbability Weighting Citi\u2019s\nACL is estimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nweights are calculated using a\nstatistical model, which among\nother factors, takes into\nconsideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nallowance for credit losses,\nseverity of the scenario and\nother macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Changes in\nthese factors in future\nquarters will impact the\nweights assigned in those\nquarters. During the second\nquarter of 2022, Citi\nincreased the weight that was\ncalculated for the downside\nscenario in order to reflect\nan increase in macroeconomic\nuncertainty driven by the\npotential impact of higher\ninflation, supply chain\ndisruptions and geopolitical\nrisks, including the war in\nUkraine. Citi\u2019s downside\nscenario incorporates more\nadverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario assumptions. Consumer\nAs discussed above, Citi had a\nbuild of $0.6 billion in the\nACLL for its consumer\nportfolios in the second\nquarter of 2022, which\nincreased the ACLL balance to\n$13.0 billion, or 3.65% of\ntotal consumer loans at June\n30, 2022. Citi\u2019s consumer ACLL\nis largely driven by U.S.\ncards. For U.S. cards, the\nlevel of reserves as a\npercentage of EOP loans\ndecreased to 7.48% at June 30,\n2022, compared to\n                               79                               \n7.56% at March 31, 2022,\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof volume growth in lower risk\nsegments, partially offset by\nincreased macroeconomic\nuncertainty. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to EOP\nloans was 1.2% at June 30,\n2022, unchanged from March 31,\n2022.\n\nCorporate\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nrelease of $0.1 billion in the\nsecond quarter of 2022, which\nreduced the ACLL reserve\nbalance by $56 million to $3.0\nbillion, or 1.00% of total\nfunded loans. The release was\nprimarily driven by reductions\nof exposures in Russia,\npartially offset by a build\nrelated to increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC release of\n$0.2 billion in the second\nquarter of 2022, which reduced\nthe ACLUC reserve balance,\nincluded in Other liabilities\n, to $2.2 billion. The release\nwas primarily driven by\nreductions of exposures in\nRussia, partially offset by a\nbuild for increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt June 30, 2022, the ratio of\nthe ACLL to total funded loans\nwas 2.44% (3.65% for consumer\nloans and 1.00% for corporate\nloans), compared to 2.35% at\nMarch 31, 2022 (3.53% for\nconsumer loans and 1.00% for\ncorporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $3.0 billion at June 30,\n2022, down $348 million from\nMarch 31, 2022. Consumer non-\naccrual loans decreased $137\nmillion to $1.4 billion at\nJune 30, 2022, compared to\n$1.5 billion at March 31,\n2022. Corporate non-accrual\nloans decreased $211 million\nto $1.7 billion at June 30,\n2022, compared to $1.9 billion\nat March 31, 2022. In\naddition, the ratio of non-\naccrual loans to total loans\nwas 0.55% and 0.39% for\ncorporate and consumer loans,\nrespectively, at June 30,\n2022.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has elected to phase in\nthe CECL impact for regulatory\ncapital purposes.

These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsignificant decline in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nDuring the first quarter of\n2022, Citi performed an\ninterim goodwill impairment\ntest due to the previously\ndisclosed changes in operating\nsegments and reporting units\nduring the quarter. The test\nresulted in an impairment of\n$535 million related to the\nAsia Consumer reporting unit\nwithin Legacy Franchises , due\nto the changes to Citi\u2019s\noperating segments and\nreporting units during the\nquarter, as well as the timing\nof mutual execution of sales\nagreements for Asia consumer\nbanking businesses.\n\nDuring the second quarter of\n2022, Citi\u2019s Banking reporting\nunit within the ICG operating\nsegment was negatively\nimpacted by the industry-wide\ndecline in investment banking\nactivity and macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties.\nThese conditions resulted in a\ncorresponding decline in the\noperating results of the\nBanking reporting unit as of\nJune 30, 2022, and\nqualitatively indicated that\nthe Banking reporting unit\u2019s\nfair value could be\ninsufficient to support its\ncarrying value, inclusive of\ngoodwill.\n\nAccordingly, Citi performed an\ninterim goodwill impairment\ntest for the Banking reporting\nunit as of June 30, 2022. This\nincluded completing an\nindependent valuation of the\nBanking reporting unit as of\nJune 30, 2022, which concluded\nthat the fair value of the\nBanking reporting unit\nexceeded its book value,\ninclusive of goodwill. The\nresults of the impairment test\nshowed that the fair value of\nthe Banking reporting unit as\na percentage of its carrying\nvalue was 102%, with the\ncarrying value including\napproximately $1.5 billion of\ngoodwill. Therefore no\nimpairment charge was recorded\nduring the quarter. No other\nevents or circumstances were\nidentified to indicate that\nthe fair values of Citi\u2019s\nother reporting units were\nmore-likely-than-not reduced\nbelow their respective\ncarrying amounts.\n\nBased on the interim\nimpairment tests, the fair\nvalue of Citi\u2019s reporting\nunits as a percentage of their\nallocated carrying values\nranged from approximately 102%\nto 267%, resulting in no\nfurther impairment recognized\nas of June 30, 2022. While the\ninherent risk related to\nuncertainty is embedded in the\nkey assumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as Citi\u2019s management\nimplements its strategic\nrefresh. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key\neconomic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture. See Note 15 for a\nfurther discussion of\ngoodwill, including key\nassumptions and related\nuncertainties that drive the\nfair value of the Banking\nreporting unit.\n                                                                \n  Litigation Accruals                                           \n                                                                \nSee the discussion in Note 23\nfor information regarding\nCiti\u2019s policies on\nestablishing accruals for\nlitigation and regulatory\ncontingencies.\n                               80                               \nINCOME TAXES Deferred Tax\nAssets For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s deferred\ntax assets (DTAs), see\n\u201cCapital Resources,\u201d \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks,\u201d\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d and\nNotes 1 and 9 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.

The increase from\nyear-end 2021 was primarily a\nresult of losses in Other\ncomprehensive income . Of\nCiti\u2019s $26.5 billion of net\nDTAs, $15.8 billion was not\ndeducted in calculating\nregulatory capital and was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder the Basel III rules. The\nremaining $10.7 billion\n(compared to $11.3 billion at\nMarch 31, 2022) was deducted\nin calculating Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. The $10.7\nbillion of DTA deducted from\nregulatory capital is composed\nof $11.7 billion related to\ntax carry-forwards and $0.8\nbillion of temporary\ndifferences in excess of the\n10%/15% regulatory\nlimitations, and is reduced by\n$1.8 billion of deferred tax\nliabilities, primarily\nassociated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible\nassets that are separately\ndeducted from capital. The\nprimary driver of the decrease\nin the DTA deducted from\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital\nduring the quarter was a\ndecline in the temporary\ndifferences in excess of the\n10%/15% regulatory limitations\n(from $1.2 billion at March\n31, 2022 to $0.8 billion at\nJune 30, 2022), which was\nattributable to a higher\ncapital limitation and lower\ntemporary difference DTAs\nsubject to the limitation. DTA\nRealizability Citi believes\nthat realization of the net\nDTAs of $26.5 billion at June\n30, 2022 is more-likely-than-\nnot based on management\u2019s\nexpectations of future taxable\nincome generation in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\nconsideration of available tax\nplanning strategies (as\ndefined in ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes ). Effective Tax\nRate Citi\u2019s reported effective\ntax rate for the second\nquarter of 2022 was 19.8%,\ncompared to the second quarter\nof 2021 effective tax rate of\n15.7%. The lower rate in the\nprior-year period reflected a\n$450 million valuation\nallowance release related to\nforeign tax credit carry-\nforwards, compared to a\nsignificantly lower release in\nthe current quarter. These\nreleases were due to revised\nprojections of future income.\n                               81                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of June 30, 2022\nand for the three- and six-\nmonth periods ended June 30,\n2022 and 2021 include the\naccounts of Citigroup Inc. and\nits consolidated subsidiaries.\nIn the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded within Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31,\n2021, Citigroup\u2019s Current\nReport on Form 8-K dated May\n10, 2022 (as amended by a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K/A\ndated May 10, 2022) with\nHistorical Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and Notes\nconformed to reflect changes\nin Citigroup\u2019s reportable\nsegments from those contained\nin Citi\u2019s 2021 Annual Report\non Form 10-K included as an\nexhibit thereto (such Current\nReport on Form 8-K together\nwith Citigroup\u2019s 2021 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K,\ncollectively referred to as\nthe 2021 Form 10-K), and\nCitigroup\u2019s Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended March 31, 2022 (First\nQuarter of 2022 Form 10-Q).\nCertain financial information\nthat is normally included in\nannual financial statements\nprepared in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP),\nbut is not required for\ninterim reporting purposes,\nhas been condensed or omitted.\nManagement must make estimates\nand assumptions that affect\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the related\nfootnote disclosures. While\nmanagement uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT\nACCOUNTING POLICIES See Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2021\nForm 10-K for a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Multiple\nMacroeconomic Scenarios-Based\nACL Approach During the second\nquarter of 2022, Citi refined\nits ACL methodology to utilize\nmultiple macroeconomic\nscenarios to estimate its\nallowance for credit losses.\nThe ACL was previously\nestimated using a combination\nof a single base-case forecast\nscenario as part of its\nquantitative component and a\nqualitative management\nadjustment to reflect economic\nuncertainty from downside\nmacroeconomic scenarios. As a\nresult of this change, Citi\nnow explicitly incorporates\nmultiple macroeconomic\nscenarios\u2014base, upside, and\ndownside\u2014and associated\nprobabilities in the\nquantitative component when\nestimating its ACL. This\nrefinement represents a\n\u201cchange in accounting\nestimate\u201d under ASC Topic 250,\nAccounting Changes and Error\nCorrections , with prospective\napplication beginning in the\nperiod of change. This change\nin accounting estimate\nresulted in a decrease of\napproximately $ 0.3billion in\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses, partially offsetting\nan increase of $ 0.8billion in\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses due to the increased\nmacroeconomic uncertainty and\nother factors in the second\nquarter. Accounting for\nDeposit Insurance Expenses\nDuring the fourth quarter of\n2021, Citi changed its\npresentation of accounting for\ndeposit insurance costs paid\nto the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC)\nand similar foreign\nregulators. These costs were\npreviously presented within\nInterest expense and, as a\nresult of this change, are now\npresented within Other\noperating expenses . Citi\nconcluded that this\npresentation was preferable in\nCiti\u2019s circumstances, as it\nbetter reflected the nature of\nthese deposit insurance costs\nin that these costs do not\ndirectly represent interest\npayments to creditors, but are\nsimilar in nature to other\npayments to regulatory\nagencies that are accounted\nfor as operating expenses.\nThis change in income\nstatement presentation\nrepresents a \u201cchange in\naccounting principle\u201d under\nASC Topic 250, Accounting\nChanges and Error Corrections\n, with retrospective\napplication to the earliest\nperiod presented. This change\nin accounting principle\nresulted in a reclassification\nof $ 279million and $\n619million of deposit\ninsurance expenses from\nInterest expense to Other\noperating expenses , for the\nquarter and six months ended\nJune 30, 2021. This change had\nno impact on Citi\u2019s net income\nor the total deposit insurance\nexpense incurred by Citi.\nFUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\nIn June 2022, FASB issued\nAccounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2022-3, Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\n. The ASU was issued to\naddress diversity in practice\nwhereby certain entities\nincluded the\n                               95                               \nimpact of contractual\nrestrictions when valuing\nequity securities, and it\nclarifies that a contractual\nrestriction on the sale of an\nequity security should not be\nconsidered part of the unit of\naccount of the equity security\nand, therefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair\nvalue. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to\ndisclose the fair value of\nequity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions,\nthe nature and remaining\nduration of the restrictions\nand the circumstances that\ncould cause a lapse in the\nrestrictions. The ASU is to be\nadopted on a prospective basis\nand will be effective for\nCitigroup on January 1, 2024,\nalthough early adoption is\npermitted. Adoption of the\naccounting standard is not\nexpected to have an impact on\nCiti\u2019s operating results or\nfinancial position, as the\nCompany excludes such\nrestrictions when valuing\nequity securities. Obligations\nto Safeguard Crypto-assets\nHeld for Platform Users In\nMarch 2022, the SEC issued\nStaff Accounting Bulletin\n(SAB) No. 121, which expresses\nthe views of the SEC staff\nregarding the accounting for\nobligations to safeguard\ncrypto-assets that an entity\nholds for platform users.\nSpecifically, the guidance\nrequires issuers that hold\ndigital assets for their\nplatform users to recognize a\nliability for their obligation\nto safeguard the digital\nassets held and a\ncorresponding asset, measured\ninitially and subsequently at\nfair value. The guidance is\neffective for interim and\nannual periods ending after\nJune 15, 2022. Citigroup does\nnot have any transactions\nwithin the scope of SAB 121 as\nof June 30, 2022. Fair Value\nHedging\u2014Portfolio Layer Method\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives\nand Hedging (Topic 815): Fair\nValue Hedging\u2014Portfolio Layer\nMethod , intended to better\nalign hedge accounting with an\norganization\u2019s risk management\nstrategies. Specifically, the\nguidance expands the current\nsingle-layer method to allow\nmultiple hedge layers of a\nsingle closed portfolio of\nqualifying assets, which\ninclude both prepayable and\nnon-prepayable assets. Upon\nthe adoption of the guidance,\nentities may elect to\nreclassify securities held-to-\nmaturity to the available-for-\nsale category as long as the\nreclassified securities are\ndesignated in a portfolio\nhedge. The guidance is\neffective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15,\n2022, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years with\nearly adoption permitted. Citi\nis evaluating when to adopt\nthe amendments in ASU 2022-01.\nCiti does not expect a\nmaterial impact to its results\nof operations as a result of\nadopting the amendments.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosures In\nMarch 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures . The ASU\neliminates the accounting\nguidance for troubled debt\nrestructurings by creditors,\nenhances disclosure\nrequirements for certain loan\nrefinancings and\nrestructurings by creditors\nand requires that an entity\ndisclose current-period gross\nwrite-offs by year of\norigination for financing\nreceivables and net\ninvestments in leases within\nthe scope of Subtopic 326-20.\nThe guidance is effective\nbeginning January 1, 2023 and\nearly adoption is\n\npermitted. Citi plans to adopt\nthe amendments in ASU 2022-02\non January 1, 2023, and is\nevaluating the effect they\nwill have on its Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and\nrelated disclosures. Long-\nDuration Insurance Contracts\nIn August 2018, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2018-12,\nFinancial Services\u2014Insurance:\nTargeted Improvements to the\nAccounting for Long-Duration\nContracts , which changes the\nexisting recognition,\nmeasurement, presentation and\ndisclosures for long-duration\ncontracts issued by an\ninsurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i)\nimproves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the\nliability for future policy\nbenefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future\ncash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the\naccounting for certain market-\nbased options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or\naccount balance) contracts,\n(iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred\nacquisition costs and (iv)\nintroduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries,\nprimarily in Mexico, that\nissue long-duration insurance\ncontracts such as traditional\nlife insurance policies and\nlife-contingent annuity\ncontracts that will be\nimpacted by the requirements\nof ASU 2018-12. The effective\ndate of ASU 2018-12 was\ndeferred for all insurance\nentities by ASU 2019-09,\nFinancial Services\u2014Insurance:\nEffective Date (issued in\nOctober 2019) and by ASU\n2020-11, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate and Early Application\n(issued in November 2020).\nCiti plans to adopt the\ntargeted improvements in ASU\n2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and\nis currently evaluating the\nimpact of the standard on its\ninsurance subsidiaries. Citi\ndoes not expect a material\nimpact to its results of\noperations as a result of\nadopting the standard.\n                               96                               \n2.

As a result, a CTA\nloss (net of hedges) in AOCI\nof approximately $ 400million\npretax ($ 345million after-\ntax) related to the legacy\noperation was released to\nearnings in the current\nperiod. Out of the total CTA\nrelease, a $ 260million pretax\nloss ($ 221million after-tax\nloss) was attributable to the\nEgg Banking business noted\nabove, reported in\nDiscontinued operations , and\ntherefore the corresponding\nCTA release was also reported\nin Discontinued operations\nduring the second quarter. The\nremaining CTA release of a $\n140million pretax loss ($\n124million after-tax loss)\nrelated to Legacy Holdings\nAssets was reported as part of\nContinuing operations within\nLegacy Franchises .\n\nWhile the legacy operation was\ndivested in multiple sales\nover the years, each\ntransaction did not result in\nsubstantial liquidation given\nthat Citi retained certain\nliabilities noted above, which\nwere gradually settled over\ntime until reaching the point\nof substantial liquidation\nduring the second quarter,\ntriggering the release of the\nCTA loss to earnings.\n\nCash flows from Discontinued\noperations were not material\nfor the periods presented.\n                               97                               \nSignificant Disposals\n\nCiti entered into agreements to sell nineconsumer banking\nbusinesses that, in aggregate, will result in a transfer to HFS\nof approximately $ 29billion in assets, including $ 19billion of\nloans (net of allowance of $ 409million) and approximately $\n23billion in liabilities, including $ 22billion in deposits as\nof June 30, 2022.

The Australia consumer banking business had approximately $\n9.4billion in assets, including $ 9.3billion of loans (net of\nallowance of $ 140million) and excluding goodwill. The total\namount of liabilities was $ 7.3billion including $ 6.8billion in\ndeposits. The transaction generated a pretax loss on sale of\napproximately $ 800million ($ 665million after-tax), subject to\nclosing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue . The loss on\nsale primarily reflected the impact of an approximate pretax $\n620million currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss (net of\nhedges) ($ 470million after-tax) already reflected in the\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) component of\nequity. The sale closed on June 1, 2022, and the CTA-related\nbalance was removed from the AOCI component of equity, resulting\nin a neutral CTA impact to Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.\nThe income before taxes shown in the above table for Australia\nreflects the two months of Citi\u2019s ownership through June 1,\n2022.\n\n(4) These sales are expected to result in an after-tax gain upon\nclosing.\n\n(5) Income before taxes for the period in which the individually\nsignificant component was classified as HFS for all prior\nperiods presented. For Australia, excludes the pretax loss on\nsale.\n\nCiti did not have any other significant disposals to report as\nof June 30, 2022. As of August 3, 2022, Citi had not entered\ninto any other definitive sales agreements related to its\nrecently announced intention to pursue exits of its consumer\nfranchises in 12 remaining markets across Asia and EMEA.

In connection with\nthe announcement, Citibank\nKorea Inc. (CKI) commenced a\nvoluntary early termination\nprogram (Korea VERP). Due to\nthe voluntary nature of this\ntermination program, no\nliabilities for termination\nbenefits are recorded until\nCKI makes formal offers to\nemployees that are then\nirrevocably accepted by those\nemployees.

These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses.

primarily due to the\nincrease in global discount rates.\n(2) Gains due to settlement and curtailment relate to\ndivestiture activities.\n(3) The U.S. qualified pension plan is fully funded under\nspecified Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as\namended (ERISA), funding rules as of January 1, 2022 and no\nminimum required funding is expected for 2022.\n(4) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n                              107                               \n(5) The framework for the Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\nThe following table shows the change in AOCI related to

For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value\noption, as described in Notes 20 and 21. The remaining portion\nis carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 21. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

Citi did\nnot have any HTM securities that were delinquent or on non-\naccrual status at June 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021. There were\nno purchased credit-deteriorated HTM debt securities held by the\nCompany as of June 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021.\n                              120                               \nEvaluating Investments for Impairment AFS Debt Securities\nOverview\u2014AFS Debt Securities The Company conducts periodic\nreviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to\nevaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit\nlosses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company\u2019s\nintent to sell such securities. An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. Citi records no allowances\nfor credit losses on U.S. Treasury securities and U.S.\ngovernment-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, because\nthe Company expects to incur no credit losses in the event of\ndefault due to a history of incurring no credit losses and due\nto the nature of the counterparties. Equity Method Investments\nFor impaired equity method investments that Citi plans to sell\nprior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell, with no expectation that the fair value will\nrecover prior to the expected sale date, the full impairment is\nrecognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of severity and\nduration. The measurement of the OTTI does not include partial\nprojected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date. For\nimpaired equity method investments that management does not plan\nto sell nor will likely be required to sell prior to recovery of\nvalue, the evaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-\ntemporary is based on (i) whether and when an equity method\ninvestment will recover in value and (ii) whether the investor\nhas the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period\nof time sufficient to recover the value.

Fair\nValue Non-marketable equity\nsecurities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired. For\ndetails on impairment\nindicators that are\nconsidered, see Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K. When the qualitative\nassessment indicates that\nimpairment exists, the\ninvestment is written down to\nfair value, with the full\ndifference between the fair\nvalue of the investment and\nits carrying amount recognized\nin earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                     June 30, 2022               2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value           $          1,670    $         1,413  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026           Three                       Six             \n  of               Months                    Months             \n  dollars           Ended                     Ended             \n  Measur\u2026        June 30,                  June 30,             \n  altern\u2026            2022       2021           2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impair\u2026    $          6    $     4    $         6    $     4  \n  losses                                                        \n  Downwa\u2026                                                       \n  changes                                                       \n  for                   \u2014          \u2014              \u2014          \u2014  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n  Upward                                                        \n  changes                                                       \n  for                  48        215            134        296  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 for additional information on these nonrecurring\nfair value measurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                         June 30, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                           86  \n  Downward changes for                                       3  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       824  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

Because forgiveness of\nprincipal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically\nhave little to no impact on the loans\u2019 projected cash flows and\nthus little to no impact on the allowance established for the\nloans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be\nrecorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already\nbeen recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is\nrequired at the time of the modification.\n(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest\npayments may involve a below-market interest rate.\nThe following table presents total corporate loans modified in a\nTDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the\npayment default occurred within one yearof a permanent\nmodification. Default is defined as 60days past due, except for\nclassifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is\ndefined as 90days past due.\n                                                                \n                     TDR                          TDR           \n                     lo\u2026                          lo\u2026           \n                     th\u2026                          th\u2026           \n                     re\u2026                          re\u2026           \n                     wi\u2026                          wi\u2026           \n                     one                          one           \n                     ye\u2026                          ye\u2026           \n                     of                           of            \n                     mo\u2026                          mo\u2026           \n                     du\u2026                          du\u2026           \n                     the                          the           \n           TDR       Th\u2026       Six       T\u2026       Th\u2026       S\u2026  \n           ba\u2026       Mo\u2026       Mo\u2026       b\u2026       Mo\u2026       M\u2026  \n  In        at       En\u2026       En\u2026       at       En\u2026       E\u2026  \n  m\u2026       Ju\u2026       Ju\u2026       Ju\u2026       J\u2026       Ju\u2026       J\u2026  \n  of       30,       30,       30,       3\u2026       30,       3\u2026  \n  d\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026    $  148    $  \u2014      $  \u2014      $  2\u2026    $  \u2014      $  \u2014   \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  M\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026        16       \u2014         \u2014         80       \u2014         \u2014   \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  O\u2026        39       \u2014         \u2014         38       \u2014         \u2014   \n  T\u2026    $  203    $  \u2014      $  \u2014      $  4\u2026    $  \u2014      $  \u2014   \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding that\nwere considered TDRs as of the end of the reporting period.\n                              132                               \nConsumer Loans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed\nprimarily by PBWM and Legacy Franchises (except Mexico SBMM).\nThe tables below present details about these loans, including\nthe following loan categories: \u2022 Residential first mortgages and\nHome equity loans in North America offices primarily represent\nsecured mortgage lending to customers of Retail banking and\nGlobal Wealth (primarily Private bank and Citigold). \u2022 Credit\ncards in North America offices primarily represents unsecured\ncredit card lending to customers of Branded cards and Retail\nservices. \u2022 Personal, small business and other loans in North\nAmerica is primarily composed of classifiably managed loans to\ncustomers of Global Wealth (mostly within the Private bank) who\nare typically high credit quality borrowers that historically\nexperienced minimal delinquencies and credit losses.

The results of the 2021 annual\nimpairment test resulted in no impairment. As discussed in Note\n3, effective January 1, 2022, as part of its strategic refresh,\nCiti made changes to its management structure, which resulted in\nchanges in its operating segments and reporting units to reflect\nhow the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker, intends\nto manage the Company, allocate resources and measure\nperformance. Goodwill balances were reallocated across the new\nreporting units based on their relative fair values using the\nvaluation performed as of the effective date of the\nreorganization. Further, the goodwill balances associated with\ncertain Asia Consumer businesses within the Legacy Franchises\noperating segment were reclassified to HFS as of March 31, 2022.\nSee Note 2 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s divestiture activities.\nThe reorganization of Citi\u2019s reporting structure and the\nannounced sales of businesses within a reporting unit were\nidentified as triggering events for purposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. Consistent with the requirements of ASC 350,\ninterim goodwill impairment tests were performed that resulted\nin an impairment of $ 535million to the Asia Consumer reporting\nunit within the Legacy Franchises operating segment, due to the\nimplementation of Citi\u2019s revised operating segments and\nreporting units, as well as the timing of mutual execution of\nsales agreements for Asia consumer banking businesses. This\nimpairment was recorded in the first quarter of 2022 as an\noperating expense. The interim goodwill impairment tests were\nperformed using a combination of the income approach, market\napproach and bids from buyers, where available, to determine the\nfair value of its reporting units. During the second quarter of\n2022, Citi\u2019s Banking reporting unit within the ICG operating\nsegment was negatively impacted by the industry-wide decline in\ninvestment banking activity and macroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties. These conditions resulted in a corresponding\ndecline in the operating results of the Banking reporting unit\nas of June 30, 2022 and were identified as a triggering event\nfor purposes of goodwill impairment testing. Consistent with the\nrequirements of ASC 350, interim goodwill impairment tests were\nperformed that resulted in no impairment of the Banking\nreporting unit within the ICG operating segment. The results of\nthe impairment test showed that the fair value of the Banking\nreporting unit as a percentage of its carrying value was 102%,\nwith the carrying value including approximately $ 1.5billion of\ngoodwill. No other events or circumstances were identified for\nany other reporting unit as a triggering event for purposes of\ngoodwill impairment testing. The interim goodwill impairment\ntest was performed using a combination of the income approach\nand market approach to determine the fair value of its reporting\nunits. Under the market approach, Citi estimated fair value by\ncomparing the business to similar businesses or guideline\ncompanies whose securities are actively traded in public\nmarkets. Under the income approach, Citi used a discounted cash\nflow (DCF) model in which cash flows anticipated over several\nperiods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon,\nare discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate\nthat is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting\nunit. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of\nCiti\u2019s reporting units consisted primarily of significant\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value inputs), including\ndiscount rates, estimated cash flows, growth rates, earnings\nmultiples and/or transaction multiples of similar businesses or\nguideline public companies, and bids from buyers. The DCF method\nemploys a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount\nrate based on several factors including market interest rates,\nand includes adjustments for market risk and company-specific\nrisk. Estimated cash flows are based on internally developed\nestimates and the growth rates are based on industry knowledge\nand historical performance. Based on the interim impairment\ntests, the fair values of all of Citi\u2019s other reporting units as\na percentage of their\n                              152                               \nallocated carrying values ranged from approximately 102% to\n267%, resulting in no further impairment recognized as of June\n30, 2022. While the inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in\nthe key assumptions used in the valuations, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue to evolve as management\nimplements its strategic refresh. If management\u2019s future\nestimate of key economic and market assumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions, Citi could potentially experience\nmaterial goodwill impairment charges in the future.

2022 and December 31, 2021\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the\nCompany has any variable interest or continuing involvement\nconsidered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 86billion and $\n100billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 499million and $\n497million in maximum exposure to loss as of June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n                              159                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party-\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $\n50.5billion and $ 55.6billion, respectively (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Note 13 and Note 26 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citigroup\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the\nCompany holds securities in inventory, as these investments are\nmade on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and\nasset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and\n20 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              160                               \nFunding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated\nVIEs\u2014Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments\nThe following table presents the notional amount of liquidity\nfacilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding\ncommitments in the VIE tables above:\n                                                                \n                  June                    Decemb\u2026               \n                   30,                        31,               \n                  2022                       2021               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  milli\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026  \n  of           facili\u2026       commi\u2026       facili\u2026       commi\u2026  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Non-a\u2026                                                        \n  mortg\u2026    $        \u2014    $       5    $        \u2014    $       5  \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  Asset\u2026             \u2014       11,639             \u2014       12,189  \n  finan\u2026                                                        \n  Munic\u2026                                                        \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  tender                                                        \n  option         1,571            \u2014         1,498            \u2014  \n  bond                                                          \n  trusts                                                        \n  (TOBs)                                                        \n  Munic\u2026             \u2014        4,010             \u2014        3,562  \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  Inves\u2026             \u2014           20             \u2014           12  \n  funds                                                         \n  Other              \u2014            \u2014             \u2014            \u2014  \n  Total                                                         \n  fundi\u2026    $    1,571    $  15,674    $    1,498    $  15,768  \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of                                                \n  dollars                June 30, 2022       December 31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash                $              \u2014    $                  \u2014  \n  Trading account                  1.8                     1.4  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                      8.9                     8.8  \n  Total loans, net                39.6                    35.4  \n  of allowance                                                  \n  Other                            0.5                     0.8  \n  Total assets        $           50.8    $               46.4  \n                                                                \nCredit Card Securitizations\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s credit card securitization\nactivity is through twotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust\n(Master Trust) and Citibank Omni Trust (Omni Trust), with the\nsubstantial majority through the Master Trust.

Specifically, higher interest rates tend to lead\nto declining prepayments, which causes the fair value of the\nMSRs to increase. In managing this risk, Citigroup economically\nhedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through\nthe use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase\nand sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased\nsecurities, all classified as Trading account assets .\n                              165                               \nThe Company receives fees\nduring the course of servicing\npreviously securitized\nmortgages.

Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the three months ended\nJune 30, 2022 and 2021. These\nsecurities are backed by\neither residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of\nclients. As of June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, Citi\nheld noretained interests in\nprivate label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During\nthe three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2022, Citi\ntransferred agency securities\nwith a fair value of\napproximately $ 5.6billion and\n$ 14.9billion, respectively,\nto re-securitization entities\ncompared to approximately $\n11.4billion and $ 24.5billion\nfor the three and six months\nended June 30, 2021,\nrespectively. As of June 30,\n2022, the fair value of Citi-\nretained interests in agency\nre-securitization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.5billion\n(including $ 656million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in\n2022), an increase from $\n1.2billion as of December 31,\n2021 (including $ 641million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in\n2021), which is recorded in\nTrading account assets . The\noriginal fair values of agency\nre-securitization transactions\nin which Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of June 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021 were\napproximately $ 78.8billion\nand $ 78.4billion,\nrespectively. As of June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthe Company did not\nconsolidate any private label\nor agency re-securitization\nentities. Citi-Administered\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper\nConduits At June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the\ncommercial paper conduits\nadministered by Citi had\napproximately $ 14.3billion\nand $ 14billion of purchased\nassets outstanding,\nrespectively, and had\nincremental funding\ncommitments with clients of\napproximately $ 16.4billion\nand $ 18.3billion,\nrespectively.\n\nSubstantially all of the\nfunding of the conduits is in\nthe form of short-term\ncommercial paper. At June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthe weighted average remaining\nlives of the commercial paper\nissued by the conduits were\napproximately 61and 70days,\nrespectively. The primary\ncredit enhancement provided to\nthe conduit investors is in\nthe form of transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements\ndescribed above. Each asset\npurchased by the conduit is\nstructured with transaction-\nspecific credit enhancement\nfeatures provided by the\nthird-party client seller,\nincluding over-\ncollateralization, cash and\nexcess spread collateral\naccounts, direct recourse or\nthird-party guarantees. These\ncredit enhancements are sized\nwith the objective of\napproximating a credit rating\nof A or above, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. In\naddition to the transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements,\nthe conduits, other than the\ngovernment-guaranteed loan\nconduit, have obtained letters\nof credit from the Company,\nwhich equal at least 8% to 10%\nof the conduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The\nletters of credit provided by\nthe Company to the conduits\ntotal approximately $\n1.5billion and $ 1.3billion as\nof June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively. The\nnet result across multiseller\nconduits administered by the\nCompany is that, in the event\nthat defaulted assets exceed\nthe transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements described\nabove, any losses in each\nconduit are allocated first to\nthe Company and then to the\ncommercial paper investors. At\nJune 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, the Company owned $\n5.3billion and $ 4.9billion,\nrespectively, of the\ncommercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits. The\nCompany\u2019s investments were not\ndriven by market illiquidity\nand the Company is not\nobligated under any agreement\nto purchase the commercial\npaper issued by the conduits.\nCollateralized Loan\nObligations (CLOs) There were\nno new securitizations during\nthe three months ended June\n30, 2022 and 2021.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining\nto Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from market\nfluctuations (i.e., market\nrisk), counterparty failure\n\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or\nperiods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e.,\nliquidity risk), as well as\nany market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n

a\n\u201creference asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              168                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of June\n30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against\ngross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to\nenforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              169

For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\nCitigroup has executed a last-\nof-layer hedge, which permits\nan entity to hedge the\ninterest rate risk of a stated\nportion of a closed portfolio\nof prepayable financial assets\nthat are expected to remain\noutstanding for the designated\ntenor of the hedge. In\naccordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment\nrisk when measuring the change\nin fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk under the last-of-\nlayer approach. Similar to\nother fair value hedges, where\nthe hedged item is an asset,\nthe fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk will be presented in\nInterest revenue along with\nthe change in the fair value\nof the hedging instrument.\n\nHedging of Foreign Exchange\nRisk Citigroup hedges the\nchange in fair value\nattributable to foreign\nexchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt\nthat are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the\nentity holding the securities\nor issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nCitigroup considers the\npremium associated with\nforward contracts (i.e., the\ndifferential between the spot\nand contractual forward rates)\nas the cost of hedging; this\namount is excluded from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally\nreflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge.\nCiti also excludes changes in\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the value\nof the hedged inventory is\nreflected in earnings, which\noffsets the change in the fair\nvalue of the futures contract\nthat is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedging instrument recorded in\nearnings includes changes in\nforward rates, Citigroup\nexcludes the differential\nbetween the spot and the\ncontractual forward rates\nunder the futures contract\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, and it is\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in forward rates from\nthe assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income.\n                              172                               \nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the\nCompany\u2019s fair value hedges:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  1    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  1    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are\nincluded in Interest income/Interest expense .

either\npost additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021 was\n$ 18billion and $ 19billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 15billion and $\n16billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of June\n30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger\nadditional collateral or cash\nsettlement requirements for\nthe Company and certain\naffiliates. In the event that\nCitigroup and Citibank were\ndowngraded a single notch by\nall threemajor rating agencies\nas of June 30, 2022, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n1.1billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 0.1billion upon the\nsingle notch downgrade,\nresulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$ 1.2billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n2.0billion and $ 2.9billion as\nof June 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively. At\nJune 30, 2022, the fair value\nof these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n1.9billion. The fair value of\nthe total return swaps as of\nJune 30, 2022 was $ 19million\nrecorded as gross derivative\nassets and $ 83million\nrecorded as gross derivative\nliabilities. At December 31,\n2021, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 2.9billion, and the fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps was $ 13million recorded\nas gross derivative assets and\n$ 58million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              178                               \n20.

Statements\nin Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nFair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs\nbased on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are developed using market data and reflect\nmarket participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs\nreflect the Company\u2019s market assumptions. These two types of\ninputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level\n1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active and model-derived valuations in\nwhich all significant inputs and significant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable . As required under\nthe fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and\nobservable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The\nfair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes\nrules-based and data-driven selection criteria to determine\nwhether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level\n3: \u2022 The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is\nbased upon the frequency of observed transactions and the\nquality of independent market data available on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is\nobservability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The\ndetermination of whether an input is considered observable is\nbased on the availability of independent market data and its\ncorroboration, for example through observed transactions in the\nmarket. \u2022 Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.\n                              179                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis The\nfollowing tables present for\neach of the fair value\nhierarchy levels the Company\u2019s\nassets and liabilities that\nare measured at fair value on\na recurring basis at June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021.\nThe Company may hedge\npositions\n\nthat have been classified in\nthe Level 3 category with\nother financial instruments\n(hedging instruments) that may\nbe classified as Level 3, but\nalso with financial\ninstruments classified as\nLevel 1 or Level 2.

Of the $ 6.7billion\ntransfer in the six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately $\n4.5billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs\nbecoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their\noverall valuation, and $ 2.2billion related to equity and credit\nderivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g.,\ninterest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or\nsignificant to their overall valuation. In other instances,\nmarket changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more\nobservable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less\nsignificant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g.,\nwhen an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This\nhas primarily resulted in $ 2.6billion and $ 3.5billion of\ncertain structured long-term debt products being transferred\nfrom Level 3 to Level 2 during the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2022, respectively. The following were the significant\nLevel 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2020 to June 30,\n2021: \u2022 During the three and six months ended June 30, 2021,\ntransfers of Loans of $ 2.1billion from Level 3 to Level 2 were\nprimarily driven by equity forward and volatility inputs that\nhave been assessed as not significant to the overall valuation\nof certain hybrid loan instruments, including equity options and\nlong dated equity call spreads. \u2022 During the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021, transfers of Long-term debt were $\n3.9billion and $ 4.9billion, respectively, from Level 2 to Level\n3. Of the $ 4.9billion transfer in the six months ended June 30,\n2021, approximately $ 4.0billion related to interest option\nvolatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant\nrelative to their overall valuation, and $ 0.8billion related to\nequity volatility inputs (in addition to the other volatility\ninputs, e.g, interest rate volatility inputs) becoming\nunobservable and/or significant relative to their overall\nvaluation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in\nsome inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation\nof the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or\ndeep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $\n6.0billion of certain structured long-term debt products being\ntransferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021.\n                              191                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements The following tables present the valuation\ntechniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the\nmost significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements.

Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . Among other\nvariables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and\nsimilar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of\nthe Company\u2019s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair\nvalue of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in\nthe Company\u2019s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit\nrisk) were a gain of $ 2,592million and a loss of $ 110million\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nand a gain of $ 3,642million and a loss of $ 148million for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes\nin fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific\ncredit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s\ncurrent credit spreads observable in the bond market into the\nrelevant valuation technique used to value each liability as\ndescribed above. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and\nFinancial Liabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities\nPurchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed,\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities\nLoaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of\nfixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and\nfixed income securities sold under agreements to repurchase,\nsecurities borrowed, securities loaned and certain\nuncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-\ndealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and\nJapan. In each case, the election was made because the related\ninterest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily\nwith offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at\nfair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for\ntransactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal\ntransactions . The related interest revenue and interest expense\nare measured based on the contractual rates specified in the\ntransactions and are reported as Interest revenue and Interest\nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans\nand Other Credit Products Citigroup has also elected the fair\nvalue option for certain other originated and purchased loans,\nincluding certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and\nletters of credit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading\nbusinesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged\nfinancing commitments. Significant groups of transactions\ninclude loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be\neither sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions\nwhere the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments,\nsuch as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps\nwhere the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans\nto a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to\nmitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting\nis complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair\nvalue was not elected for most lending transactions across the\nCompany.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                                           Decemb\u2026              \n                June 30,                       31,              \n                    2022                      2021              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026        Trading       Loans       Trading       Loans  \n  of              assets                    assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $     7,655    $  4,536    $    9,530    $  6,082  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess             152         195          -100         226  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                \u2014         248             \u2014           1  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                \u2014           \u2014             \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              199                               \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 648million and $\n719million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Changes in\nthe fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are\nclassified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended June 30, 2022\nand 2021 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to\nlosses of $( 47) million and $( 2) million, respectively.\nChanges in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are\nestimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads\nand recovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its\ncommodity and foreign currency trading activities or to\neconomically hedge certain exposures from issuing structured\nliabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a\ndebt host contract and a commodity forward derivative\ninstrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt\nhost contract, and reports the debt host contract within Trading\naccount assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The\ntotal carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated\nprecious metals accounts was approximately $ 0.5billion and $\n0.3billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe amounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity\nin future periods. As part of its commodity and foreign currency\ntrading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals\ninvestments and executes forward purchase and forward sale\nderivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi\nsells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi\u2019s\nreceivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of June\n30, 2022, there were approximately $ 22.7billion and $\n15.9billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures\nCitigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for\nthe purpose of earning investment returns and for capital\nappreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for\ncertain of these ventures, because such investments are\nconsidered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)\nCitigroup has elected the fair value option for certain\npurchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming\nadjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are\nintended for sale or securitization and are hedged with\nderivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value\noption to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge\naccounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.\nThe following table provides information about certain mortgage\nloans HFS carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of              June 30,                          \n  dollars                         2022       December 31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the          $     1,375    $              3,035  \n  Consolidated Balance                                          \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggregate fair value                                          \n  in excess of (less               -46                      70  \n  than) unpaid                                                  \n  principal balance                                             \n  Balance of                                                    \n  non-accrual loans or                                          \n  loans                              5                       \u2014  \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past due                                                      \n  Aggregate unpaid                                              \n  principal balance in                                          \n  excess of fair value                                          \n  for non-accrual                    1                       \u2014  \n  loans or loans more                                           \n  than 90 days past                                             \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              200                               \nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are\nreported in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. There was no net change in fair value\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes\nin the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in\naddition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest\nincome continues to be measured based on the contractual\ninterest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Debt Liabilities The\nCompany has elected the fair value option for certain debt\nliabilities. The Company elected the fair value option because\nthese exposures are considered to be trading-related positions\nand, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These\npositions will continue to be classified as debt, deposits or\nderivatives classified as Trading account liabilities on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their legal\nform.\nThe following table provides information about the carrying\nvalue of notes carried at fair value, disaggregated by type of\nrisk:\n                                                                \n  In billions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                     June 30, 2022               2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest rate linked     $           43.9    $          38.9  \n  Foreign exchange                      0.1                  \u2014  \n  linked                                                        \n  Equity linked                        36.9               36.1  \n  Commodity linked                      4.7                3.9  \n  Credit linked                         3.8                3.7  \n  Total                    $           89.4    $          82.6  \n                                                                \nThe portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes\nin Citigroup\u2019s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a\ncomponent of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are\nreported in Principal transactions .

For certain\ncontracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum\npotential future payments is\nbased on the notional\n\namount of the guarantees\nwithout consideration of\npossible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As\nsuch, Citi believes such\namounts bear no relationship\nto the anticipated losses, if\nany, on these guarantees.

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be $ 126billion and $\n119billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants.\n                              202                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 16million and $ 19million at June\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and these amounts\nare included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of\nits credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide insurance coverage for rental\ncars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased\nproducts, price protection for certain purchases and protection\nfor lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the\ntable, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nactual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of\nCiti\u2019s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of June 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance\nIndemnification Citi has an indemnification contingency to\nBrighthouse Financial in connection with Citi\u2019s sale of an\ninsurance subsidiary. A liability under this indemnification\nagreement is currently remote because Brighthouse Financial\nwould become responsible for LTC policyholder claims only when\nboth the reinsurance provided by other parties ceases and trust\nassets set aside to meet these claims are not adequate. However,\nshould events occur causing both the reinsurance protection and\ntrust collateral to become insufficient to cover Brighthouse\nFinancial\u2019s LTC policyholder claims, Citi will be required to\neither estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range\nof loss to the extent that such an estimate can be made, or to\naccrue for such liability if the event becomes probable and\nestimable. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential\nexposure under this indemnification obligation. For additional\ninformation, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K. Futures and Over-the-\nCounter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on\ncentral clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi\nhas concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes\nin its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 19 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually\nagreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\n                              203                               \nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 19.5billion and $ 18.7billion as of June 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Variation margin due\nfrom clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients,\nreflects changes in the value of the client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is\nexposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure\nof a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In\nthe event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to\nclose out the client\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically\nutilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP,\nwith any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as\nclearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or\nsecurities margin posted by the client, which would typically be\nexpected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the\nevent the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At June 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.4billion and $\n1.4billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 66.3billion and $\n56.5billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 77.2billion and $ 84.2billion at June\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities\nlending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in\nfavor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 4.2billion and $\n4.1billion at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nOther property may also be available to Citi to cover losses\nunder certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the\nvalue of such property has not been determined.\n                              204                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n

Unsettled Reverse\nRepurchase and Securities\nBorrowing Agreements and\nUnsettled Repurchase and\nSecurities Lending Agreements\nIn addition, in the normal\ncourse of business, Citigroup\nenters into reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date.

For purposes of this\nNote, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory, or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At June 30, 2022,\nCitigroup estimates that the\nreasonably possible unaccrued\nloss for these matters ranges\nup to approximately $\n1.2billion in the aggregate.\nAs available information\nchanges, the matters for which\nCitigroup is able to estimate\nwill change, and the estimates\nthemselves will change. In\naddition, while many estimates\npresented in financial\nstatements and other financial\ndisclosures involve\nsignificant judgment and may\nbe subject to significant\nuncertainty, estimates of the\nrange of reasonably possible\nloss arising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued in\nrelation to matters for which\nan estimate has been made\ncould be substantially higher\nor lower than the range of\nloss included in the estimate.\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters\ndescribed in this Note would\nnot be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and\n\nthe inherent unpredictability\nof such matters, an adverse\noutcome in certain of these\nmatters could, from time to\ntime, have a material adverse\neffect on Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated results of\noperations or cash flows in\nparticular quarterly or annual\nperiods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.
