(Citi) Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee)\napproved incentive compensation awards for 2022 performance to\nCiti's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jane Fraser. In setting Ms.\nFraser's incentive compensation for 2022, the Compensation\nCommittee considered Ms. Fraser's individual performance,\nincluding the following highlights:\n                                                                \n     2022 was Ms. Fraser\u2019s first full calendar year as our      \n     CEO. She has established a clear set of priorities for     \n     Citi to increase shareholder value over time. These        \n  \u25cf  priorities are Citi\u2019s Transformation, Strategic Refresh,   \n     and Improved Culture and Talent. Execution of this         \n     strategy will generate improved returns over the           \n     medium-term.                                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Notwithstanding challenging macroeconomic and              \n     geopolitical developments, under Ms. Fraser\u2019s leadership   \n  \u25cf  Citi made solid progress on each of our priorities, and    \n     the Compensation Committee recognizes the strategic        \n     direction that took shape during 2022.                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Two of our major goals for 2022 were to put a strategic    \n     plan in place focused on five interconnected businesses    \n  o  designed to create long-term value for our shareholders    \n     and to simplify the firm. We made significant progress     \n     during 2022 towards these goals by:                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      Closing sales of five consumer businesses in Australia,   \n  \u25fe  the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Bahrain,          \n      including three in the fourth quarter of 2022.            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n      Making substantial progress in winding down our consumer  \n  \u25fe  business in Korea, reducing our overall exposure in       \n      Russia, and announcing the wind down of our consumer      \n      business in China.                                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u25fe  Signing four additional consumer markets sales in 2022    \n      and working towards closing those in 2023.                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u25fe  Re-segmenting the organization to align with Citi\u2019s       \n      strategy.                                                 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     During 2022 we also brought in very strong talent, met     \n  o  our representation goals, and strengthened our culture of  \n     enhanced accountability, excellence, and shareholder       \n     alignment across Citi.                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Citi\u2019s CEO has made the strengthening of Citi\u2019s risk and   \n     control environment a strategic priority, and as a result  \n  o  of work to date, management has made progress on           \n     addressing the primary drivers of our risk management      \n     issues.                                                    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     In addition to the foregoing, an ongoing priority for      \n     Citi management is the remediation of the issues           \n     identified in the Consent Orders issued in 2020 by the     \n     Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller    \n     of the Currency.
