Certain\nreclassifications have been\nmade to the prior periods\u2019\nfinancial statements and\ndisclosures to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation,\nincluding certain\nreclassifications to align\nwith Citi\u2019s organizational\nsimplification and strategy,\nfor all periods presented.\nPlease see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nbelow for a discussion of\nmaterial risks and\nuncertainties that could\nimpact Citigroup\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Citi prepares its financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or\notherwise include components that differ from the most directly\ncomparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a\nsubstitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or\ncalculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar names\nused by other companies. Citi\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures in\nthis Form 10-K include: \u2022 Revenues excluding the Argentina\ncurrency devaluation and/or divestiture-related impacts \u2022\nExpenses excluding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) special assessment and/or divestiture-related impacts \u2022\nServices and Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) revenues and/or\nnon-interest revenues excluding the impact of the Argentina\ncurrency devaluation \u2022 Banking and Corporate Lending revenues\nexcluding gain (loss) on loan hedges \u2022 All Other (managed\nbasis), which excludes divestiture-related impacts \u2022 Tangible\ncommon equity (TCE), return on tangible common equity (RoTCE)\nand tangible book value per share (TBVPS) \u2022 Non- Markets net\ninterest income For more information on the Argentina currency\ndevaluation and/or the FDIC special assessment, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d below. Citi believes its results excluding the\nArgentina currency devaluation and the FDIC special assessment\nare useful to investors, industry analysts and others in\nevaluating Citi\u2019s results of operations and comparing its\noperational performance between periods, by providing a\nmeaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-\nto-period operating results, particularly given the outsized\nimpacts of these items, as well as additional comparability to\npeer companies. Citi\u2019s results excluding divestiture-related\nimpacts represent as reported, or GAAP, financial results\nadjusted for items that are incurred and recognized, which are\nwholly and necessarily a consequence of actions taken to sell\n(including through a public offering), dispose of or wind down\nbusiness activities associated with Citi\u2019s previously announced\nexit markets within All Other \u2014Legacy Franchises. Citi\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, regularly\nreviews financial information for All Other on a managed basis\nthat excludes these divestiture-related impacts. For more\ninformation on Citi\u2019s results excluding divestiture- related\nimpacts, see \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and \u201c All Other \u2014 Divestiture-\nRelated Impacts (Reconciling Items)\u201d below. Citi believes its\nresults excluding divestiture-related impacts are useful to\ninvestors, industry analysts and others in evaluating Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and comparing its operational performance\nbetween periods, by providing a meaningful depiction of the\nunderlying fundamentals of\n                               4                                \nperiod-to-period operating\nresults, particularly given\nthe outsized impacts of the\ndivestiture-related impacts;\nimproved visibility into\nmanagement decisions and their\nimpacts on operational\nperformance; and additional\ncomparability to peer\ncompanies.\n\nFor more information on\nServices and TTS revenues\nand/or non-interest revenues\nexcluding the impact of the\nArgentina currency\ndevaluation, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and \u201c Services \u201d\nbelow.\n\nFor more information on\nBanking and Corporate Lending\nrevenues excluding gain (loss)\non loan hedges, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and \u201cBanking\u201d below.\nCiti believes that Banking and\nCorporate Lending revenues\nexcluding gain (loss) on loan\nhedges are useful to\ninvestors, industry analysts\nand others because the gain\n(loss) on loan hedges are\nindependent of Banking and\nCorporate Lending\u2019s core\noperations and not indicative\nof the performance of the\nbusiness operations.\n\nFor more information on TCE,\nRoTCE and TBVPS, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Tangible Common\nEquity, Book Value Per Share,\nTangible Book Value Per Share\nand Return on Equity\u201d below.\nTCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are used\nby management, as well as\ninvestors, industry analysts\nand others, in assessing\nCiti\u2019s use of equity. Citi\nbelieves TCE and RoTCE are\nuseful to investors, industry\nanalysts and others by\nproviding alternative measures\nof capital strength and\nperformance. Citi believes\nTBVPS provides additional\nuseful information about the\nlevel of tangible assets in\nrelation to Citi\u2019s outstanding\nshares of common stock.\n\nFor more information on non-\nMarkets net interest income,\nsee \u201cMarket Risk\u2014Non- Markets\nNet Interest Income\u201d below.\nManagement uses non- Markets\nnet interest income to assess\nthe performance of Citi\u2019s\nlending, investing (including\nasset-liability management)\nand deposit-raising\nactivities, apart from any\nvolatility associated with\nMarkets activities. Citi\nbelieves the use of this non-\nGAAP measure provides\ninvestors, industry analysts\nand others with an alternative\nmeasure to analyze the net\ninterest income trends of\nCiti\u2019s lending, investing and\ndeposit-raising activities, by\nproviding a meaningful\ndepiction of the underlying\nfundamentals of period-to-\nperiod operating results of\nthose activities; improved\nvisibility into management\ndecisions and their impacts on\noperational performance; and\nadditional comparability to\npeer companies.\n                               5                                \nCitigroup is managed pursuant to five operating segments:\nServices , Markets , Banking , Wealth and U.S. Personal Banking.\nActivities not assigned to the operating segments are included\nin All Other .

Citi\u2019s\npositive operating leverage in\n2024 was driven by revenue\ngrowth of 3%, with record\nrevenues in Services , Wealth\nand USPB , and disciplined\nexpense management (down 4%),\ndespite higher volume- and\ntransformation-related\nexpenses and other investments\nin risk and control\ninitiatives. Excluding the\nimpact of the FDIC special\nassessment in both 2024 and\nthe prior year, expenses\ndecreased 2%.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to advance\nits transformation, including\nits efforts to improve risk\nmanagement, modernize\ntechnology and infrastructure\nand improve resiliency across\nthe organization.\nSimultaneously, as a result of\nthe July 2024 Civil Money\nPenalty Consent Orders and\nConsent Order Amendment, Citi\nrecognized the need to\naccelerate progress in certain\nareas, particularly with\nregard to data quality\nmanagement related to\ngovernance and regulatory\nreporting. (See \u201cCiti\u2019s\nMultiyear Transformation\u201d\nbelow).\n\n\u2022 Citi completed its\norganizational simplification\nannounced in September 2023,\nresulting in a simpler\nmanagement structure that\naligns to and facilitates\nCiti\u2019s strategy, while\nimproving accountability and\ndecision-making and advancing\nthe execution of Citi\u2019s\ntransformation.\n\n\u2022 As part of its strategic\nrefresh, Citi continued to\nmake progress on its remaining\ndivestitures, including exits\nof its consumer banking\noperations in Korea and Poland\nand its overall operations in\nRussia. Additionally, Citi\ncompleted the separation of\nits Services , Markets ,\nBanking and Wealth businesses\nin Mexico from its consumer\nbanking and small business and\nmiddle-market banking\noperations in Mexico (Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM) in December\n2024, an important milestone\ntoward the planned initial\npublic offering (IPO) of\nCiti\u2019s Mexico Consumer/SBMM\nbusiness. (See \u201c All Other\n(Managed Basis)\u201d below.)\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $6.7 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends ($4.2\nbillion) and share repurchases\n($2.5 billion) in 2024. As\npreviously disclosed, on\nJanuary 13, 2025, Citigroup\u2019s\nBoard of Directors authorized\na new, multiyear $20 billion\ncommon stock repurchase\nprogram, with planned\nrepurchases of $1.5 billion\nduring the first quarter of\n2025, subject to market\nconditions and other factors.\nAfter the first quarter of\n2025, Citi will continue to\nassess the level of common\nshare repurchases on a\nquarter-by-quarter basis given\nuncertainty regarding\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, among other\nfactors.\n                                                                \n  2024 Results Summary                                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $12.7 billion, or $5.94 per\nshare. This compared to net\nincome of $9.2 billion, or\n$4.04 per share in the prior\nyear, which included larger\nimpacts from certain notable\nitems, including an Argentina\ncurrency devaluation, an FDIC\nspecial assessment,\nrestructuring charges related\nto Citi\u2019s organizational\nsimplification and an ACL\nbuild for transfer risk (see\n\u201cCost of Credit\u201d below).\n\nNet income increased 37%\nversus the prior year, driven\nby the higher revenues, lower\nexpenses and a lower effective\ntax rate, partially offset by\nhigher cost of credit.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nwas 25% in 2024 versus 27% in\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby the geographic mix of\nearnings (see Note 10).\n\nCitigroup revenues of $81.1\nbillion in 2024 increased 3%\non a reported basis. This\nincrease in revenues largely\nreflected an increase in non-\ninterest revenue (up 15%),\nincluding the benefit of a\nsmaller impact from the\nArgentina currency devaluation\n($(253) million in 2024 versus\napproximately $(1.9) billion\nin 2023) as well as strength\nin underlying fee drivers in\neach of Citi\u2019s reportable\noperating segments. The\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue was partially offset\nby a decline in net interest\nincome (down 1%). The decrease\nin net interest income\nprimarily reflected lower\nrevenues in All Other (managed\nbasis), partially offset by\nhigher interest-earning\nbalance growth in U.S.\nPersonal Banking (USPB) .\nExcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts, primarily related to\ngains on the sales of Citi\u2019s\nIndia and Taiwan consumer\nbanking businesses in the\nprior year, as well as the\nArgentina currency\ndevaluation, revenues of $81.4\nbillion in 2024 also increased\n3% versus the prior year.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $694 billion, up 1%\nversus the prior year, largely\ndriven by loan growth in USPB\n.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were approximately\n$1.3 trillion, down 2% versus\nthe prior year, largely due to\na decrease in All Other\n(managed basis). For\nadditional information about\nCiti\u2019s deposits by business,\nincluding drivers and deposit\ntrends, see each respective\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations and \u201cLiquidity\nRisk\u2014 Deposits\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s operating expenses\nof $54.0 billion decreased 4%\nfrom the prior year. Excluding\nthe FDIC special assessment\n($203 million in 2024 versus\napproximately $1.7 billion in\nthe prior year), expenses of\n$53.8 billion decreased 2%,\ndriven by savings related to\nCiti\u2019s organizational\nsimplification and stranded\ncost reduction, as well as the\nlower restructuring charges\n($259 million in 2024 versus\n$781 million in the prior\nyear) and repositioning costs.\nThe decrease was partially\noffset by higher volume-\nrelated expenses, investments\nin Citi\u2019s transformation and\nother risk and controls\ninitiatives, as well as the\ncosts of the July 2024 Civil\nMoney Penalty Consent Orders\nentered into with the Federal\nReserve Board (FRB) and the\nOffice of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (OCC).\n                               7                                \nExcluding the FDIC special\nassessment and divestiture-\nrelated impacts, expenses of\n$53.5 billion also decreased\n2%.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was $10.1 billion,\ncompared to $9.2 billion in\nthe prior year. The increase\nwas driven by higher net\ncredit losses in Branded Cards\nand Retail Services in USPB ,\nreflecting the continued\nmaturation of multiple cards\nloan vintages originated in\nrecent years. The maturation\nwas delayed by unprecedented\nlevels of government stimulus\nduring the pandemic. In\naddition, the increase was due\nto macroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncard portfolios, with lower\nFICO band customers primarily\ndriving the increase. The\nhigher net credit losses were\npartially offset by a lower\nnet build in the allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL), primarily\ndue to a smaller build related\nto transfer risk associated\nwith exposures outside the\nU.S. (approximately $0.2\nbillion in 2024 versus $1.9\nbillion in 2023), driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Citi\u2019s Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $9.0\nbillion increased 40% from the\nprior year. Consumer net\ncredit losses of $8.6 billion\nincreased 39%, largely\nreflecting the continued rise\nin net credit loss rates in\nBranded Cards and Retail\nServices. Corporate net credit\nlosses increased to $397\nmillion from $250 million in\nthe prior year.\n\nSubject to evolving\nmacroeconomic conditions, Citi\nexpects to continue to\nexperience an elevated net\ncredit loss rate for full-year\n2025 in line with 2024, with\nhigher loss rates in the first\nhalf of the year in Branded\nCards and Retail Services\nconsistent with seasonal\npatterns. Citi also expects\nthat its future ACL builds\nwill be driven by both the\nmacroeconomic environment and\nbusiness volumes, among other\nfactors. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s consumer\nand corporate credit costs,\nsee each respective business\u2019s\nresults of operations and\n\u201cCredit Risk\u201d below.\n\nIn January 2025, a series of\nwildfires affected the Los\nAngeles metropolitan area and\nsurrounding regions, causing\nloss of life and the\ndestruction of more than\n16,000 structures. While Citi\ncontinues to assess the\nwildfires\u2019 impact on its\ncustomers and clients in the\naffected areas, Citi does not\ncurrently expect the wildfires\nto have a direct material\nimpact to its consumer or\ncorporate credit portfolios or\nits overall results of\noperations.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 13.6% as of December 31,\n2024, compared to 13.4% as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk\nweighted assets (RWA). The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby net income and a decrease\nin RWA, partially offset by\nthe payment of common and\npreferred dividends, as well\nas common share repurchases\nand net adverse movements in\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (AOCI) .\n\nIn 2024, Citi repurchased $2.5\nbillion of common shares and\npaid $4.2 billion of common\ndividends (see \u201cUnregistered\n\nSales of Equity Securities,\nRepurchases of Equity\nSecurities and Dividends\u201d\nbelow).\n\nFor additional information on\ncapital-related risks, trends\nand uncertainties, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards and\nDevelopments\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks,\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Operational Risks\u201d and\n\u201c\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d below.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of\n\nDecember 31, 2024 was 5.8%,\nlargely unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2023, as higher\nTier 1 Capital was offset by\nan increase in Total Leverage\nExposure.

Excluding the impact of\nthe Argentina currency\ndevaluation ($(178) million in\n2024 versus approximately\n$(1.2) billion in 2023),\nServices revenues increased 3%\nand its non-interest revenue\nincreased 5%. The increase in\nnet interest income reflected\nthe benefit of higher deposit\nand loan volumes, largely\noffset by a decline in\ninterest rates in Argentina.\n\nTTS revenues of $14.5 billion\nincreased 6% on a reported\nbasis, driven by a 37%\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue, partially offset by a\n1% decrease in net interest\nincome. Excluding the impact\nof the Argentina currency\ndevaluation (approximately\n$(164) million in 2024 and\napproximately $(1.0) billion\nin 2023), non-interest revenue\nincreased 3%, driven by an\nincrease in cross-border\ntransaction value, as well as\nan increase in U.S. dollar\nclearing and commercial card\nspend volume. The decrease in\nTTS net interest income was\nprimarily driven by the\ndecline in interest rates in\nArgentina.\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nof $5.1 billion increased 17%,\ndriven by an 18% increase in\nnon-interest revenue and a 15%\nincrease in net interest\nincome. The growth in non-\ninterest revenue was primarily\ndue to increased fees from\nhigher AUC/AUA balances and\ncontinued elevated levels of\ncorporate activity in Issuer\nServices, as well as the\nsmaller impact from the\ncurrency devaluation in\nArgentina. The increase in net\ninterest income was primarily\ndue to higher spreads and\nvolumes.\n\nServices expenses of $10.6\nbillion increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in technology and\nplatform modernization, other\nrisk and controls and product\ninnovation, as well as an\nArgentina-related transaction\ntax expense and higher legal\nexpenses, partially offset by\nthe impact of productivity\nsavings. Cost of credit\ndecreased to $276 million from\n$950 million in the prior\nyear, primarily driven by a\nsmaller ACL build for transfer\nrisk associated with exposures\noutside of the U.S., driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nServices in 2024, see \u201c\nServices \u201d below.\n                               8                                \n                                                                \n  Markets                                                       \n                                                                \nMarkets net income of $4.9\nbillion increased 27%, driven\nby higher revenues, partially\noffset by higher cost of\ncredit.\n\nMarkets revenues of $19.8\nbillion increased 6%, driven\nby a 26% increase in Equity\nMarkets and a 1% increase in\nFixed Income Markets. The\nincrease in Equity Markets was\nprimarily driven by growth in\ncash equities, due to higher\nclient activity and volumes,\nand equity derivatives on\nhigher volatility, which also\nincluded the impact from an\nepisodic gain related to the\nVisa B exchange. The increase\nwas also driven by an increase\nin prime services. The\nincrease in Fixed Income\nMarkets was driven by growth\nin spread products and other\nfixed income (up 20%),\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in rates and\ncurrencies (down 6%). The\nincrease in spread products\nand other fixed income\nrevenues was largely driven by\nincreased client activity due\nto growth in asset-backed\nfinancing, securitization\nactivity and underwriting\nfees, partially offset by a\ndecline in commodities\nrevenues. The decline in rates\nand currencies revenues was\nprimarily due to lower\nvolatility and a strong prior-\nyear performance, partially\noffset by the smaller impact\nof the Argentina currency\ndevaluation.\n\nMarkets expenses of $13.2\nbillion were largely unchanged\nversus the prior year, as\nhigher legal and volume-\nrelated expenses were offset\nby productivity savings. Cost\nof credit increased to $463\nmillion from $438 million in\nthe prior year, primarily\ndriven by higher net credit\nlosses for loans in spread\nproducts, partially offset by\na smaller ACL build on other\nassets for transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S., driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nMarkets in 2024, see \u201c Markets\n\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Banking                                                       \n                                                                \nBanking net income was $1.5\nbillion, compared to a net\nloss of $35 million in the\nprior year, driven by higher\nrevenues, lower expenses and a\nhigher benefit from cost of\ncredit.\n\nBanking revenues of $6.2\nbillion increased 32%,\nincluding a $180 million loss\non loan hedges in 2024 versus\na $443 million loss on loan\nhedges in the prior year.\nExcluding the losses on loan\nhedges, Banking revenues of\n$6.4 billion increased 24%,\nreflecting higher Investment\nBanking and Corporate Lending\nrevenues. Investment Banking\nrevenues of $3.6 billion\nincreased 38%, due to a\nrebound in overall wallet\nactivity and wallet share\ngains across all products.\nCorporate Lending revenues\nincreased 23%, including the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges. Excluding the impact\nof losses on loan hedges,\nCorporate Lending revenues\nincreased 9%, primarily driven\nby a smaller impact from the\nArgentina currency\ndevaluation.\n\nBanking expenses of $4.5\nbillion decreased 8%,\nprimarily driven by benefits\nof prior repositioning and\nother actions to lower the\nexpense base, partially offset\nby higher volume-related\nexpenses. Cost of credit was a\nbenefit of $224 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $143\nmillion in the prior year,\ndriven by an ACL release on\nother assets, primarily due to\nlower transfer risk associated\nwith exposures outside the\nU.S., driven by safety and\nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nBanking in 2024, see \u201c Banking\n\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Wealth                                                        \n                                                                \nWealth net income of $1.0\nbillion increased 139%,\nreflecting higher revenues,\nlower expenses and a higher\nbenefit from cost of credit.\n\nWealth revenues of $7.5\nbillion increased 7%, largely\ndriven by higher non-interest\nrevenue (up 15%), reflecting\nhigher investment fee revenues\nin Citigold, Wealth at Work\nand the Private Bank on growth\nin client investment assets,\nas well as an increase in net\ninterest income (up 2%). The\nincrease in net interest\nincome was mainly due to\nhigher average deposit spreads\nand volumes, partially offset\nby higher mortgage funding\ncosts in the Private Bank and\nWealth at Work.\n\nWealth expenses decreased 2%\nto $6.4 billion, primarily\ndriven by benefits from prior\nrepositioning and\nrestructuring actions,\npartially offset by higher\nvolume-related expenses and\ntechnology investments focused\non risk and controls and\nplatform enhancements. Cost of\ncredit was a net benefit of\n$126 million, compared to a\nnet benefit of $3 million in\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby a higher net ACL release\ndue to a change in the ACL\nassociated with the margin\nlending portfolio.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nWealth in 2024, see \u201c Wealth \u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  U.S. Personal Banking                                         \n                                                                \nUSPB net income of $1.4\nbillion decreased 24%, driven\nby higher cost of credit,\npartially offset by higher\nrevenues and lower expenses.\n\nUSPB revenues of $20.4 billion\nincreased 6%, due to higher\nnet interest income (up 5%),\ndriven by strong loan growth,\nprimarily in cards, as well as\nhigher non-interest revenue\n(up 24%) due to lower partner\npayments in Retail Services.\nBranded Cards revenues of\n$10.7 billion increased 7%,\nprimarily driven by higher net\ninterest income, reflecting\ninterest-earning balance\ngrowth (up 9%) from lower\npayment rates and card spend\nvolume growth. Retail Services\nrevenues of $7.1 billion\nincreased 8%, primarily driven\nby higher non-interest revenue\ndue to the lower partner\npayments, as a result of\nhigher net credit losses, as\nwell as higher net interest\nincome on growth in interest-\nearning balances (up 3%).\nRetail Banking revenues of\n$2.6 billion decreased 1%,\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof the transfers of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nWealth , partially offset by\nhigher deposit spreads, as\nwell as mortgage and\ninstallment loan growth.\n\nUSPB expenses of $10 billion\ndecreased 1%, primarily driven\nby continued productivity\nsavings and lower technology\ncosts, partially offset by\nhigher volume-related\nexpenses. Cost of credit\nincreased to $8.6 billion,\ncompared to $6.7 billion in\nthe prior year. The increase\nwas driven by higher net\ncredit losses (up 45%),\nprimarily reflecting the\ncontinued maturation of\nmultiple cards loan vintages\noriginated in recent years, as\nwell as macroeconomic\npressures related to the\nelevated inflationary and\ninterest rate environment\nimpacting both cards\nportfolios, with lower FICO\nband customers primarily\ndriving the increase.

The decline in\nCorporate/Other was largely\ndriven by net investment\nsecurities losses due to the\nrepositioning of the\ninvestment securities\nportfolio and higher funding\ncosts. Legacy Franchises\n(managed basis) revenues\ndeclined 6%, due to lower\nrevenues in Asia Consumer\n(managed basis) and Legacy\nHoldings Assets, partially\noffset by higher revenues in\nMexico Consumer/SBMM (managed\nbasis).\n\nAll Other (managed basis)\nexpenses decreased 19%,\nprimarily driven by the lower\nFDIC special assessment ($203\nmillion in 2024 versus\napproximately $1.7 billion in\nthe prior year) and a\nreduction from the closed\nexits and wind-downs, as well\nas the lower restructuring\ncharges ($259 million in 2024\nversus $781 million in 2023),\npartially offset by the civil\nmoney penalties imposed by the\nFRB and OCC in July 2024. Cost\nof credit was $1.1 billion,\ncompared to $1.3 billion in\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby a smaller ACL build for\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S.,\ndriven by safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nAll Other (managed basis) in\n2024, see \u201c All Other\n\u2014Divestiture-Related Impacts\n(Reconciling Items)\u201d and \u201c All\nOther (Managed Basis)\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties               \n                                                                \nVarious macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and regulatory\nuncertainties and challenges\npose risks to economic\nconditions in the U.S. and\nglobally, including, among\nothers, any resurgence in\ninflation; changes to trade,\nimmigration, energy and other\npolicies resulting from the\nnew U.S. administration;\nchanges in interest rate\npolicies; the Russia\u2013Ukraine\nwar; conflicts in the Middle\nEast; and economic conditions\nand tensions involving China.\n\nFor example, on February 1,\n2025 the new U.S.\nadministration announced the\nimposition of new tariffs on\nimports from China, Mexico and\nCanada, although the tariffs\nfor Mexico and Canada were\ndelayed for 30 days. China\nresponded with tariffs against\ncertain imports from the U.S.\nAdditionally, on February 10,\n2025, the U.S. administration\nannounced global 25% tariffs\non steel and aluminum imports.\nThe U.S. administration has\nalso announced plans for\nreciprocal tariffs on all U.S.\ntrading partners. While the\nresulting impacts are\ndifficult to predict at this\ntime, these and other tariffs,\nwhether imposed by the U.S. or\nby any other country, may\nresult in disruption of supply\nchains, increased inflationary\npressures and higher interest\nrates.\n\nThese and other risks could\nnegatively impact economic\ngrowth rates and unemployment\nlevels in the U.S. and other\ncountries and result in\nvolatility and disruptions in\nfinancial markets. Such risks\ncould also adversely affect\nCiti\u2019s customers, clients,\nbusinesses, funding costs,\ncost of credit and overall\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition during\n2025.

As discussed in the\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d above, on\nJuly 10, 2024, the FRB entered\ninto a Civil Money Penalty\nConsent Order with Citigroup,\nand the OCC entered into a\nCivil Money Penalty Consent\nOrder with Citibank\n(collectively, the 2024\nConsent Orders). In addition,\nthe OCC and Citibank entered\ninto an Amendment (the\nAmendment) to the October 7,\n2020 Consent Order. For\nadditional information about\nthe 2024 Consent Orders and\nthe Amendment, see Citi\u2019s July\n10, 2024 Form 8-K and\n\u201cTransformation Focus Areas\nand Status\u201d and \u201cFRB and OCC\nConsent Orders Compliance\u201d\nbelow.\n\nCiti may continue to\nexperience significant\nchallenges in progressing the\ntransformation and satisfying\nthe regulators\u2019 expectations\nin both sufficiency and\ntiming, particularly with\nregard to data quality\nmanagement related to\ngovernance and regulatory\nreporting. The regulators may\nalso identify additional risk\nand control issues that could\nresult in further regulatory\nactions. For additional\ninformation about these\nregulatory risks, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d\nbelow.\n\nNotwithstanding the 2024\nConsent Orders and the\nAmendment, Citi\u2019s\ntransformation target outcomes\nremain focused on changing its\nbusiness and operating models\nsuch that they simultaneously\n(i) strengthen controls,\nenhance data quality, reduce\nrisk and improve Citi\u2019s\nregulatory compliance and its\nculture, and (ii) enhance\nCiti\u2019s value to customers,\nclients and shareholders.\n                                                                \n  Transformation Focus Areas and Status                         \n                                                                \nOver the last several years,\nCiti has made key investments\nto, among other things,\nconsolidate and modernize its\ninfrastructure, simplify and\nautomate manual processes, and\nenhance technology, data and\nanalytics. In particular,\nCiti\u2019s transformation-related\nexpenses include costs related\nto risk and controls, data and\nfinance programs and other\n2020 Consent Order programs,\nas well as spending on certain\nother regulatory initiatives\nunrelated to the 2020 Consent\nOrders, and spending on\nenterprise-wide technology\ninfrastructure and the\nTransformation Bonus Program\n(see below).\n\nCiti completed significant\nplanning and foundational work\nfor the transformation in 2021\nand 2022. In 2023, Citi\nprogressed its transformation\nefforts into implementation\nmode and those efforts\ncontinued in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, Citi\u2019s\ntransformation-related\nexpenses increased 1% to\napproximately $2.9 billion\nfrom the prior year, largely\ndriven by increased spending\non certain programs, including\ndata, largely offset by a\nreduction in the payout under\nthe Transformation Bonus\nProgram.\n\nCiti\u2019s transformation\ninitiatives will continue to\nentail significant investments\nduring 2025 and beyond. Citi\u2019s\ntransformation initiatives in\n2025 will continue to focus on\n(i) automating regulatory\nprocesses and remediating data\nquality issues, particularly\nrelated to regulatory\nreporting, and (ii) further\nstrengthening stress testing\nand resolution and recovery\ncapabilities.\n                                                                \n  Progress                                                      \n                                                                \nNotwithstanding Citi\u2019s\ninvestments and remediation\nefforts, as set forth in the\nFRB\u2019s 2024 Civil Money Penalty\nConsent Order, the FRB found\nthat, based on examinations\nconducted by the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York,\nCitigroup had ongoing\ndeficiencies related to its\ndata quality management\nprogram and inadequate\nmeasures for managing and\ncontrolling its data quality\nrisks. In addition, as set\nforth in the OCC\u2019s 2024 Civil\nMoney Penalty Consent Order\nand the Amendment, the OCC\ndeemed that Citibank had\nfailed to make sufficient and\nsustainable progress toward\nachieving compliance with the\nOCC\u2019s 2020 Consent Order. As a\nresult, Citi has made changes\nto its governance and\nstructure of its data program\nas well as increased the level\nof investment in the program.\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s transformation\ninvestments, see\n\u201cTransformation Focus Areas\nand Status\u201d above.\n\nDespite the ongoing regulatory\nchallenges and risks, Citi\u2019s\ntransformation progress\nincludes the following:\n\nImproved Risk Management\n\n\u2022 Closed the 2013 Consent\nOrder with the FRB related to\nanti-money laundering and Bank\nSecrecy Act deficiencies\n\n\u2022 Built greater efficiency and\nscale in the risk management\nof Citi\u2019s global spread\nproducts business, with 99% of\nrisk computations now\noccurring on cloud-based\ninfrastructure\n\n\u2022 Approximately 90% of\nderivative trades now subject\nto full revaluation each month\nusing automated independent\nprice verification\n\n\u2022 Approximately 76% of all\nproduct data onboarded to\nstrategic data redistribution\nplatforms with stronger data\nquality controls\n\n\u2022 Consolidated four new\nactivity risk management\nplatforms into one modern\nplatform\n\n\u2022 Implemented key technology\ncapabilities for target state\nwholesale credit analysis,\nsimplifying the process and\nexecution of policy\nrequirements\n\n\u2022 Faster and more frequent\nstress testing for\ngeopolitical risks, natural\ndisasters and industry-\nspecific events\n\nModernization\n\n\u2022 Retired or replaced 714\nlegacy applications in 2024\nwith new, modern applications\n\n\u2022 Launched a new regulatory\nreporting platform with\nadvanced capabilities to\nimprove quality and efficiency\n                               11                               \n\u2022 Scaled automated controls in\nMarkets , including\ntransaction monitoring (over\n750 million trading records\nmonthly) and Regulation W\ncompliance (approximately\n400,000 transactions monthly)\n\n\u2022 Consolidated 20 cash\nequities platforms into one\nmodern platform\n\n\u2022 Reduced time to book new or\namended loans in North America\nby over 50%\n\nResiliency\n\n\u2022 Improved resiliency and\nreduced downtime by\nsimplifying system restoration\nto a single click for\napproximately 26% of critical\napplications\n\n\u2022 Reduced data center\nconsumption through migration\nof workload to a private cloud\nand streamlined and reduced\nthe time involved in the cloud\nonboarding process from over\nseven weeks to two weeks\n\n\u2022 Upgraded 100% of Citi\u2019s more\nthan 2,300 ATMs in North\nAmerica, Singapore, Hong Kong\nand the UAE to next-generation\nsoftware for better customer\nsecurity and monitoring\n                                                                \n  Organizational Simplification                                 \n                                                                \nDuring the first quarter of\n2024, Citi completed its\norganizational simplification\nannounced in September 2023.\nThe result is a simpler\nmanagement structure that\naligns to and facilitates\nCiti\u2019s strategy, while\nimproving accountability and\ndecision-making. Citi\u2019s\noperating model changes\nincluded elimination of the\nInstitutional Clients Group ,\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement and Legacy\nFranchises operating segments\nand resulted in the five\ncurrent reportable operating\nsegments\u2014 Services , Markets ,\nBanking , Wealth and U.S.\nPersonal Banking \u2014and a new\nfinancial reporting structure.\nActivities not assigned to the\nreportable operating segments\nare reflected in All Other ,\nincluding Legacy Franchises\nand Corporate/Other. Citi also\nexited certain institutional\nbusiness lines and\nconsolidated its regional\nstructure from four to two\nregions, consisting of North\nAmerica and International.\nCiti\u2019s organizational\nsimplification efforts also\nassist in advancing the\nexecution of the\ntransformation.\n                                                                \n  FRB and OCC Consent Orders Compliance                         \n                                                                \nAs previously disclosed, on\nJuly 10, 2024, the FRB entered\ninto a Civil Money Penalty\nConsent Order with Citigroup\nin the amount of approximately\n$61 million, and the OCC\nentered into a Civil Money\nPenalty Consent Order with\nCitibank, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Citigroup, in\nthe amount of $75 million. The\nOCC and Citibank also entered\ninto an Amendment to the\nOctober 7, 2020 OCC Consent\nOrder. The Amendment requires\nCitibank to formalize a\nprocess to determine whether\nsufficient resources are being\nappropriately allocated toward\nachieving timely and\nsustainable compliance with\nthe OCC\u2019s 2020 Consent Order,\nincluding any requirements on\nwhich Citibank is not making\nsufficient and sustainable\nprogress (such process, the\nResource Review Plan). Copies\nof the 2024 Consent Orders and\nthe Amendment were included as\nexhibits to Citi\u2019s July 10,\n2024 Form 8-K. For additional\ninformation regarding the 2024\n\nConsent Orders and the\nAmendment, see the July 10,\n2024 Form 8-K.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\ntransformation efforts include\neffective implementation of\nthe October 7, 2020 FRB and\nOCC Consent Orders issued to\nCitigroup and Citibank,\nrespectively. The 2020 Consent\nOrders require Citigroup and\nCitibank to implement\nextensive targeted action\nplans and submit quarterly\nprogress reports on a timely\nand sufficient basis,\ndetailing the results and\nstatus of improvements\nrelating principally to\nvarious aspects of (i)\nenterprise-wide risk\nmanagement, (ii) compliance\nrisk management, (iii) data\nquality management related to\ngovernance, and (iv) internal\ncontrols. Citi continues to\nwork constructively with the\nFRB and OCC and provide\nadditional information\nregarding its plans and\nprogress to both regulators on\nan ongoing basis. Citi will\ncontinue to reflect their\nfeedback in its project plans\nand execution efforts.\nAlthough there are no\nrestrictions on Citi\u2019s ability\nto serve its clients, the 2020\nOCC Consent Order requires\nCitibank to obtain prior\napproval of any significant\nnew acquisition, including any\nportfolio or business\nacquisition, excluding\nordinary course transactions.\nFor additional information\nabout the requirements under\nthe 2020 Consent Orders, see\nCiti\u2019s Current Report on Form\n8-K filed with the SEC on\nOctober 9, 2020.\n                                                                \n  Governance                                                    \n                                                                \nCiti has built an organization\nand infrastructure to manage,\nguide and support its\ntransformation, which spans\nall businesses and functions\nto ensure consistency.\nAdditionally, the Citigroup\nand Citibank Boards of\nDirectors each formed a\nTransformation Oversight\nCommittee, an ad hoc committee\nof each Board, to provide\noversight of Citi\u2019s efforts to\nimprove its risk and control\nenvironment and management\u2019s\nremediation efforts under the\nconsent orders.\n\nWhile every member of Citi\u2019s\nexecutive management team, or\nEMT, is involved in the\ntransformation and plays a\nkey, direct role in its\nimplementation, Citi\u2019s CEO has\ntaken a leading role in\nmanaging the effort. As part\nof this effort, Citi\u2019s CEO has\nassembled a team consisting of\nlong-tenured employees and new\nhires from across various\ndisciplines and areas of\nexpertise and experience,\nalong with representatives\nfrom each of Citi\u2019s businesses\nand functions, to lead the\nvarious transformation\nprograms. Citi is focusing the\nCompany\u2019s most senior talent\non this effort and has a\ndetailed, integrated approach\nto execute on the\ntransformation. Citi\u2019s\nTransformation Steering\nCommittee, chaired by Citi\u2019s\nCEO, sets the overall\ndirection for the\ntransformation and\ncommunicates progress to the\nCitigroup Board of Directors,\nas well as seeks input and\nfeedback from the Board.\n\nIn 2023, Citi appointed a\nChief Operating Officer, who\nreports to the CEO and is\nresponsible for running Citi\u2019s\noverall transformation\nefforts, as well as leading\nCiti\u2019s efforts to improve\noperating efficiency and\nreturns along with Citi\u2019s\nenterprise-wide effort to\nstrengthen its risk and\ncontrols and data quality, and\nmodernize infrastructure,\nwhile simplifying the Company.\nIn 2024, Citi hired a new Head\nof Technology and Business\nEnablement, who reports to the\nCEO and works closely with\nCiti\u2019s transformation team to\ndrive improvements to data\nquality and modernize\ninfrastructure, while driving\nsimplification and automation\nacross Citi.\n                               12                               \n                                                                \n  Transformation Bonus Program                                  \n                                                                \nIn 2021, the Compensation,\nPerformance Management and\nCulture Committee (the\nCompensation Committee) of\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of Directors\napproved a long-term\nperformance-based bonus\nprogram to incentivize\neffective execution in\nconnection with the\ntransformation and remediation\nof the consent orders and to\ndrive change in Citi\u2019s risk\nand control environment and\nculture (the Transformation\nBonus Program, or the\nProgram). There are\napproximately 200 senior\nemployees who were deemed\ncritical to the execution of\nthe transformation and are\ntherefore eligible for the\nProgram.\n\nPerformance is measured, and\nthe bonus, if any, payable\npursuant to the Transformation\nBonus Program is paid in three\ntranches, each representing a\nseparate performance period.\n\nWell-defined goals and related\nmetrics are established for\neach of the three tranches,\nwhich may reflect qualitative\nconsiderations, including\nregulatory actions. At the end\nof each year, the Compensation\nCommittee determines the\nappropriate level of payout\ngiven the accomplishments for\nthe performance period\nrelative to the specific goals\nand related metrics. The\nmaximum portion of the bonus\npayable for each tranche was\n25% for the first tranche, 25%\nfor the second tranche and is\n50% for the third tranche.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe Transformation Bonus\nProgram, including the\nCompensation Committee\u2019s\ndetermination with respect to\nperformance metrics, targets\nand achievements for the first\nand second performance\nmeasurement periods under the\nProgram, see \u201cCiti\u2019s Multiyear\nTransformation\u201d in Citi\u2019s\nSecond Quarter of 2024 Form\n10-Q and Citi\u2019s 2024 Proxy\nStatement for Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Meeting of\nStockholders.

Excluding\nthe impact of the Argentina\ncurrency devaluation\n(approximately $(178) million,\ncompared to approximately\n$(1.2) billion in the prior\nyear), revenues increased 3%.\n\nNon-interest revenue increased\n28%, largely due to the\nsmaller impact from the\nArgentina currency\ndevaluation. Excluding the\nimpact of the Argentina\ncurrency devaluation, non-\ninterest revenue increased 5%,\ndriven by continued strength\nacross underlying fee drivers\nin TTS and Securities\nServices. Net interest income\nincreased 1%, as the benefit\nof higher deposit and loan\nvolumes was largely offset by\na decline in interest rates in\nArgentina. Average deposits\nincreased 1%, primarily driven\nby growth in Securities\nServices. Citi continued to\nincrease operating deposits in\nboth TTS and Securities\nServices.\n\nTTS revenues increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by a 37%\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue, partially offset by a\n1%\n\ndecrease in net interest\nincome. The increase in non-\ninterest revenue was largely\ndriven by the smaller impact\nfrom the Argentina currency\ndevaluation (approximately\n$(164) million, compared to\napproximately $(1.0) billion\nin the prior year). Excluding\nthe Argentina currency\ndevaluation, non-interest\nrevenue grew 3%, reflecting\ngrowth in underlying fee\ndrivers, including cross-\nborder transaction value (up\n6%), U.S. dollar clearing\nvolume (up 7%) and commercial\ncard spend volume (up 5%). The\ndecrease in net interest\nincome was primarily driven by\nthe decline in interest rates\nin Argentina. Average deposits\nwere largely unchanged, as\ngrowth in International was\noffset by a decrease in North\nAmerica.

The increase\nin spreads was driven by\nhigher interest rates and\ndeposit mix across currencies.\nAverage deposits increased 6%,\ndriven by growth in both North\nAmerica and International.

AUC/AUA balances\nincreased 8%, benefiting from\nhigher market valuations, new\nclient onboarding and\ndeepening share of existing\nclient wallet.\n\nExpenses increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in technology and\nplatform modernization, other\nrisk and controls and product\ninnovation, as well as an\nArgentina-related transaction\ntax expense and higher legal\nexpenses, partially offset by\nthe impact of productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions were $276 million,\ncompared to $950 million in\nthe prior year, primarily\ndriven by a lower ACL build on\nother assets.\n\nThe net ACL build was $228\nmillion, compared to $910\nmillion in the prior year. The\nlower net ACL build was\nprimarily due to a smaller\nbuild for transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S., driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nServices \u2019 corporate credit\nportfolio, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u2014Corporate Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\ntrends in Services \u2019 deposits\nand loans, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit Risk\u2014Loans\u201d\nand \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u2014Deposits\u201d\nbelow.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to Services\n\u2019 future results, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d above and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Russia\u201d below.\n                               20                               \n                                                                \n  MARKETS                                                       \n                                                                \nMarkets provides corporate, institutional and public sector\nclients around the world with a full range of sales and trading\nservices across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread\nproducts and commodities. The range of services includes market-\nmaking across asset classes, risk management solutions,\nfinancing and prime brokerage.\n\nAs a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including\nholding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the\ndifferential between the price at which it buys and sells the\nproducts.

Markets revenues\ninclude revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue\nsharing arrangement with Banking \u2014Corporate Lending for\nInvestment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to\nCorporate Lending clients.\n\nAssuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in\nclient activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in\nincreases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can\nsignificantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads\nand the fair value of product inventory. Management of the\nMarkets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of\nthe above factors.\n\nMarkets \u2019 international presence is supported by trading floors\nin approximately 80

for\nInvestment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to\nCorporate Lending clients.\n\n(3) Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total\nrevenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items.\nFor example, securities that generate Net interest income may be\nrisk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a\ndescription of the composition of these revenue line items, see\nNotes 4, 5 and 6.\n\n(4) Management uses this information in reviewing the segment\u2019s\nresults and believes it is useful to investors concerning\nunderlying segment performance and trends.\n\n(5) Excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all\nperiods.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n                                                                \n  2024 vs. 2023                                                 \n                                                                \nNet income of $4.9 billion\nincreased 27%, driven by\nhigher revenues, partially\noffset by higher cost of\ncredit.\n\nRevenues increased 6%, driven\nby higher Equity Markets and\nFixed Income Markets revenues.\nCiti expects that revenues in\nits Markets businesses will\nreflect the overall market\nenvironment during 2025.\n\nFixed Income Markets revenues\nincreased 1%, driven by spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome, partially offset by\nlower revenues in rates and\ncurrencies. Rates and\ncurrencies revenues decreased\n6%, largely reflecting lower\nvolatility and a strong prior-\nyear performance, partially\noffset by the smaller impact\nof the Argentina currency\ndevaluation . Spread products\nand other fixed income\nrevenues increased 20%,\nlargely driven by increased\nclient activity due to growth\nin asset-backed financing,\nsecuritization activity and\nunderwriting fees. These\nincreases were partially\noffset by a decline in\ncommodities revenues on lower\noverall volatility.\n\nEquity Markets revenues\nincreased 26%, driven by\ngrowth in cash equities due to\nhigher client activity and\nvolumes. The increase in\nrevenues was also due to\ngrowth in equity derivative\nrevenues on higher volatility,\nwhich also included the impact\nfrom an episodic gain related\nto the Visa B exchange. The\nincrease in revenues was also\ndriven by growth in prime\nservices, as Equity Markets\ncontinued to experience an\nincrease in prime balances .\n\nExpenses were largely\nunchanged, as higher legal\nexpenses and higher volume-\nrelated expenses were offset\nby productivity savings.\n\nProvisions were $463 million,\ncompared to $438 million in\nthe prior year, primarily\ndriven by higher net credit\nlosses, partially offset by a\nlower ACL build on other\nassets.\n\nNet credit losses were $168\nmillion, compared to $32\nmillion in the prior year,\nlargely driven by higher\nlosses on loans in spread\nproducts.\n\nThe net ACL build was $295\nmillion, compared to a net\nbuild of $406 million in the\nprior year . The lower net ACL\nbuild was primarily due to a\nsmaller build for transfer\nrisk associated with exposures\noutside the U.S., driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nMarkets \u2019 corporate

Excluding the impact\nof losses on loan hedges,\nCorporate Lending revenues\nincreased 9%, primarily driven\nby a smaller impact from the\ncurrency devaluation in\nArgentina.\n\nExpenses decreased 8%,\nprimarily driven by benefits\nof prior repositioning actions\nand other actions to lower the\n\nexpense base, partially offset\nby higher volume-related\nexpenses.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $224 million, compared to a\nbenefit of $143 million in the\nprior year, primarily driven\nby an ACL release on other\nassets.\n\nThe net ACL release was $373\nmillion, compared to a net\nrelease of $312 million in the\nprior year, primarily due to\nlower transfer risk associated\nwith exposures outside the\nU.S., driven by safety and\nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law. The net ACL\nreleases on loans and unfunded\nlending commitments in 2024\nwere primarily driven by\nimproved macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nBanking \u2019s corporate credit\nportfolio, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u2014Corporate Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\ntrends in Banking \u2019s deposits\nand loans, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit Risk\u2014Loans\u201d\nand \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u2014Deposits\u201d\nbelow.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to Banking\n\u2019s future results, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d above and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Russia\u201d below.\n                               24                               \n                                                                \n  WEALTH                                                        \n                                                                \nWealth includes the Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold\nbusinesses and provides financial services to a range of client\nsegments including affluent, high net worth and ultra-high net\nworth clients through banking, lending, mortgages, investment,\ncustody and trust product offerings in 20 countries, including\nthe U.S., Mexico and four wealth management centers: Singapore,\nHong Kong, the UAE and London.

largely\ndriven by an increase in non-\ninterest revenue (up 15%),\nreflecting higher investment\nfee revenues on growth in\nclient investment assets, as\nwell as an increase in net\ninterest income (up 2%). The\nincrease in net interest\nincome was mainly due to\nhigher average deposit spreads\nand volumes, partially offset\nby higher mortgage funding\ncosts.\n\nClient balances increased 8%,\nprimarily driven by higher\nclient investment assets (up\n18%), reflecting strong net\nnew investment assets\ngeneration and higher market\nvaluations.\n\nAverage deposits increased 2%,\nreflecting the transfers of\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits from USPB\n($17 billion at the time of\ntransfer over the last 12\nmonths), partially offset by a\nshift in deposits to higher-\nyielding investments on Citi\u2019s\nplatform. Average loans\ndecreased 1%, as Wealth\ncontinued to optimize capital\nusage.\n\nPrivate Bank and Wealth at\nWork revenues both increased\n2%, driven by the improved\ndeposit spreads and the higher\ninvestment fee revenues,\npartially offset by the higher\nmortgage funding costs.\n\nCitigold revenues increased\n11%, driven by the higher\ninvestment fee revenues, as\nwell as higher deposit spreads\nand volumes, reflecting the\ntransfer of relationships and\nthe associated deposits from\nUSPB .\n\nExpenses decreased 2%, mainly\ndriven by benefits from prior\nrepositioning and\nrestructuring actions,\npartially offset by higher\nvolume-related expenses and\ntechnology investments focused\non risk and controls and\nplatform enhancements.\n\nProvisions were a benefit of\n$126 million, compared to a\nbenefit of $3 million in the\nprior year, largely driven by\na higher net ACL release. The\nhigher net ACL release was\nprimarily due to a change in\nthe ACL associated with the\nmargin lending portfolio.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nWealth \u2019s loan portfolios, see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to Wealth \u2019s\nfuture results, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d below.\n                               26                               \n                                                                \n  U.S. PERSONAL BANKING                                         \n                                                                \nU.S. Personal Banking (USPB) includes Branded Cards and Retail\nServices, with proprietary credit card portfolios (Value,\nRewards and Cash) and co-branded card portfolios (including\nCostco and American Airlines) within Branded Cards, and co-brand\nand private label relationships within Retail Services\n(including, among others, The Home Depot, Best Buy, Macy\u2019s and\nSears).

reflecting\nhigher cost of credit,\npartially offset by higher\nrevenues and lower expenses.\n\nRevenues increased 6%, due to\nhigher net interest income (up\n5%), driven by strong loan\ngrowth, primarily in cards, as\nwell as higher non-interest\nrevenue (up 24%). The increase\nin non-interest revenue was\nlargely driven by lower\npartner payments in Retail\nServices, due to higher net\ncredit losses, and an increase\nin interchange fees (see Note\n5), driven by higher card\nspend volume in Branded Cards.\nThe increase in non-interest\nrevenue was partially offset\nby an increase in rewards\ncosts in Branded Cards, driven\nby the higher card spend\nvolume.\n\nCards revenues increased 7%.\nBranded Cards revenues\nincreased 7%, primarily driven\nby interest-earning balance\ngrowth (up 9%), as payment\nrates continued to moderate,\nand card spend volume growth.\nBranded Cards average loans\nincreased 9%, also reflecting\nthe lower card payment rates\nand higher card spend volume.\nBranded Cards spend volume\nincreased 4%, driven by higher\nFICO band customers.\n\nRetail Services revenues\nincreased 8%, primarily driven\nby higher non-interest revenue\ndue to the lower partner\npayments, driven by the higher\nnet credit losses (see\n\u201cProvisions\u201d below and Note\n5), as well as higher net\ninterest income on growth in\ninterest-earning balances.\nRetail Services average loans\nincreased 3%, largely\nreflecting lower card payment\nrates, partially offset by\nlower card spend volume.\nRetail Services card spend\nvolume decreased 5%, primarily\ndue to lower in-store foot\ntraffic.\n\nRetail Banking revenues\ndecreased 1%, driven by the\nimpact of the transfers of\ncertain relationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nWealth , partially offset by\nhigher deposit spreads, as\nwell as mortgage and\ninstallment loan growth.\nAverage mortgage loans\nincreased 15%, primarily\ndriven by lower refinancings\ndue to higher interest rates\nand higher mortgage\noriginations. Average deposits\ndecreased 17%, largely\nreflecting the transfer of\ncertain relationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nWealth ($17 billion at the\ntime of transfer over the last\n12 months).\n\nExpenses decreased 1%, driven\nby continued productivity\nsavings and lower technology\ncosts, partially offset by\nhigher volume-related\nexpenses.\n\nProvisions were $8.6 billion,\ncompared to $6.7 billion in\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby higher net credit losses,\npartially offset by a lower\nACL build for loans.\n\nNet credit losses of $7.6\nbillion increased 45%,\nprimarily reflecting the\ncontinued maturation of\nmultiple cards loan vintages\noriginated in recent years.\nThe maturation was delayed by\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus during the\npandemic. In addition, the\nincrease was driven by\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncards portfolios, with lower\nFICO band customers primarily\ndriving the increase. Branded\nCards net credit losses of\n$4.0 billion and Retail\nServices net credit losses of\n$3.2 billion increased 51% and\n39%, respectively.\n\nThe net ACL build was $1.0\nbillion, compared to $1.5\nbillion in the prior year. The\nnet ACL build on loans was\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof macroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment, as well as growth\nin cards balances.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nUSPB \u2019s Branded Cards, Retail\nServices and Retail Banking\nloan portfolios, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to USPB \u2019s\nfuture results, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d below.\n                               28                               \nALL OTHER\u2014Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)\n\nAll Other includes activities not assigned to the reportable\noperating segments ( Services , Markets , Banking , Wealth and\nUSPB ), which are reported within Legacy Franchises and\nCorporate/Other.

The Citigroup\nCapital Committee, with\noversight from the Risk\nManagement Committee of\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors, has responsibility\nfor Citi\u2019s aggregate capital\nstructure, including the\ncapital assessment and\nplanning process, which is\nintegrated into Citi\u2019s capital\nplan. Balance sheet\nmanagement, including\noversight of capital adequacy\nfor Citigroup\u2019s subsidiaries,\nis governed by each entity\u2019s\nAsset and Liability Committee,\nwhere applicable.\n\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s capital\nplanning and stress testing\nexercises, see \u201cStress Testing\nComponent of Capital Planning\u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  Current Regulatory Capital Standards                          \n                                                                \nCiti is subject to regulatory\ncapital rules issued by the\nFRB, in coordination with the\nOCC and FDIC, including the\nU.S. implementation of the\nBasel III rules (for\ninformation on potential\nchanges to the Basel III\nrules, see \u201cRegulatory Capital\nStandards and Developments\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisks\u201d below). These rules\nestablish an integrated\ncapital adequacy framework,\nencompassing both risk-based\ncapital ratios and leverage\nratios. Banking and broker-\ndealer subsidiaries of\nCitigroup are also subject to\nlocal capital requirements in\nthe jurisdictions in which\nthey operate, which impact\nallocations of capital within\nCitigroup, and may restrict\nthe ability to remit earnings\nto Citigroup. The availability\nof such earnings may impact\nthe ability of Citigroup to\nengage in return of capital to\ncommon shareholders in the\nform of dividends and share\nrepurchases, absorb potential\nlosses and support business\ngrowth.\n                                                                \n  Risk-Based Capital Ratios                                     \n                                                                \nThe U.S. Basel III rules set\nforth the composition of\nregulatory capital (including\nthe application of regulatory\ncapital adjustments and\ndeductions), as well as two\ncomprehensive methodologies (a\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches) for\nmeasuring total risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nTotal risk-weighted assets\nunder the Standardized\nApproach include credit and\nmarket risk-weighted assets,\nwhich are generally prescribed\nsupervisory risk weights.\nTotal risk-weighted assets\nunder the Advanced Approaches,\nwhich are primarily model\nbased, include credit, market\nand operational risk-weighted\nassets. As a result, credit\nrisk-weighted assets\ncalculated under the Advanced\nApproaches are more risk\nsensitive than those\ncalculated under the\nStandardized Approach. Market\nrisk-weighted assets are\ncurrently calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis\nunder both the Standardized\nand Advanced Approaches. The\nStandardized Approach does not\ninclude operational risk-\nweighted assets.\n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, Citigroup is required\nto maintain several regulatory\ncapital buffers above the\nstated minimum capital\nrequirements to avoid certain\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments\nto executive officers.\nAccordingly, for the fourth\nquarter of 2024, Citigroup\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio was 12.1% under\nthe Standardized Approach\n(incorporating its Stress\nCapital Buffer of 4.1% and\nGSIB (Global Systemically\n                               33                               \nImportant Bank) surcharge of\n3.5%) and 10.5% under the\nAdvanced Approaches (inclusive\nof the fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer and GSIB\nsurcharge of 3.5%).\n\nSimilarly, Citigroup\u2019s primary\nsubsidiary, Citibank, N.A.\n(Citibank), is required to\nmaintain minimum regulatory\ncapital ratios plus applicable\nregulatory buffers, as well as\nhold sufficient capital to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nunder the Prompt Corrective\nAction framework. In effect,\nCitibank\u2019s required CET1\nCapital ratio was 7.0% under\nboth the Standardized and\nAdvanced Approaches, which is\nthe sum of the minimum 4.5%\nCET1 requirement and a fixed\n2.5% Capital Conservation\nBuffer. For additional\ninformation, see \u201cRegulatory\nCapital Buffers\u201d and \u201cPrompt\nCorrective Action Framework\u201d\nbelow.\n\nFurther, the U.S. Basel III\nrules implement the \u201ccapital\nfloor provision\u201d of the Dodd-\nFrank Act (the so-called\n\u201cCollins Amendment\u201d), which\nrequires banking organizations\nto calculate \u201cgenerally\napplicable\u201d capital\nrequirements. As a result,\nCiti must calculate each of\nthe three risk-based capital\nratios (CET1 Capital, Tier 1\nCapital and Total Capital)\nunder both the Standardized\nApproach and the Advanced\nApproaches and comply with the\nmore binding of each of the\nresulting risk-based capital\nratios.\n                                                                \n  Leverage Ratio                                                \n                                                                \nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, Citigroup is also\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nLeverage ratio of 4.0%.\nSimilarly, Citibank is\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nLeverage ratio of 5.0% to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nunder the Prompt Corrective\nAction framework. The Leverage\nratio, a non-risk-based\nmeasure of capital adequacy,\nis defined as Tier 1 Capital\nas a percentage of quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nless amounts deducted from\nTier 1 Capital.\n                                                                \n  Supplementary Leverage Ratio                                  \n                                                                \nCiti is also required to\ncalculate a Supplementary\nLeverage ratio (SLR), which\ndiffers from the Leverage\nratio by including certain\noff-balance sheet exposures\nwithin the denominator of the\nratio (Total Leverage\nExposure). The SLR represents\nend-of-period Tier 1 Capital\nto Total Leverage Exposure.\nTotal Leverage Exposure is\ndefined as the sum of (i) the\ndaily average of on-balance\nsheet assets for the quarter\nand (ii) the average of\ncertain off-balance sheet\nexposures calculated as of the\nlast day of each month in the\nquarter, less applicable Tier\n1 Capital deductions. Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations are required to\nmaintain a stated minimum SLR\nof 3.0%.\n\nFurther, U.S. GSIBs, including\nCitigroup, are subject to a\n2.0% leverage buffer in\naddition to the 3.0% stated\nminimum SLR requirement,\nresulting in a 5.0% SLR. If a\nU.S. GSIB fails to exceed this\nrequirement, it will be\nsubject to increasingly\nstringent restrictions\n(depending upon the extent of\nthe shortfall) on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary executive bonus\npayments.\n\nSimilarly, Citibank is\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nSLR of 6.0% to be considered\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the\nPrompt Corrective Action\nframework.\n\nRegulatory Capital\nTreatment\u2014Modified Transition\nof the Current Expected Credit\nLosses Methodology\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking\nagencies issued a final rule\nthat modified the regulatory\ncapital transition provision\nrelated to the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology. The rule does not\nhave any impact on U.S. GAAP\naccounting.\n\nThe rule permitted banks to\ndelay for two years the \u201cDay\nOne\u201d adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology on January 1, 2020\nuntil January 1, 2022,\nfollowed by a three-year\ntransition to phase out the\nregulatory capital benefit\nprovided by the delay.\n\nIn addition, for the ongoing\nimpact of CECL, the agencies\nutilized a 25% scaling factor\nas an approximation of the\nincreased reserve build under\nCECL compared to the previous\nincurred loss model and,\ntherefore, allowed banks to\nadd back to CET1 Capital an\namount equal to 25% of the\nchange in CECL-based\nallowances in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022, the\ncumulative 25% change in CECL-\nbased allowances between\nJanuary 1, 2020 and December\n31, 2021 started to be phased\nin to regulatory capital (i)\nat 25% per year on January 1\nof each year over the three-\nyear transition period and\n(ii) along with the delayed\nDay One impact.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank elected\nthe modified CECL transition\nprovision provided by the\nrule. Accordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from adoption of the\nCECL methodology, as well as\nthe ongoing adjustments for\n25% of the change in CECL-\nbased allowances in each\nquarter between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021,\nstarted to be phased in on\nJanuary 1, 2022 and were fully\nreflected in Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital as of January 1, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024,\nCitigroup\u2019s reported\nStandardized Approach CET1\nCapital ratio of 13.6%\nbenefited from the deferrals\nof the CECL transition\nprovision by 8 basis points.\nFor additional information on\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital ratios\nexcluding the impact of the\nCECL transition provision, see\n\u201cCapital Resources (Full\nAdoption of CECL)\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Buffers                                    \n                                                                \nCitigroup and Citibank are\nrequired to maintain several\nregulatory capital buffers\nabove the stated minimum\ncapital requirements. These\ncapital buffers would be\navailable to absorb losses in\nadvance of any potential\nimpairment of regulatory\ncapital below the stated\nminimum regulatory capital\nratio requirements.\n\nBanking organizations that\nfall below their regulatory\ncapital buffers are subject to\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments\nto executive officers based on\na percentage of \u201cEligible\nRetained Income\u201d (ERI), with\nincreasing restrictions based\non the severity of the breach.\nERI is equal to the greater of\n(i) the bank\u2019s net income for\nthe four calendar quarters\npreceding the current calendar\nquarter, net of any\ndistributions and tax effects\nnot already reflected in net\nincome, and (ii) the average\nof the bank\u2019s net income for\nthe four calendar quarters\npreceding the current calendar\nquarter.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024,\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios exceeded the regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nAccordingly,\n                               34                               \nCiti is not subject to payout\nlimitations as a result of the\nU.S. Basel III requirements.\nStress Capital Buffer\nCitigroup is subject to the\nFRB\u2019s Stress Capital Buffer\n(SCB) rule, which integrates\nthe annual stress testing\nrequirements with ongoing\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. The SCB equals\nthe peak-to-trough CET1\nCapital ratio decline under\nthe Supervisory Severely\nAdverse scenario over a nine-\nquarter period used in the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST), plus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, subject to a floor\nof 2.5%. SCB-based capital\nrequirements are reviewed and\nupdated annually by the FRB as\npart of the CCAR process. For\nadditional information\nregarding CCAR and DFAST, see\n\u201cStress Testing Component of\nCapital Planning\u201d below. The\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer will\ncontinue to apply under the\nAdvanced Approaches (see\nbelow). As of October 1, 2024,\nCiti\u2019s required regulatory\nCET1 Capital ratio decreased\nto 12.1% from 12.3% under the\nStandardized Approach,\nincorporating the 4.1% SCB\nthrough September 30, 2025 and\nCiti\u2019s current GSIB surcharge\nof 3.5%. Citi\u2019s required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nunder the Advanced Approaches\n(using the fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer) remains\nunchanged at 10.5%. The SCB\napplies to Citigroup only; the\nregulatory capital framework\napplicable to Citibank,\nincluding the Capital\nConservation Buffer, is\nunaffected by Citigroup\u2019s SCB.\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer Citigroup is subject to\na fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer under the\nAdvanced Approaches. Citibank\nis subject to the fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nunder both the Advanced\nApproaches and the\nStandardized Approach. In\naddition, Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations, such as\nCitigroup and Citibank, are\nsubject to a discretionary\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer. The Countercyclical\nCapital Buffer is currently\nset at 0% by the U.S. banking\nagencies. GSIB Surcharge The\nFRB imposes a risk-based\ncapital surcharge upon U.S.\nbank holding companies that\nare identified as GSIBs,\nincluding Citi (for\ninformation on potential\nchanges to the GSIB surcharge,\nsee \u201cRegulatory Capital\nStandards and Developments\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisks\u201d below). The GSIB\nsurcharge augments the SCB,\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand, if invoked, any\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer. Citi, as a GSIB, is\nannually required to calculate\na surcharge using two methods\nand is subject to the higher\nof the resulting two\nsurcharges. The first method\n(method 1) is based on the\nBasel Committee\u2019s GSIB\nmethodology. Under the second\nmethod (method 2), the\nsubstitutability category\nunder the Basel Committee\u2019s\nGSIB methodology is replaced\nwith a quantitative measure\nintended to assess a GSIB\u2019s\nreliance on short-term\nwholesale funding. In\naddition, method 1\nincorporates relative measures\nof systemic importance across\ncertain global banking\norganizations and a year-end\nspot foreign exchange rate,\nwhereas method 2 uses fixed\n\nmeasures of systemic\nimportance and application of\nan average foreign exchange\nrate over a three-year period.\nThe GSIB surcharges calculated\nunder both method 1 and method\n2 are based on measures of\nsystemic importance from the\nyear immediately preceding\nthat in which the GSIB\nsurcharge calculations are\nbeing performed (e.g., the\nmethod 1 and method 2 GSIB\nsurcharges calculated during\n2025 will be based on 2024\nsystemic indicator data).\nGenerally, Citi\u2019s surcharge\ndetermined under method 2 will\nbe higher than its surcharge\ndetermined under method 1.\nShould a GSIB\u2019s systemic\nimportance change year-over-\nyear, such that it becomes\nsubject to a higher GSIB\nsurcharge, the higher\nsurcharge would become\neffective on January 1 of the\nyear that is one full calendar\nyear after the increased GSIB\nsurcharge was calculated\n(e.g., a higher surcharge\ncalculated in 2025 using data\nas of December 31, 2024 would\nnot become effective until\nJanuary 1, 2027). However, if\na GSIB\u2019s systemic importance\nchanges such that the GSIB\nwould be subject to a lower\nsurcharge, the GSIB would be\nsubject to the lower surcharge\non January 1 of the year\nimmediately following the\ncalendar year in which the\ndecreased GSIB surcharge was\ncalculated (e.g., a lower\nsurcharge calculated in 2025\nusing data as of December 31,\n2024 would become effective\nJanuary 1, 2026). The\nfollowing table presents\nCiti\u2019s effective GSIB\nsurcharge as determined under\nmethod 1 and method 2 during\n2024 and 2023:\n                                  \n              2024       2023     \n  Method 1     2.0  %     2.0  %  \n  Method 2     3.5        3.5     \n                                  \nCiti\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective during 2024 and 2023\nwas 3.5%, as derived under the\nhigher method 2 result. For\n2025, Citi\u2019s GSIB surcharge\nremains unchanged at 3.5%, as\nderived under the higher\nmethod 2 result. Citi expects\nthat its method 2 GSIB\nsurcharge will continue to\nremain higher than its method\n1 GSIB surcharge. Based on\nCiti\u2019s method 2 result as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and as of\nDecember 31, 2024, Citi\u2019s GSIB\nsurcharge is expected to\nremain at 3.5% for 2026.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nFramework In general, the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nregulations direct the U.S.\nbanking agencies to enforce\nincreasingly strict\nlimitations on the activities\nof insured depository\ninstitutions that fail to meet\ncertain regulatory capital\nthresholds. The PCA framework\ncontains five categories of\ncapital adequacy as measured\nby risk-based capital and\nleverage ratios: (i) \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d (ii) \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d (iii)\n\u201cundercapitalized,\u201d (iv)\n\u201csignificantly\nundercapitalized\u201d and (v)\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d\nAccordingly, an insured\ndepository institution, such\nas Citibank, must maintain\nminimum CET1 Capital, Tier 1\nCapital, Total Capital and\nLeverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%,\n10.0% and 5.0%, respectively,\nto be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized.\u201d In addition,\ninsured depository institution\nsubsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs,\nincluding Citibank, must\nmaintain a minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nof 6.0% to be\n                               35                               \nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\nCitibank was \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d as of December\n31, 2024.\n\nFurthermore, to be \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under current\nfederal bank regulatory agency\ndefinitions, a bank holding\ncompany must have a Tier 1\nCapital ratio of at least\n6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of\nat least 10.0% and not be\nsubject to a FRB directive to\nmaintain higher capital\nlevels.\n                                                                \n  Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning                  \n                                                                \nCiti is subject to an annual\nassessment by the FRB as to\nwhether Citigroup has\neffective capital planning\nprocesses as well as\nsufficient regulatory capital\nto absorb losses during\nstressful economic and\nfinancial conditions, while\nalso meeting obligations to\ncreditors and counterparties\nand continuing to serve as a\ncredit intermediary. This\nannual assessment includes two\nrelated programs: the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST).\n\nFor the largest and most\ncomplex firms, such as Citi,\nCCAR includes a qualitative\nevaluation of a firm\u2019s\nabilities to determine its\ncapital needs on a forward-\nlooking basis. In conducting\nthe qualitative assessment,\nthe FRB evaluates firms\u2019\ncapital planning practices,\nfocusing on six areas of\ncapital planning: governance,\nrisk management, internal\ncontrols, capital policies,\nincorporating stressful\nconditions and events, and\nestimating impact on capital\npositions. As part of the CCAR\nprocess, the FRB evaluates\nCiti\u2019s capital adequacy,\ncapital adequacy process and\nits planned capital\ndistributions, such as\ndividend payments and common\nshare repurchases. The FRB\nassesses whether Citi has\nsufficient capital to continue\noperations throughout times of\neconomic and financial market\nstress and whether Citi has\nrobust, forward-looking\ncapital planning processes\nthat account for its unique\nrisks.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including\nCiti, are subject to a\nrigorous evaluation of their\ncapital planning process.\nFirms with weak practices may\nbe subject to a deficient\nsupervisory rating, and\npotentially an enforcement\naction, for failing to meet\nsupervisory expectations. For\nadditional information\nregarding CCAR, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nbelow.\n\nDFAST is a forward-looking\nquantitative evaluation of the\nimpact of stressful economic\nand financial market\nconditions on Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. This\nprogram serves to inform the\nFRB and the general public as\nto how Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital ratios might change\nusing a hypothetical set of\nadverse economic conditions as\ndesigned by the FRB. In\naddition to the annual\nsupervisory stress test\nconducted by the FRB, Citi is\nrequired to conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests under\nthe same adverse economic\nconditions designed by the\nFRB.\n\nBoth CCAR and DFAST include an\nestimate of projected\nrevenues, losses, reserves,\npro forma regulatory capital\nratios and any other\nadditional capital measures\ndeemed relevant by Citi.\nProjections are required over\na nine-quarter planning\nhorizon under two supervisory\nscenarios (baseline and\nseverely adverse conditions).\nAll risk-based capital ratios\nreflect application of the\nStandardized Approach\nframework under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules.\n\nIn addition, Citibank is\nrequired to conduct the annual\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Test.\nThe annual stress test\nconsists of a forward-looking\nquantitative evaluation of the\nimpact of stressful economic\nand financial market\nconditions under several\nscenarios on Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital.

Citi continues\nto monitor developments\nrelated to this rulemaking,\nincluding as a result of new\nleadership at the U.S. banking\nagencies.\n\nThe capital proposal would\nmaintain the current capital\nrule\u2019s dual-requirement\nstructure for RWA, but would\neliminate the use of internal\nmodels to calculate credit\nrisk and operational risk\ncomponents of RWA. The capital\nproposal would also replace\nthe current market risk\nframework with a new\nstandardized methodology and a\nnew models-based methodology\nfor calculating RWA for market\nrisk. Large banking\norganizations, such as Citi,\nwould be required to calculate\ntheir risk-based capital\nratios under both the new\nexpanded risk-based approach\nand the Standardized Approach\nand use the lower of the two\nfor each risk-based capital\nratio for determining the\nbinding constraints.\n\nThe expanded risk-based\napproach is designed to align\nwith the international capital\nstandards adopted by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee).\nThe Basel Committee finalized\nthe Basel III reforms in\nDecember 2017, which included\nrevisions to the methodologies\nto determine credit, market\nand operational RWA amounts.\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the\ncapital proposal\u2019s impact on\nRWA amounts would also affect\nseveral other requirements\nincluding TLAC, external long-\nterm debt and the short-term\nwholesale funding score\nincluded in the GSIB surcharge\nunder method 2 (see \u201cGSIB\nSurcharge\u201d below). The\nproposal has a three-year\ntransition period that would\nbegin July 1, 2025. If\nfinalized as proposed, the\ncapital proposal would\nmaterially increase Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory capital.\n\nFor information about risks\nrelated to changes in\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks,\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Operational Risks\u201d and\n\u201c\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  GSIB Surcharge                                                \n                                                                \nSeparately on July 27, 2023,\nthe FRB proposed changes to\nthe GSIB surcharge rule that\naim to make it more risk\nsensitive. Proposed changes\ninclude measuring certain\nsystemic indicators on a daily\nversus quarterly average\nbasis, changing certain of the\nrisk indicators and shortening\nthe time to come into\ncompliance with each year\u2019s\nsurcharge. In addition, the\nproposal would narrow\nsurcharge bands under method 2\nfrom 50 bps to 10 bps to\nreduce cliff effects when\nmoving between bands.\n                                                                \n  Long-Term Debt Requirements                                   \n                                                                \nOn August 29, 2023, the FRB\nissued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking to amend the TLAC\nrule to change the haircuts\n(i.e., the percentage\nreductions) that are applied\nto eligible long-term debt.\nUnder the proposed rule, only\n50% of eligible long-term debt\nwith a maturity of one year or\nmore but less than two years\nwould count toward the TLAC\nrequirement, instead of the\ncurrent 100%. These proposed\nrevisions are estimated to\ndecrease the TLAC percentage\nof Advanced Approaches RWA as\nwell as the TLAC percentage of\nTotal Leverage Exposure. The\nproposed rule in its current\nform has no proposed\ntransition period for its\nimplementation and is not\nexpected to be material to\nCiti.\n                               48                               \nTa ngible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Return on\nEquity As defined by Citi,\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nrepresents common\nstockholders\u2019 equity less\ngoodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nmortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs)). Return on tangible\ncommon equity (RoTCE)\nrepresents annualized net\nincome available to common\nshareholders as a percentage\nof average TCE. Tangible book\nvalue per share (TBVPS)\nrepresents average TCE divided\nby average common shares\noutstanding.

discussion\npresents what management\ncurrently believes could be\nthe material risks and\nuncertainties that could\nimpact Citi\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition. Other\nrisks and uncertainties,\nincluding those not currently\nknown to Citi or its\nmanagement, could also\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. Thus, the following\nshould not be considered a\ncomplete discussion of all of\nthe risks and uncertainties\nthat Citi may face. For\nadditional information about\nrisks and uncertainties that\ncould impact Citi, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary,\u201d \u201cCiti\u2019s\nMultiyear Transformation\u201d and\neach respective business\u2019s\nresults of operations above\nand \u201cManaging Global Risk\u201d\nbelow. The following risk\nfactors are categorized to\nimprove the readability and\nusefulness of the risk factor\ndisclosure, and, while the\nheadings and risk factors\ngenerally align with Citi\u2019s\nrisk categorization, in\ncertain instances the risk\nfactors may not directly\ncorrespond with how Citi\ncategorizes or manages its\nrisks.\n                                                                \n  MARKET-RELATED RISKS                                          \n                                                                \nMacroeconomic, Geopolitical\nand Other Challenges and\nUncertainties Could Continue\nto Have a Negative Impact on\nCiti.\n\nCiti has experienced, and\ncould experience in the\nfuture, negative impacts to\nits businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition as a result of\nvarious macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nchallenges, uncertainties and\nvolatility. These include,\namong other things, any\nresurgence in inflation;\ngovernment fiscal and monetary\nactions or expected actions,\nincluding changes in interest\nrate policy, reductions in\ncentral bank balance sheets or\nother monetary policies; and\nincreases in unemployment\nrates, recessions or weak or\nslowing economic growth in the\nU.S., Europe and other regions\nor countries. These impacts\ncould adversely affect Citi\u2019s\nconsumer and institutional\nclients, businesses, cost of\ncredit and overall results of\noperations.\n\nFor example, inflation could\nresurge if the FRB were to\nreduce interest rates\nprematurely and/or at too\naccelerated a pace, or if\ncertain policies were further\npursued in the U.S., including\nthose related to trade,\ntariffs and immigration.\n\nInterest rates on loans Citi\nmakes are typically based off\nor set at a spread over a\nbenchmark interest rate and\nwould likely decline or rise\nas benchmark rates decline or\nrise, respectively. A decline\nin interest rates would\ngenerally be expected to\nresult in lower overall net\ninterest income for Citi,\nalthough Corporate Treasury\nhas various tools to manage\nCiti\u2019s total interest rate\nrisk position (see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014 Market\nRisk\u2014Market Risk of Non-\nTrading Portfolios\u201d below). In\naddition, Citi\u2019s net interest\nincome could be adversely\naffected due to a flattening\n(a lower spread between\nshorter-term versus longer-\nterm interest rates) or\ninversion (shorter-term\ninterest rates exceeding\nlonger-term interest rates) of\nthe interest rate yield curve,\nas Citi typically pays\ninterest on deposits based on\nshorter-term interest rates\nand earns money on loans based\non longer-term interest rates.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s interest rate risk, see\n\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Market\nRisk\u2014Banking Book Interest\nRate Risk\u201d below.\n\nAdditional areas of\nuncertainty include, among\nothers, geopolitical\nchallenges, tensions and\nconflicts, including those\nrelated to the Russia\u2013Ukraine\nwar (see below) and conflicts\nin the Middle East; potential\npolicies and priorities\nresulting from the new U.S.\nadministration; economic and\ngeopolitical challenges\nrelated to China, including\nweak economic growth, related\npolicy actions, challenges in\nthe Chinese real estate\nsector, banking and credit\nmarkets, trade restrictions,\nand tensions or conflicts\nbetween China and Taiwan\nand/or China and the U.S.;\nhigh and rising government\ndebt levels in the U.S. and\nother countries; significant\nvolatility and disruptions in\nfinancial markets, including\nforeign currency volatility\nand devaluations; natural\ndisasters; and pandemics.\n\nFor example, the\nRussia\u2013Ukraine war could have\nfurther negative impacts on\nregional and global energy and\nother commodities and\nfinancial markets and\nmacroeconomic conditions,\nadversely impacting\njurisdictions where Citi\noperates and its customers,\nclients or employees. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s remaining\noperations in Russia subject\nCiti to various other risks,\nincluding foreign currency\nvolatility, such as\nappreciations or devaluations;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory Russian laws and\nregulations on the conduct of\nCiti\u2019s remaining businesses,\nincluding, without limitation,\nits provision of certain\nsecurities services to\ncustomers; sanctions or asset\nfreezes; and other\ndeconsolidation events. For\nadditional information about\nthese Russia-related risks,\nsee the operational processes\nand systems, cybersecurity and\nemerging markets risk factors\nand \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Ability to Return\nCapital to Common Shareholders\nSubstantially Depends on\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements, Including the\nResults of the CCAR Process\nand Dodd-Frank Act Regulatory\nStress Tests, and Other\nFactors.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to return\ncapital to its common\nshareholders consistent with\nits capital planning efforts\nand targets, whether through\nits common stock dividend or\nthrough share repurchases,\nsubstantially depends, among\nother things, on its\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, including the\nannual recalibration of the\nStress Capital Buffer (SCB),\nwhich is based upon the\nresults of the CCAR process\nrequired by the FRB, and\nrecalibration of the GSIB\nsurcharge, as well as the\nsupervisory expectations and\nassessments regarding\nindividual institutions.\n\nThe FRB\u2019s annual stress\ntesting requirements are\nintegrated into ongoing\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. Citi\u2019s SCB\nequals the maximum projected\ndecline in its CET1 Capital\nratio under the supervisory\nseverely adverse scenario over\na nine-quarter CCAR\nmeasurement period, plus four\nquarters of planned common\nstock dividends as a\npercentage of Citi\u2019s risk-\nweighted assets, subject to a\nminimum requirement of 2.5%.\nThe SCB is calculated by the\nFRB using its proprietary data\nand modeling of each firm\u2019s\nresults. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nSCB may go up, based on the\nsupervisory stress test\nresults, thus potentially\nresulting in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s required regulatory\nCET1 Capital ratio under the\n                               50                               \nStandardized Approach. In\naddition, a breach of the SCB\nand other regulatory capital\nbuffers may result in gradual\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments\nto executive officers. For\nadditional information on the\nSCB, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nBuffers\u201d above.\n\nMoreover, changes in\nregulatory capital rules,\nrequirements or\ninterpretations could\nmaterially increase Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory capital.\nFor example, the U.S. banking\nregulators proposed a number\nof changes to the U.S.\nregulatory capital framework,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nsignificant revisions to the\nU.S. Basel III rules. These\npotential changes, if adopted\nas originally proposed, would\nlikely impact Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital position\nand materially increase Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, and thus\nadversely impact the extent to\nwhich Citi is able to return\ncapital to shareholders (see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards and\nDevelopments\u201d above).\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to return\ncapital also depends on its\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition, including\nthe capital impact related to\nits remaining divestitures,\nsuch as, among other things,\nany temporary capital impact\nfrom CTA losses, net of hedges\n(see the incorrect assumptions\nor estimates and the emerging\nmarkets risk factors below);\nCiti\u2019s effectiveness in\nplanning, managing and\ncalculating its level of\nregulatory capital and risk-\nweighted assets under both the\nAdvanced Approaches and the\nStandardized Approach, as well\nas the Supplementary Leverage\nratio (SLR); its\nimplementation and maintenance\nof an effective capital\nplanning process and\nmanagement framework;\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions; and deferred tax\nasset (DTA) utilization (see\nthe ability to utilize DTA\nrisk factor below).\n\nAll firms subject to CCAR\nrequirements, including Citi,\nwill continue to be subject to\na rigorous regulatory\nevaluation of capital planning\npractices and other reviews\nand examinations, including,\nbut not limited to data\nquality, which is a key\nregulatory focus, governance,\nrisk management and internal\ncontrols. For example, the FRB\nhas stated that it expects\ncapital adequacy practices to\ncontinue to evolve and to\nlikely be determined by its\nyearly cross-firm review of\ncapital plan submissions.\nSimilarly, the FRB has\nindicated that, as part of its\nstated goal to continually\nevolve its annual stress\ntesting requirements, several\nparameters of the annual\nstress testing process may\ncontinue to be altered,\nincluding the number and\nseverity of the stress test\nscenarios, the FRB modeling of\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet, pre-\nprovision net revenue and\nstress losses, and the\naddition of components deemed\nimportant by the FRB.\nAdditionally, Citi\u2019s ability\nto return capital may be\nadversely impacted if a\nregulatory evaluation or\nexamination were to result in\nnegative findings regarding\nabsolute capital levels or\nother aspects of Citi\u2019s or any\nof its subsidiaries\u2019\noperations, including as a\nresult of the imposition of\nadditional capital buffers,\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions or otherwise.\nFor information on limitations\non Citi\u2019s ability to return\ncapital to common\nshareholders, as well as the\nCCAR process, supervisory\nstress test requirements and\nGSIB surcharge, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Overview\u201d and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Stress\nTesting Component of Capital\nPlanning\u201d above and the risk\nmanagement and legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactors below.\n\nIn October 2024, the FRB\nannounced that it will\nmaintain its current framework\nfor calculating allowances on\nloans in the supervisory\nstress test through the 2025\nstress test cycle, while\ncontinuing to evaluate\nappropriate future\nenhancements to this\nframework. The impacts on\nCiti\u2019s capital adequacy of any\npotential incorporation by the\nFRB of CECL into its\nsupervisory stress tests in\nfuture stress test cycles, and\nof other potential regulatory\nchanges in the FRB\u2019s stress\ntesting methodologies, remain\nunclear. For additional\ninformation regarding the CECL\nmethodology, including the\ntransition provisions related\nto the adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Current Regulatory\nCapital Standards\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Treatment\u2014Modified\nTransition of the Current\nExpected Credit Losses\nMethodology\u201d above and Note 1.\n\nAlthough various uncertainties\nexist regarding the extent of,\nand the ultimate impact to\nCiti from, changes to\nregulatory capital, results\nfrom the FRB\u2019s stress testing\nand CCAR regimes, and\nregulatory evaluation or\nexamination findings, these\nchanges could increase the\nlevel of capital Citi is\nrequired or elects to hold,\nincluding as part of Citi\u2019s\nmanagement buffer, thus\npotentially adversely\nimpacting the extent to which\nCiti is able to return capital\nto shareholders.\n\nCiti Must Continually Review,\nAnalyze and Successfully Adapt\nto Ongoing Regulatory and\nLegislative Uncertainties and\nChanges in the U.S. and\nGlobally.\n\nCiti, its management and its\nbusinesses continue to face\nregulatory and legislative\nuncertainties and changes,\nboth in the U.S. and globally.\nWhile the ongoing regulatory\nand legislative uncertainties\nand changes facing Citi are\ntoo numerous to list\ncompletely, examples include,\nbut are not limited to (i)\npotential changes to various\naspects of the U.S. regulatory\ncapital framework and\nrequirements applicable to\nCiti, including, among others,\nsignificant revisions to the\nU.S. Basel III rules (see the\ncapital return risk factor and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards and\nDevelopments\u201d above) and (ii)\npotential fiscal, monetary,\ntax, sanctions, human capital\nand other changes promulgated\nby the U.S. federal government\nand other governments (see the\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical\nrisk factor above and the\nability to utilize DTAs risk\nfactor below). References to\n\u201cregulatory\u201d refer to both\nformal regulation and the\nviews and expectations of\nCiti\u2019s regulators in their\nsupervisory and enforcement\nroles, which, as they change\nover time, can have a major\nimpact. In particular, U.S.\nregulators have indicated that\nthe level of their\nexpectations is increasing and\nprompt negative examination\nfindings/ratings and\nenforcements actions are more\nlikely.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. and\ninternational regulatory and\nlegislative initiatives have\nnot always been undertaken or\nimplemented on a coordinated\nbasis, and areas of divergence\nhave developed and continue to\ndevelop with respect to their\nscope, interpretation, timing,\nstructure or approach, leading\nto inconsistent or even\nconflicting requirements,\nincluding within a single\njurisdiction.\n\nFurther, ongoing regulatory\nand legislative uncertainties\nand changes make Citi\u2019s long-\nterm business, balance sheet\nand strategic budget planning\ndifficult, subject to change\nand\n                               51                               \npotentially more costly and\nmay impact its results of\noperations. U.S. and other\nregulators globally have\nimplemented and continue to\ndiscuss various changes to\ncertain regulatory\nrequirements, which would\nrequire ongoing assessment by\nmanagement as to the impact to\nCiti, its businesses and\nbusiness planning. Business\nplanning must necessarily be\nbased on possible or proposed\nrules or outcomes, which can\nchange significantly upon\nfinalization, or upon\nimplementation or interpretive\nguidance from numerous\nregulatory bodies worldwide,\nand such guidance can change.\nRegulatory and legislative\nchanges have also\nsignificantly increased Citi\u2019s\ncompliance risks and costs\n(see the implementation and\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges risk factor below) and\ncan adversely affect Citi\u2019s\ncompetitive position, as well\nas its businesses, revenues,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nCiti\u2019s Ability to Achieve Its\nObjectives from Its\nTransformation, Simplification\nand Other Priorities May Not\nBe as Successful as It\nProjects or Expects.\n\nAs part of its multiyear\ntransformation, Citi continues\nto make significant\ninvestments and undertake\nsubstantial actions across the\nCompany to improve its risk\nand controls environment,\nmodernize its data and\ntechnology infrastructure and\nfurther enhance safety and\nsoundness (see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and \u201cCiti\u2019s Multiyear\nTransformation\u201d above and the\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factor\nbelow).\n\nCiti has also been pursuing\noverall simplification\ninitiatives that have included\nmanagement and operating model\nchanges and actions to enhance\nfocus on clients and reduce\nexpenses. Citi\u2019s\nsimplification actions also\ninclude completing its\nremaining divestitures,\nincluding the planned IPO of\nMexico Consumer/SBMM. These\nsimplification initiatives\ninvolve various execution\nchallenges, may take longer\nthan expected and may result\nin higher than expected\nexpenses, CTA and other losses\nor other negative financial or\nstrategic impacts, which could\nbe material, and litigation\nand regulatory scrutiny (for\ninformation about potential\nCTA impacts, see the capital\nreturn risk factor above and\nthe incorrect assumptions or\nestimates and emerging markets\nrisk factors below).\n\nAdditionally, Citi continues\nto make business-led\ninvestments, as part of the\nexecution of its strategic\npriorities. For example, Citi\nhas been making investments\nacross the Company, including\nhiring front office employees\nin key strategic markets and\nbusinesses; enhancing product\ncapabilities and platforms to\ngrow key businesses, improve\nclient digital experiences and\nadd scalability; and\nimplementing new capabilities\nand partnerships. These\nbusiness-led investments are\ndesigned to reduce expenses\nand grow revenues as well as\nresult in retention and\nefficiency improvements.\n\nCiti\u2019s transformation, as well\nas its simplification and\nbusiness investment\ninitiatives, involve\nsignificant complexities and\nuncertainties. In addition,\nthere is inherent risk that\nthese initiatives will not be\nas productive or effective as\nCiti expects, or at all.\nConversely, failure to\nadequately invest in and\nupgrade Citi\u2019s technology and\nprocesses or properly\nimplement its enterprise-wide\nsimplification could result in\nCiti\u2019s inability to meet\nregulatory expectations, be\n\nsufficiently competitive,\nserve clients effectively and\navoid disruptions to its\nbusinesses and operational\nerrors (see the operational\nprocesses and systems and\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factors\nbelow).\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to achieve its\nexpected returns, including\nexpense savings and revenue\ngrowth objectives, and\noperational improvements from\nthese priorities depends, in\npart, on factors that it\ncannot control, including,\namong others, macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties;\ncustomer, client and\ncompetitor actions; and\nongoing regulatory\nrequirements or changes.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, simplification\nand other priorities may\ncontinue to evolve as its\nbusiness strategies, the\nmarket environment and\nregulatory expectations\nchange, which could make the\ninitiatives more costly and\nmore challenging to implement,\nand limit their effectiveness.\n\nClimate Change Presents\nVarious Financial and Non-\nFinancial Risks to Citi and\nIts Customers and Clients.\n\nClimate change presents both\nimmediate and long-term risks\nto Citi and its customers and\nclients, with the risks\nexpected to increase over\ntime. Climate risks can arise\nfrom both physical risks\n(those risks related to the\nphysical effects of climate\nchange) and transition risks\n(risks related to regulatory,\nmarket, technological,\nstakeholder and legal changes\nfrom a transition to a low-\ncarbon economy). Physical and\ntransition risks can manifest\nthemselves differently across\nCiti\u2019s risk categories in the\nshort, medium and long terms.\n\nPhysical risks from climate\nchange include acute risks,\nsuch as wildfires, hurricanes,\nfloods and droughts, as well\nas consequences of chronic\nchanges in climate, such as\nrising sea levels, prolonged\ndroughts and systemic changes\nto geographies and any\nresulting population\nmigration. For example,\nphysical risks could have\nadverse financial, operational\nand other impacts on Citi,\nboth directly on its business\nand operations, and indirectly\nas a result of impacts to\nCiti\u2019s clients, customers,\nvendors and other\ncounterparties. These impacts\ncan include destruction,\ndamage or impairment of owned\nor leased properties and other\nassets, destruction or\ndeterioration of the value of\ncollateral, such as real\nestate, disruptions to\nbusiness operations and supply\nchains, and reduced\navailability or increase in\nthe cost of insurance.\nPhysical risks can also impact\nCiti\u2019s credit risk exposures,\nfor example, in its mortgage\nand commercial real estate\nlending businesses.\n\nTransition risks may arise\nfrom changes in regulations or\nmarket preferences toward low-\ncarbon industries or sectors,\nwhich in turn could have\nnegative impacts on asset\nvalues, results of operations\nor the reputations of Citi and\nits customers and clients. For\nexample, Citi\u2019s corporate\ncredit exposures include oil\nand gas, power and other\nindustries that may experience\nreduced demand for carbon-\nintensive products due to the\ntransition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Failure to adequately\nconsider transition risk in\ndeveloping and executing on\nits business strategy could\nlead to a loss of market\nshare, lower revenues and\nhigher credit costs.\nTransition risks also include\npotential increased\noperational, compliance and\nenergy costs driven by\ngovernment policies to promote\ndecarbonization.\n                               52                               \nMoreover, increasing\nlegislative and regulatory\nchanges and uncertainties\nregarding climate-related risk\nmanagement and disclosures may\nresult in increased\nregulatory, compliance,\ncredit, reputational and other\nrisks and costs for Citi. In\naddition, Citi could face\nincreased regulatory scrutiny\nand reputation and litigation\nrisks as a result of its\nclimate risk, sustainability\nand other environmental and\nsocial commitments,\ndisclosures, marketing and\npositioning. For example, any\nactual or perceived\noverstatement of the\nenvironmental benefits of\nCiti\u2019s actions may result in\nlegal or regulatory actions\nand/or reputational harm.\n\nEven as some regulators seek\nto mandate additional\ndisclosure of climate-related\ninformation, Citi\u2019s ability to\ncomply with such requirements\nand conduct more robust\nclimate-related risk analyses\nmay be hampered by lack of\ninformation and reliable data.\nData on climate-related risks\nis limited in availability,\noften based on estimated or\nunverified figures, collected\nand reported on a time-lag,\nand variable in quality.\nModeling capabilities to\nanalyze climate-related risks\nand interconnections continue\nto evolve.\n\nAdditionally, if Citi is\nunable to achieve its\nobjectives or commitments\nrelating to climate change,\nits businesses, reputation,\nattractiveness to certain\ninvestors and efforts to\nrecruit and retain employees\nmay suffer. For example,\nCiti\u2019s approach to supporting\nclient decarbonization in a\ngradual and orderly way, while\npromoting energy security, may\nlead to both continued\nexposure to carbon-intensive\nactivity and increased\nreputation risks from\nstakeholders with divergent\npoints of view. Citi may also\nface challenges and scrutiny\nfrom stakeholders with varied\nviews on climate change that\nmay impact its ability to\nconduct certain business.\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nclimate and other\nsustainability initiatives,\nsee \u201cNet Zero and\nSustainability\u201d below.

Of\nthis deducted amount, $11.6\nbillion related to net\noperating losses, foreign tax\ncredit and general business\ncredit carry-forwards, with\n$3.0 billion related to\ntemporary differences in\nexcess of the 10%/15%\nregulatory limitations,\nreduced by $1.8 billion of\ndeferred tax liabilities,\nprimarily associated with\ngoodwill and certain other\nintangible assets that were\nseparately deducted from\ncapital.\n\nCiti\u2019s overall ability to\nrealize its DTAs will\nprimarily be dependent upon\nCiti\u2019s ability to generate\nU.S. taxable income in the\nrelevant reversal periods.\nFailure to realize any portion\nof the net DTAs would have a\ncorresponding negative impact\non Citi\u2019s net income and\nfinancial returns.\n\nThe accounting treatment for\nrealization of DTAs is complex\nand requires significant\njudgment and estimates\nregarding future taxable\nearnings in the jurisdictions\nin which the DTAs arise and\navailable tax planning\nstrategies. Forecasts\n\nof future taxable earnings\nwill depend upon various\nfactors, including, among\nothers, macroeconomic\nconditions. In addition, any\nfuture increase in U.S.\ncorporate tax rates could\nresult in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s DTAs, which may subject\nmore of Citi\u2019s DTAs to\nexclusion from regulatory\ncapital.\n\nCiti has not been and does not\nexpect to be subject to the\nbase erosion anti-abuse tax\n(BEAT), which, if applicable\nto Citi in any given year,\nwould have a significantly\nadverse effect on both Citi\u2019s\nnet income and regulatory\ncapital.\n\nThe new U.S. administration\nhas discussed potential\nreductions to the U.S. federal\ncorporate tax rate and changes\nto the U.S. approach to the\nOrganization for Economic\nCooperation and Development\n(OECD) Pillar 2 framework. It\nis unclear whether any\ncorporate tax rate reduction\nwould apply to services\ncompanies like Citi. If the\nU.S. federal corporate tax\nrate applicable to Citi is\nreduced, Citi may benefit on a\nprospective net income basis,\nbut the reduction could result\nin a material decrease in the\nvalue of Citi\u2019s DTAs, which\nwould also result in a\nmaterial reduction to Citi\u2019s\nnet income during the period\nin which the change is\nenacted. Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital could also be reduced\nif the decrease in the value\nof Citi\u2019s DTAs exceeds certain\nlevels.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s DTAs, including FTCs,\nsee \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d below\nand Notes 1 and 10.\n\nCiti\u2019s Interpretation or\nApplication of the Complex Tax\nLaws to Which It Is Subject\nCould Differ from Those of\nGovernmental Authorities,\nWhich Could Result in\nLitigation or Examinations and\nthe Payment of Additional\nTaxes, Penalties or Interest.\n\nCiti is subject to various\nincome-based tax laws of the\nU.S. and its states and\nmunicipalities, as well as the\nnumerous non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which it\noperates. These tax laws are\ninherently complex, and Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these laws to\nits entities, operations and\nbusinesses.\n\nFor example, the OECD Pillar 2\nframework contemplates a 15%\nglobal minimum tax with\nrespect to earnings in each\ncountry. The majority of EU\nmember states have adopted the\nOECD Pillar 2 rules, and other\nnon-U.S. countries have\nsimilarly adopted or are\nexpected to adopt the rules.\nUnder these rules, Citi will\nbe required to pay a \u201ctop-up\u201d\ntax to the extent that Citi\u2019s\neffective tax rate in any\ngiven country is below 15%.\nBeginning in 2024, countries\nthat adopted the OECD Pillar 2\nrules can collect the top-up\ntax only with respect to\nearnings of entities in their\njurisdiction or subsidiaries\nof such entities. Beginning in\n2025, all countries that have\nadopted the OECD Pillar 2\nrules can collect a share of\nthe top-up tax owed with\nrespect to any member of the\nPillar 2 multinational group.\nWhile Citi does not currently\nexpect the rules to have a\nmaterial impact on its\nearnings, many aspects of the\napplication of the rules and\ntheir implementation remain\nuncertain. Separately, the new\nU.S. administration has stated\nits opposition to the\napplication of the global\nminimum tax to U.S. companies\u2019\nU.S. operations, and has\nindicated it may take\nretaliatory measures against\nother countries that seek to\ncollect the minimum tax with\nrespect to the U.S. operations\nof U.S. companies. Citi is\n                               53                               \nclosely monitoring\ndevelopments relating to the\nPillar 2 negotiations to\ndetermine their potential\nimpact.\n\nAdditionally, Citi is subject\nto litigation or examinations\nwith U.S. and non-U.S. tax\nauthorities regarding non-\nincome-based tax matters.\nWhile Citi has appropriately\nreserved for such matters\nwhere there is a probable\nloss, and has disclosed\nreasonably possible losses,\nthe outcome of the matters may\nbe different than Citi\u2019s\nexpectations. Citi\u2019s\ninterpretations or application\nof the tax laws, including\nwith respect to withholding,\nstamp, service and other non-\nincome taxes, could differ\nfrom that of the relevant\ngovernmental taxing authority,\nwhich could result in the\nrequirement to pay additional\ntaxes, penalties or interest,\nthe reduction of certain tax\nbenefits or the requirement to\nmake adjustments to amounts\nrecorded, which could be\nmaterial. See Note 30 for\nadditional information on\nlitigation and examinations\ninvolving non-U.S. tax\nauthorities.\n\nA Deterioration in or Failure\nto Maintain Citi\u2019s Co-Branding\nor Private Label Credit Card\nRelationships Could Have a\nNegative Impact on Citi.\n\nCiti has co-branding and\nprivate label relationships\nwith various retailers and\nmerchants through its Branded\nCards and Retail Services\ncredit card businesses in USPB\n, whereby in the ordinary\ncourse of business Citi issues\ncredit cards to consumers,\nincluding customers of the\nretailers or merchants. The\nfive largest relationships\nacross both businesses in USPB\nconstituted an aggregate of\napproximately 12% of Citi\u2019s\nrevenues in 2024 (see \u201c U.S.\nPersonal Banking \u201d above).\nCiti\u2019s co-branding and private\nlabel agreements often provide\nfor shared economics between\nthe parties and generally have\na fixed term.\n\nCompetition among credit card\nissuers, including Citi, for\nthese relationships is\nsignificant, and Citi may not\nbe able to maintain such\nrelationships on existing\nterms or at all. Citi\u2019s co-\nbranding and private label\nrelationships could also be\nnegatively impacted by, among\nother things, the general\neconomic environment,\nincluding the impacts stemming\nfrom potential increases in\nunemployment, inflation or\ninterest rates or lower\neconomic growth rates, as well\nas a risk of recession;\nchanges in consumer sentiment,\nspending patterns and credit\ncard usage behaviors; a\ndecline in sales and revenues,\npartner store closures, any\nreduction in air and business\ntravel, or other operational\ndifficulties of the retailer\nor merchant; changes in\npartner business strategies,\nincluding changes in products\nand services offered;\ntermination or non-renewal of\npartner agreements, including\nearly termination due to a\ncontractual breach or exercise\nof other early termination\nright; or other factors,\nincluding bankruptcies,\nliquidations, restructurings,\nconsolidations or other\nsimilar events, whether due to\na challenging macroeconomic\nenvironment or otherwise.\n\nThese events, particularly\nearly termination and\nbankruptcies or liquidations,\ncould negatively impact the\nresults of operations or\nfinancial condition of Branded\nCards, Retail Services or Citi\nas a whole, including as a\nresult of loss of revenues,\nincreased expenses, higher\ncost of credit, impairment of\npurchased credit card\nrelationships and contract-\nrelated intangibles or other\nlosses (see Note 17 for\ninformation on Citi\u2019s credit\ncard related intangibles\ngenerally).\n\nThe Application of U.S.\nResolution Plan Requirements\nMay Pose a Greater Risk of\nLoss to Citi\u2019s Debt and Equity\nSecurities Holders, and Citi\u2019s\nInability in Its Resolution\nPlan Submissions to Address\nAny Shortcomings or\nDeficiencies or Guidance Could\nSubject Citi to More Stringent\nCapital, Leverage or Liquidity\nRequirements, or Restrictions\non Its Growth, Activities or\nOperations, and Could\nEventually Require Citi to\nDivest Assets or Operations.\n\nTitle I of the Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires Citi to prepare and\nsubmit a plan to the FRB and\nthe FDIC for the orderly\nresolution of Citigroup (the\nbank holding company) and its\nsignificant legal entities\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\nin the event of future\nmaterial financial distress or\nfailure.\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s preferred \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d resolution\nplan strategy, only Citigroup,\nthe parent holding company,\nwould enter into bankruptcy,\nwhile Citigroup\u2019s material\nlegal entities (as defined in\nthe public section of its 2023\nresolution plan, which can be\nfound on the FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s\nwebsites) would remain\noperational outside of any\nresolution or insolvency\nproceedings. As a result,\nCitigroup\u2019s losses and any\nlosses incurred by its\nmaterial legal entity\nsubsidiaries would be imposed\nfirst on holders of\nCitigroup\u2019s equity securities\nand thereafter on its\nunsecured creditors, including\nholders of eligible long-term\ndebt and other debt\nsecurities.\n\nIn addition, a wholly owned,\ndirect subsidiary of Citigroup\nserves as a resolution funding\nvehicle (the intermediate\nholding company, or IHC) to\nwhich Citigroup has\ntransferred, and has agreed to\ntransfer on an ongoing basis,\ncertain assets. The\nobligations of Citigroup and\nof the IHC, respectively,\nunder the amended and restated\nsecured support agreement, are\nsecured on a senior basis by\nthe assets of Citigroup (other\nthan shares in subsidiaries of\nthe parent company and certain\nother assets), and the assets\nof the IHC, as applicable. As\na result, claims of the\noperating material legal\nentities against the assets of\nCitigroup with respect to such\nsecured assets are effectively\nsenior to unsecured\nobligations of Citigroup.\nCiti\u2019s single point of entry\nresolution plan strategy and\nthe obligations under the\namended and restated secured\nsupport agreement may result\nin the recapitalization of\nand/or provision of liquidity\nto Citi\u2019s operating material\nlegal entities, and the\ncommencement of bankruptcy\nproceedings by Citigroup at an\nearlier stage of financial\nstress than might otherwise\noccur without such mechanisms\nin place.\n\nIn line with the FRB\u2019s total\nloss-absorbing capacity (TLAC)\nrule, Citigroup\u2019s shareholders\nand unsecured\ncreditors\u2014including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders\u2014would bear any losses\nresulting from Citigroup\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Accordingly, any\nvalue realized by holders of\nits unsecured long-term debt\nmay not be sufficient to repay\nthe amounts owed to such debt\nholders in the event of a\nbankruptcy or other resolution\nproceeding of Citigroup. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s single point of entry\nresolution plan strategy and\nthe IHC and secured support\nagreement, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nOn November 22, 2022, the FRB\nand FDIC issued feedback on\nthe resolution plans filed on\nJuly 1, 2021 by the eight U.S.\nGSIBs, including Citigroup.\nThe FRB and FDIC jointly\nidentified one shortcoming in\nCitigroup\u2019s 2021 resolution\nplan. The shortcoming related\nto data integrity and\n                               54                               \ndata quality management\nissues, specifically,\nweaknesses in Citi\u2019s processes\nand practices for producing\ncertain data that could\nmaterially impact its\nresolution capabilities. On\nJune 20, 2024, the FRB and\nFDIC issued feedback on the\nresolution plans filed on July\n1, 2023 by the eight U.S.\nGSIBs, including Citigroup.\nThe FRB and FDIC jointly\nidentified one shortcoming in\nCitigroup\u2019s 2023 resolution\nplan regarding Citi\u2019s\nderivatives unwind\ncapabilities. If a shortcoming\nis not satisfactorily\nexplained or addressed before,\nor in, the submission of the\nnext resolution plan, the\nshortcoming may be found to be\na deficiency in the next\nresolution plan (see\ndiscussion below). Citi is\nrequired to submit a targeted\nresolution plan by July 1,\n2025. More generally, data\ncontinues to be a subject of\nregulatory focus, and Citi\ncontinues to work on enhancing\nits data availability and\nquality (see \u201cCiti\u2019s Multiyear\nTransformation\u201d above and the\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factor\nbelow).\n\nUnder Title I, if the FRB and\nthe FDIC jointly determine\nthat Citi\u2019s resolution plan is\nnot \u201ccredible\u201d (which,\nalthough not defined, is\ngenerally understood to mean\nthe regulators do not believe\nthe plan is feasible or would\notherwise allow Citi to be\nresolved in a way that\nprotects systemically\nimportant functions without\nsevere systemic disruption),\nor would not facilitate an\norderly resolution of Citi\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, and Citi fails to\nresubmit a resolution plan\nthat remedies any identified\ndeficiencies, Citi could be\nsubjected to more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements, or restrictions\non its growth, activities or\noperations. If within two\nyears from the imposition of\nany such requirements or\nrestrictions Citi has still\nnot remediated any identified\ndeficiencies, then Citi could\neventually be required to\ndivest certain assets or\noperations. Any such\nrestrictions or actions would\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nreputation, market and\ninvestor perception,\noperations and strategy.\n\nCiti\u2019s Performance and Its\nAbility to Effectively Execute\nIts Transformation,\nSimplification and Other\nPriorities Could Be Negatively\nImpacted if It Is Not Able to\nHire and Retain Qualified\nEmployees.\n\nCiti\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of its individual\nbusinesses largely depend on\nthe talents and efforts of its\ndiverse and highly qualified\nemployees. Specifically,\nCiti\u2019s continued ability to\ncompete in each of its lines\nof business, to manage its\nbusinesses effectively and to\nexecute its transformation,\nsimplification and other\npriorities, including, for\nexample, hiring employees to\ngrow businesses or hiring\nemployees to support Citi\u2019s\npriorities, depends on its\nability to hire new employees\nand to retain and motivate its\nexisting employees. If Citi is\nunable to continue to hire,\nretain and motivate highly\nqualified employees, Citi\u2019s\nperformance, including its\ncompetitive position, the\nexecution of its\ntransformation, simplification\nand other priorities and its\nresults of operations could be\nnegatively impacted.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to attract,\nretain and motivate employees\ndepends on numerous factors,\nsome of which are outside of\nCiti\u2019s control. For example,\nthe competition for talent\ncontinues to be particularly\nintense due to various\nfactors, such as changes in\nworker expectations, concerns\nand preferences, including\ndemands for remote work\noptions and other job\n\nflexibility. Also, the banking\nindustry generally is subject\nto more comprehensive\nregulation of employee\ncompensation than other\nindustries, including deferral\nand clawback requirements for\nincentive compensation, which\ncan make it unusually\nchallenging for Citi to\ncompete in labor markets\nagainst businesses, including,\nfor example, technology\ncompanies, that are not\nsubject to such regulation. In\naddition, Citi recently\ncompleted a significant\norganizational simplification\ninitiative, which included\nreducing management layers and\nsignificant reductions in\nfunctional roles that could\ncontinue to impact its ability\nto attract and retain\nemployees.\n\nOther factors that could\nimpact Citi\u2019s ability to\nattract, retain and motivate\nemployees include, among other\nthings, Citi\u2019s presence in a\nparticular market or region,\nthe professional and\ndevelopment opportunities it\noffers, its reputation and its\ndiversity. For information on\nCiti\u2019s employee and workforce\nmanagement, see \u201cHuman Capital\nResources and Management\u201d\nbelow.\n\nCiti Faces Increased\nCompetitive Challenges,\nIncluding from Financial\nServices and Other Companies\nand Emerging Technologies.\n\nCiti operates in an\nincreasingly evolving and\ncompetitive business\nenvironment, which includes\nboth financial and non-\nfinancial services firms, such\nas traditional banks, online\nbanks, private credit and\nfinancial technology companies\nand others. These companies\ncompete on the basis of, among\nother factors, size, reach,\nquality and type of products\nand services offered, price,\ntechnology and reputation.\nCertain competitors may be\nsubject to different and, in\nsome cases, less stringent\nlegal, regulatory and\nsupervisory requirements,\nwhether due to size,\njurisdiction, entity type or\nother factors, placing Citi at\na competitive disadvantage.\nMoreover, new or rapidly\ndeveloping technologies with\nthe potential to have\nsignificant economic or social\neffects (emerging\ntechnologies) also pose\ncompetitive challenges for\nCiti.\n\nFor example, Citi competes\nwith other financial services\ncompanies in the U.S. and\nglobally that have grown\nrapidly over the last several\nyears or have introduced new\nproducts and services.\nPotential mergers and\nacquisitions involving\ntraditional financial services\ncompanies, such as regional\nbanks or credit card issuers,\nas well as networks and\nmerchant acquirers, may also\nincrease competition and\nimpact Citi\u2019s ability to offer\ncompetitive pricing and\nrewards. Non-traditional\nfinancial services firms, such\nas private credit, financial\ntechnology and digital asset\ncompanies, are less regulated\nand supervised and continue to\nexpand their offerings of\nservices traditionally\nprovided by financial\ninstitutions.\n\nIn addition, emerging\ntechnologies have the\npotential to intensify\ncompetition and accelerate\ndisruption in the financial\nservices industry. Clients and\ninvestors have shown increased\ninterest in these\ntechnologies, prompting\nfinancial services firms and\nother market participants to\ndevelop related products and\nservices. As blockchain and\ndigital assets continue to\nevolve, customer demand for\nenhanced offerings may\nincrease. Failure to\nstrategically embrace the\npotential of emerging\ntechnologies may result in a\ncompetitive disadvantage to\nCiti. The new U.S.\nadministration has stated its\nsupport for the growth and use\nof digital assets and\n                               55                               \nblockchain technology,\nincluding a more favorable\nregulatory approach to crypto\nassets. Citi may not be able\nto provide the same or similar\nproducts and services for\nlegal or regulatory reasons,\nwhich may be exacerbated by\nrapidly evolving and\nconflicting regulatory\nrequirements, as well as\nincreased compliance and other\nrisks. Further, the\nintroduction of mobile\nplatforms and emerging\ntechnologies, such as\nartificial intelligence (AI)\nand digital assets, and\nchanges in the payments space\n(e.g., instant and 24/7\npayments) are accelerating,\nand, as a result, certain of\nCiti\u2019s products and services\ncould become less competitive.\n\nIncreased competition and\nemerging technologies have\nrequired and could require\nCiti to change or adapt its\nproducts and services, as well\nas invest in and develop\nrelated infrastructure, to\nattract and retain customers\nor clients or to compete more\neffectively with competitors,\nincluding new market entrants.\n\nSimultaneously, as Citi\ndevelops new products and\nservices leveraging emerging\ntechnologies, new risks may\nemerge that, if not designed\nand governed adequately, may\nresult in control gaps and in\nCiti operating outside of its\nrisk appetite. For example,\nthe use or development of\nemerging technologies, such as\nAI or digital assets, without\nsufficient controls,\ngovernance and risk management\nmay result in increased risks\nacross various risk categories\n(for additional information,\nsee the operational processes\nand systems risk factor\nbelow).\n\nAs another example, instant\nand 24/7 payments products\ncould be accompanied by\nchallenges to forecasting and\nmanaging liquidity, as well as\nincreased operational and\ncompliance risks.\nAdditionally, the growth of\ncertain competitors has\nincreased market and\ncounterparty credit risks,\nwith such risks particularly\nheightened in the case of a\nchallenging macroeconomic\nenvironment (see the risk\nfactor on credit and\nconcentrations of risk below).\n\nMoreover, Citi relies on third\nparties to support certain of\nits product and service\nofferings, which may put Citi\nat a disadvantage to\ncompetitors who may directly\noffer a broader array of\nproducts and services. Also,\nCiti\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and reputation may\nsuffer if any third party is\nunable to provide adequate\nsupport for such product and\nservice offerings, whether due\nto operational incidents or\notherwise (see the operational\nprocesses and systems,\ncybersecurity and emerging\nmarkets risk factors below).\n\nTo the extent that Citi is not\nable to compete effectively\nwith other financial services\ncompanies, including private\ncredit and financial\ntechnology companies, and non-\nfinancial services firms, or\nadequately assess the\ncompetitive landscape, Citi\ncould be placed at a\ncompetitive disadvantage,\nwhich could result in loss of\ncustomers and market share,\nand its businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition could suffer. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s competitors, see the\nco-brand and private label\ncards and qualified employees\nrisk factors above and\n\u201cSupervision, Regulation and\nOther\u2014Competition\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISKS                                             \n                                                                \nA Failure or Disruption of\nCiti\u2019s Operational Processes\nor Systems Could Negatively\nImpact Its Reputation,\nCustomers, Clients, Businesses\nor Results of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\n\nCiti\u2019s global operations rely\nheavily on its technology\nsystems and infrastructure,\nincluding the accurate,\ncomplete, timely and secure\nprocessing, management,\nstorage and transmission of\ndata, including confidential\ntransactions, and other\ninformation, as well as the\nmonitoring of a substantial\namount of data and complex\ntransactions in real time.\nCiti obtains and stores an\nextensive amount of personal\nand client-specific\ninformation for its consumer\nand institutional customers\nand clients, and must\naccurately record and reflect\ntheir account transactions.\n\nCiti\u2019s operations must also\ncomply with complex and\nevolving laws, regulations and\nheightened regulatory\nexpectations in the\njurisdictions in which it\noperates (see the\nimplementation and\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges and legal proceedings\nrisk factors below). With the\nproliferation of emerging\ntechnologies, including AI,\nand the use of the internet,\nmobile devices and cloud\nservices to conduct financial\ntransactions, and customers\u2019\nand clients\u2019 increasing use of\nonline banking and trading\nsystems and other platforms,\nlarge global financial\ninstitutions such as Citi have\nbeen, and will continue to be,\nsubject to an ever-increasing\nrisk of operational loss,\nfailure or disruption.\n\nCiti has been working with AI\nand machine learning for a\nperiod of time and has more\nrecently begun using\nGenerative AI, a type of\nartificial intelligence that\nuses generative models to\ncreate text and other content.\nGenerative AI tools are\navailable to employees within\nparts of the Company, and in\nthe future Citi may more\nbroadly use, develop and\nincorporate Generative AI\nwithin its technology platform\nand services, systems and its\nbusinesses and functions.\nWhile Citi has policies which\ngovern the use of emerging\ntechnologies, ineffective,\ninadequate or faulty\nGenerative AI development or\ndeployment practices by Citi\nor third parties could result\nin unintended consequences,\nsuch as AI algorithms that\nproduce inaccurate or\nincomplete output or output\nbased on biased, incomplete\nand/or inaccurate datasets, or\ncause other issues, concerns\nor deficiencies. Moreover, the\nuse of increasingly\nsophisticated AI technologies\nby malicious actors and others\nhas increased the risk of\nfraud, including identity\ntheft and bypassing of\nverification controls, and\nfailure to effectively manage\nsuch risks could result in\nmisappropriation of funds,\nunauthorized transactions,\nexposure of sensitive client\nor Company information,\nreputational harm and\nincreased litigation and\nregulatory risk. In addition,\ncompliance with new or\nchanging laws, regulations or\nindustry standards relating to\nAI may impose additional\noperational risks and costs.\n\nAlthough Citi has continued to\nupgrade its technology,\nincluding systems to automate\nprocesses and gain\nefficiencies, operational\nincidents are unpredictable\nand can arise from numerous\nsources, not all of which are\nfully within Citi\u2019s control.\nThese include, among others,\noperational or execution\nfailures or deficiencies by\nthird parties and third\nparties that provide products\nor services to Citi (e.g.,\ncloud service\n                               56                               \nproviders), including such\nthird parties\u2019 downstream\nservice providers, other\nmarket participants or those\nthat otherwise have an ongoing\npartnership or business\nrelationship with Citi;\ndeficiencies in processes or\ncontrols; inadequate\nmanagement of data governance\npractices, data controls and\nmonitoring mechanisms that may\nadversely impact internal or\nexternal reporting and\ndecision-making; cyber or\ninformation security incidents\n(see the cybersecurity risk\nfactor below); human error,\nsuch as manual transaction\nprocessing errors (e.g.,\nerroneous payments to lenders\nor manual errors by traders\nthat cause system and market\ndisruptions or losses), which\ncan be exacerbated by staffing\nchallenges and processing\nbacklogs; fraud or malice on\nthe part of employees or third\nparties; insufficient (or\nlimited) straight-through\nprocessing between legacy or\nbespoke systems and any\nfailure to design and\neffectively operate controls\nthat mitigate operational\nrisks associated with those\nlegacy or bespoke systems,\nleading to potential risk of\nerrors and operating losses;\naccidental system or\ntechnological failure;\nelectrical or\ntelecommunication outages;\nfailures of or cyber incidents\ninvolving computer servers or\ninfrastructure, including\nsoftware updates and cloud\nservices; or other similar\nlosses or damage to Citi\u2019s\nproperty or assets (see also\nthe climate change risk factor\nabove). Additionally, Citi\u2019s\nability to effectively\nmaintain and upgrade systems\nand infrastructure can become\nmore challenging as the speed,\nfrequency, volume,\ninterconnectivity and\ncomplexity of transactions\ncontinue to increase.\n\nFor example, operational\nincidents can arise due to\nfailures by third parties with\nwhich Citi does business, such\nas failures by internet,\nmobile technology and cloud\nservice providers or other\nvendors to adequately follow\nprocedures or processes,\nsafeguard their systems or\nprevent system disruptions or\ncyberattacks. Failure by Citi\nto develop, implement and\noperate a third-party risk\nmanagement program\ncommensurate with the level of\nrisk, complexity and nature of\nits third-party relationships\ncan also result in operational\nincidents. In addition, Citi\nhas experienced and could\nexperience further losses\nassociated with manual\ntransaction processing errors,\nincluding erroneous payments\nto lenders or manual errors by\nCiti traders that cause system\nand market disruptions and\nlosses for Citi and its\nclients. Irrespective of the\nsophistication of the\ntechnology utilized by Citi,\nthere will always be some room\nfor human and other errors. In\nview of the large transactions\nin which Citi engages, such\nerrors have in the past\nresulted, and could result, in\nsignificant losses. While Citi\nhas change management\nprocesses in place to\nappropriately upgrade its\noperational processes and\nsystems to ensure that any\nchanges introduced do not\nadversely impact security and\noperational continuity, such\nchange management can fail or\nbe ineffective. Furthermore,\nwhen Citi introduces new\nproducts, systems or\nprocesses, new operational\nrisks that may arise from\nthose changes may not be\nidentified, or adequate\ncontrols to mitigate the\nidentified risks may not be\nappropriately implemented or\noperate as designed.\n\nIncidents that impact\ninformation security,\ntechnology operations or other\noperational processes may\ncause disruptions and/or\nmalfunctions within Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses (e.g., the\ntemporary loss of availability\nof Citi\u2019s online banking\nsystem or mobile banking\nplatform), as well as the\noperations of its clients,\ncustomers or other third\nparties. In addition,\n\noperational incidents could\ninvolve the failure or\nineffectiveness of internal\nprocesses or controls. Given\nCiti\u2019s global footprint and\nthe high volume of\ntransactions processed by\nCiti, certain failures, errors\nor actions may be repeated or\ncompounded before they are\ndiscovered and rectified,\nwhich would further increase\nthe consequences and costs.\nOperational incidents could\nresult in financial losses and\nother costs as well as\nmisappropriation, corruption\nor loss of confidential and\nother information or assets,\nwhich could significantly\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nreputation, customers,\nclients, businesses or results\nof operations and financial\ncondition. Cyber-related and\nother operational incidents\ncan also result in legal and\nregulatory actions or\nproceedings, fines and other\ncosts (see the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below).\n\nCiti will need to continue to\nincrease its operational\nresilience, ensuring important\nbusiness services and their\nimpact tolerance time and\nseverity scales are clearly\ndefined. Failure to do so\ncould expose Citi to service\ndisruptions identified through\nscenario testing, leading to\nharms to Citi clients, market\nintegrity, financial stability\nor Citi safety and soundness.\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nmanagement of operational\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s and Third Parties\u2019\nComputer Systems and Networks\nWill Continue to Be\nSusceptible to an Increasing\nRisk of Continually Evolving,\nSophisticated Cybersecurity\nIncidents That Could Result in\nthe Theft, Loss, Non-\nAvailability, Misuse or\nDisclosure of Confidential\nClient or Customer\nInformation, Damage to Citi\u2019s\nReputation, Additional Costs\nto Citi, Regulatory Penalties,\nLegal Exposure and Financial\nLosses.\n\nCiti\u2019s computer systems,\nsoftware and networks are\nsubject to ongoing attempted\ncyberattacks, such as\nunauthorized access, loss or\ndestruction of data (including\nconfidential client\ninformation), account\ntakeovers, disruptions of\nservice, phishing, malware,\nransomware, computer viruses\nor other malicious code and\nother similar events. These\nthreats can arise from\nexternal parties, including\ncyber criminals, cyber\nterrorists, hacktivists\n(individuals or groups using\ncyberattacks to promote a\npolitical or social agenda)\nand nation-state actors, as\nwell as insiders who knowingly\nor unknowingly engage in or\nenable malicious cyber\nactivities. For example,\nnation-state actors have\nrecently targeted critical\nU.S. infrastructure with\ncyberattacks.\n\nCiti develops its own software\nand relies on third-party\napplications and software,\nwhich are susceptible to\nvulnerability exploitations.\nSoftware leveraged in\nfinancial services and other\nindustries continues to be\nimpacted by an increasing\nnumber of zero-day\nvulnerabilities, thus\nincreasing inherent cyber risk\nto Citi.\n\nThe increasing use of mobile\nand other digital banking\nplatforms and services, cloud\ntechnologies, new and emerging\ntechnologies (such as AI) and\nconnectivity solutions to\nfacilitate remote working for\nCiti\u2019s employees all increase\nCiti\u2019s exposure to\ncybersecurity risks. Citi is\nalso susceptible to\ncyberattacks given, among\nother things, its size and\nscale, high-profile brand,\nglobal footprint and prominent\nrole in the financial system,\nas well as the ongoing wind-\ndown of its\n                               57                               \nbusinesses in Russia (see the\nemerging markets risk factor\nand \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d below).\nAdditionally, Citi continues\nto operate in multiple\njurisdictions in the midst of\ngeopolitical unrest or\nuncertainties, including the\nRussia\u2013Ukraine war and the\nconflicts in the Middle East,\nwhich could expose Citi to\nheightened risk of insider\nthreat, cyber threats from\nnation-state actors,\nhacktivism or other cyber\nincidents.\n\nCiti continues to experience\nincreased exposure to\ncyberattacks through third\nparties, in part because\nfinancial institutions are\nbecoming increasingly\ninterconnected with central\nagents, exchanges and clearing\nhouses. Third parties with\nwhich Citi does business, as\nwell as retailers and other\nthird parties with which\nCiti\u2019s customers do business,\nand any such third parties\u2019\ndownstream service providers,\nalso pose cybersecurity risks,\nparticularly where activities\nof customers are beyond Citi\u2019s\nsecurity and control systems.\nFor example, Citi outsources\ncertain functions, such as\nprocessing customer credit\ncard transactions, uploading\ncontent on customer-facing\nwebsites and developing\nsoftware for new products and\nservices. These relationships\nallow for the storage and\nprocessing of customer\ninformation by third-party\nhosting of, or access to, Citi\nwebsites. This could lead to\ncompromise or the potential to\nintroduce vulnerable or\nmalicious code, resulting in\nsecurity breaches or business\ndisruptions impacting Citi\ncustomers, employees or\noperations. While many of\nCiti\u2019s agreements with third\nparties include\nindemnification provisions,\nCiti may not be able to\nrecover sufficiently under\nthese provisions, or at all,\nto adequately offset any\nlosses and other adverse\nimpacts Citi may incur from\nthird-party cyber incidents.\n\nCiti and some of its third-\nparty partners have been\nsubjected to attempted and\nsometimes successful\ncyberattacks over the last\nseveral years, including (i)\ndenial of service attacks,\nwhich attempt to interrupt\nservice to clients and\ncustomers; (ii) hacking and\nmalicious software\ninstallations intended to gain\nunauthorized access to\ninformation systems or to\ndisrupt those systems and/or\nimpact availability or privacy\nof confidential data, with\nobjectives including, but not\nlimited to, extortion payments\nor causing reputational\ndamage; (iii) data breaches\ndue to unauthorized access to\ncustomer account or other\ndata; and (iv) malicious\nsoftware attacks on client\nsystems, in attempts to gain\nunauthorized access to Citi\nsystems or client data under\nthe guise of normal client\ntransactions.\n\nWhile Citi\u2019s monitoring and\nprotection services have\nhistorically generally\nsucceeded in detecting,\nthwarting and/or responding to\nattacks targeting its systems\nbefore they become\nsignificant, certain past\nincidents resulted in limited\nlosses, as well as increases\nin expenditures to monitor\nagainst the threat of similar\nfuture cyber incidents. There\ncan be no assurance that such\ncyber incidents will not occur\nagain, and they could occur\nmore frequently, via novel\ntactics, including leveraging\nof tools made possible by\nemerging technologies, and on\na more significant scale.\n\nDespite the significant\nresources Citi allocates to\nimplement, maintain, monitor\nand regularly upgrade its\nsystems and networks with\nmeasures such as intrusion\ndetection and prevention\nsystems and firewalls to\nsafeguard critical business\napplications, there is no\nguarantee that these\n\nmeasures or any other measures\ncan provide sufficient\nsecurity. Because the\ntechniques used to initiate\ncyberattacks change frequently\nor, in some cases, are not\nrecognized until launched or\neven later, Citi may be unable\nto implement effective\npreventive measures or\notherwise proactively address\nthese methods. In addition,\ncyber threats and cyberattack\ntechniques change, develop and\nevolve rapidly, including from\nemerging technologies such as\nAI, cloud computing and\nquantum computing. Given the\nfrequency and sophistication\nof cyberattacks, the\ndetermination of the severity\nand potential impact of a\ncyber incident may not become\napparent for a substantial\nperiod of time following\ndetection of the incident.\nAlso, while Citi strives to\nimplement measures to reduce\nthe exposure resulting from\noutsourcing risks, such as\nperforming security control\nassessments of third-party\nvendors and limiting third-\nparty access to the least\nprivileged level necessary to\nperform job functions, these\nmeasures cannot prevent all\nthird-party-related\ncyberattacks or data breaches.\nIn addition, the risk of\ninsider threats may continue\nto be elevated in the near\nterm due to Citi\u2019s recent\noverall simplification\ninitiatives, including\nstreamlining its global staff\nfunctions.\n\nCyber incidents can result in\nthe disclosure of personal,\nconfidential or proprietary\ncustomer, client or employee\ninformation; damage to Citi\u2019s\nreputation with its clients,\nother counterparties and the\nmarket; customer\ndissatisfaction; and\nadditional costs to Citi,\nincluding expenses such as\nrepairing or replacing\nsystems, replacing customer\npayment cards, credit\nmonitoring or adding new\npersonnel or protection\ntechnologies. Cyber incidents\ncan also result in regulatory\npenalties, loss of revenues,\ndeposit flight, exposure to\nlitigation and regulatory\naction and other financial\nlosses, including loss of\nfunds to both Citi and its\nclients and customers, and\ndisruption to Citi\u2019s\noperational systems (see the\noperational processes and\nsystems risk factor above).\n\nMoreover, the increasing risk\nof cyber incidents has\nresulted in increased\nlegislative and regulatory\naction on cybersecurity,\nincluding, among other things,\nscrutiny of firms\u2019\ncybersecurity protection\nprocesses and services, laws\nand regulations to enhance\nprotection of consumers\u2019\npersonal data and mandated\ndisclosure on cybersecurity\nmatters.\n\nWhile Citi maintains insurance\ncoverage that may, subject to\npolicy terms and conditions\nincluding significant self-\ninsured deductibles, cover\ncertain aspects of cyber\nrisks, such insurance coverage\nmay be insufficient to cover\nall losses and may not take\ninto account reputational\nharm, the costs of which are\nimpossible to quantify.\n\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s management of\ncybersecurity risk, see\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational\nRisk\u2014Cybersecurity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nChanges or Errors in\nAccounting Assumptions,\nJudgments or Estimates, or the\nApplication of Certain\nAccounting Principles, Could\nResult in Significant Losses\nor Other Adverse Impacts.\n\nU.S. GAAP requires Citi to use\ncertain assumptions, judgments\nand estimates in preparing its\nfinancial statements,\nincluding, among other items,\nthe estimate of the ACL;\nreserves related to\nlitigation, regulatory and tax\nmatters; valuation of DTAs;\nthe fair values of certain\nassets and liabilities; and\nthe assessment of goodwill and\nother assets for\n                               58                               \nimpairment. These assumptions,\njudgments and estimates are\ninherently limited because\nthey involve techniques, which\ncould include the use of\nhistorical data and AI, that\ncannot anticipate or model\nevery economic and financial\noutcome in the markets in\nwhich Citi operates, nor can\nthey anticipate the specific\nimpact and timing of such\noutcomes. For example, many\nmodels used by Citi include\nassumptions about correlation\nor lack thereof among prices\nof various asset classes or\nother market indicators that\nmay not hold in times of\nmarket stress, limited\nliquidity or other unforeseen\ncircumstances.\n\nIf Citi\u2019s assumptions,\njudgments or estimates\nunderlying its financial\nstatements are incorrect or\ndiffer from actual or\nsubsequent events, Citi could\nexperience unexpected losses\nor other adverse impacts, some\nof which could be significant.\nCiti could also experience\ndeclines in its stock price,\nbe subject to legal and\nregulatory proceedings and\nincur fines and other losses.\nFor additional information on\nthe key areas for which\nassumptions and estimates are\nused in preparing Citi\u2019s\nfinancial statements, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below and Notes 1\nand 16.\n\nFor example, the CECL\nmethodology requires that Citi\nprovide reserves for a current\nestimate of lifetime expected\ncredit losses for its loan\nportfolios and other financial\nassets, as applicable, at the\ntime those assets are\noriginated or acquired. This\nestimate is adjusted each\nperiod for changes in expected\nlifetime credit losses. Citi\u2019s\nACL estimate is subject to\njudgments and depends upon its\nCECL models and assumptions;\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions, including, among\nother things, the U.S.\nunemployment rate and U.S.\ninflation-adjusted gross\ndomestic product (real GDP);\nand the credit indicators,\ncomposition and other\ncharacteristics of Citi\u2019s loan\nportfolios and other\napplicable financial assets.\nThese model assumptions and\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions will change over\ntime, resulting in variability\nin Citi\u2019s ACL and, thus,\nimpact its results of\noperations and financial\ncondition, as well as\nregulatory capital due to the\nCECL phase-in (see the capital\nreturn risk factor above). For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below\nand Notes 1 and 16.\n\nMoreover, Citi has incurred\nlosses related to its foreign\noperations that are reported\nin the CTA components of\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) . In accordance with\nU.S. GAAP, a sale, substantial\nliquidation or other\ndeconsolidation event of any\nforeign operations, such as\nthose related to Citi\u2019s\nremaining divestitures or\nlegacy businesses, would\nresult in reclassification of\nany foreign CTA component of\nAOCI related to that foreign\noperation, including related\nhedges and taxes, into Citi\u2019s\nearnings. For example, Citi\ncould incur a significant loss\non sale due to CTA losses\nrelated to any such\ndivestitures (see the capital\nrisk factor above and the\nemerging markets risk factor\nbelow). The majority of these\nlosses would be regulatory\ncapital neutral at the\ncompletion of the divestiture.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s accounting policy for\nforeign currency translation\nand its foreign CTA components\nof AOCI , see Notes 1 and 21.\n\nChanges to Financial\nAccounting and Reporting\nStandards or Interpretations\nCould Have a Material Impact\non How Citi Records and\nReports Its Financial\nCondition and Results of\nOperations.\n\nPeriodically, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board\n(FASB) issues financial\naccounting and reporting\nstandards that govern key\naspects of Citi\u2019s financial\nstatements or interpretations\nthereof when those standards\nbecome effective, including\nthose areas where Citi is\nrequired to make assumptions\nor estimates. Changes to\nfinancial accounting or\nreporting standards or\ninterpretations, whether\npromulgated or required by the\nFASB, the SEC, U.S. banking\nregulators or others, could\npresent operational challenges\nand could also require Citi to\nchange certain of the\nassumptions or estimates it\npreviously used in preparing\nits financial statements,\nwhich could negatively impact\nhow it records and reports its\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations\ngenerally and/or with respect\nto particular businesses. See\nNote 1 for additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\naccounting policies and\nchanges in accounting,\nincluding the expected impacts\non Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition.\n\nIf Citi\u2019s Risk Management and\nOther Processes, Strategies or\nModels Are Deficient or\nIneffective, Citi May Incur\nSignificant Losses and Its\nRegulatory Capital and Capital\nRatios Could Be Negatively\nImpacted.\n\nCiti utilizes a broad and\ndiversified set of risk\nmanagement and other processes\nand strategies, including the\nuse of models in analyzing and\nmonitoring the various risks\nCiti assumes in conducting its\nactivities. For example, Citi\nuses models across the Company\nas part of its comprehensive\nstress testing initiatives.\nCiti also relies on data to\naggregate, assess and manage\nvarious risk exposures.\nManagement of these risks and\nthe reliability of the data\nare made more challenging\nwithin a large, global\nfinancial institution, such as\nCiti, particularly due to\ncomplex, diverse and rapidly\nchanging financial markets and\nconditions in which Citi\noperates. Unexpected losses\ncan result from untimely,\ninaccurate or incomplete\nprocesses and data. In 2020\nCitigroup and Citibank entered\ninto Consent Orders with the\nFRB and OCC that require\nCitigroup and Citibank to make\nimprovements in various\naspects of enterprise-wide\nrisk management, compliance,\ndata quality management\nrelated to governance, and\ninternal controls (see the\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factor\nbelow).\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s risk\nmanagement and other\nprocesses, strategies and\nmodels are inherently limited\nbecause they involve\ntechniques, including the use\nof historical data in many\ncircumstances, assumptions and\njudgments that cannot\nanticipate every economic and\nfinancial outcome in the\nmarkets in which Citi\noperates, particularly given\nvarious macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nchallenges and uncertainties\n(see the macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties\nrisk factor above), nor can\nthey anticipate the specifics\nand timing of such outcomes.\nFor example, many models used\nby Citi include assumptions\nabout correlation or lack\nthereof among prices of\nvarious asset classes or other\nmarket indicators that may not\nnecessarily hold in times of\nmarket stress, limited\nliquidity or other unforeseen\n                               59                               \ncircumstances, or identify\nchanges in markets or client\nbehaviors not yet inherent in\nhistorical data.\n\nCiti could incur significant\nlosses, receive negative\nregulatory evaluation or\nexamination findings or be\nsubject to additional\nenforcement actions, and its\nregulatory capital, capital\nratios and ability to return\ncapital could be negatively\nimpacted, if Citi\u2019s risk\nmanagement and other\nprocesses, including its\nability to manage and\naggregate data in a timely and\naccurate manner, strategies or\nmodels are deficient or\nineffective. For additional\ninformation, see the capital\nreturn risk factor above and\nthe heightened regulatory\nscrutiny and ongoing\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges risk factor below.\nSuch deficiencies or\nineffectiveness could also\nresult in inaccurate\nfinancial, regulatory or risk\nreporting.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s Basel III\nregulatory capital models,\nincluding its credit, market\nand operational risk models,\ncurrently remain subject to\nongoing regulatory review and\napproval, which may result in\nrefinements, modifications or\nenhancements (required or\notherwise) to these models.\nCiti is required to notify and\nobtain preapproval from both\nthe OCC and FRB prior to\nimplementing certain risk-\nweighted asset treatments, as\nwell as certain model changes,\nresulting in a more\nchallenging environment within\nwhich Citi must operate in\nmanaging its risk-weighted\nassets. Modifications or\nrequirements resulting from\nthese ongoing reviews, as well\nas any future changes or\nguidance provided by the U.S.\nbanking regulators regarding\nthe U.S. regulatory capital\nframework applicable to Citi,\nincluding, but not limited to,\npotential revisions to the\nU.S. Basel III rules (see the\ncapital return risk factor and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards and\nDevelopments\u201d above), have\nresulted, and could continue\nto result, in significant\nchanges to Citi\u2019s risk-\nweighted assets. These changes\ncan negatively impact Citi\u2019s\ncapital ratios and its ability\nto meet its regulatory capital\nrequirements.\n                                                                \n  CREDIT RISKS                                                  \n                                                                \nCredit Risk and Concentrations\nof Risk Can Increase the\nPotential for Citi to Incur\nSignificant Losses.\n\nCiti has credit exposures to\nconsumer, corporate and public\nsector borrowers and other\ncounterparties in the U.S. and\nvarious countries and\njurisdictions globally,\nincluding end-of-period\nconsumer loans of $393 billion\nand end-of-period corporate\nloans of $301 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s corporate and consumer\nloan portfolios, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Corporate Credit\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d below.\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\ncredit and country risk, see\nalso each respective\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above and \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u201d below and\nNotes 15 and 16.\n\nA default by or a significant\ndowngrade in the credit\nratings of a borrower or other\ncounterparty, or a decline in\nthe credit quality or value of\nany underlying collateral,\nexposes Citi to credit risk.\nAdditionally, despite Citi\u2019s\ntarget client strategy,\nvarious macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical, market and other\nfactors, among other things,\ncan increase Citi\u2019s credit\nrisk and credit costs,\nparticularly for vulnerable\nsectors, industries or\ncountries (see the\nmacroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties and co-branding\nand private label credit card\nrisk factors above and the\nemerging markets risk factor\nbelow). For\n\nexample, a weakening of\neconomic conditions can\nadversely affect borrowers\u2019\nability to repay their\nobligations, as well as result\nin Citi being unable to\nliquidate the collateral it\nholds or forced to liquidate\nthe collateral at prices that\ndo not cover the full amount\nowed to Citi.\n\nCiti is also a member of\nvarious central clearing\ncounterparties and could incur\nfinancial losses as a result\nof defaults by other clearing\nmembers due to the\nrequirements of clearing\nmembers to share losses.\nAdditionally, due to the\ninterconnectedness among\nfinancial institutions,\nconcerns about the\ncreditworthiness of or\ndefaults by a financial\ninstitution could spread to\nother financial market\nparticipants and result in\nmarket-wide losses and\ndisruption. For example, the\nfailure of regional banks and\nother banking stresses in\nrecent years resulted in\nmarket volatility across the\nfinancial sector.\n\nWhile Citi provides reserves\nfor expected losses for its\ncredit exposures, as\napplicable, such reserves are\nsubject to judgments and\nestimates that could be\nincorrect or differ from\nactual future events. For\nadditional information, see\nthe incorrect assumptions or\nestimates risk factor above.\n\nConcentrations of risk to\nclients or counterparties\nengaged in the same or related\nindustries or doing business\nin a particular geography, or\nto a particular product or\nasset class, especially credit\nand market risks, can also\nincrease Citi\u2019s risk of\nsignificant losses. For\nexample, Citi routinely\nexecutes a high volume of\nsecurities, trading,\nderivative and foreign\nexchange transactions with\nnon-U.S. sovereigns and with\ncounterparties in the\nfinancial services industry,\nincluding banks, insurance\ncompanies, investment banks,\ngovernments, central banks and\nother financial institutions.\nMoreover, Citi has\nindemnification obligations in\nconnection with various\ntransactions that expose it to\nconcentrations of risk,\nincluding credit risk from\nhedging or reinsurance\narrangements related to those\nobligations (see Note 28). A\nrapid deterioration of a large\nborrower or other counterparty\nor within a sector or country\nin which Citi has large\nexposures or indemnifications\nor unexpected market\ndislocations could lead to\nconcerns about the\ncreditworthiness of other\nborrowers or counterparties in\na certain geography and in\nrelated or dependent\nindustries, and such\nconditions could cause Citi to\nincur significant losses.\n                                                                \n  LIQUIDITY RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Businesses, Results of\nOperations and Financial\nCondition Could Be Negatively\nImpacted if It Does Not\nEffectively Manage Its\nLiquidity.\n\nAs a large, global financial\ninstitution, adequate\nliquidity and sources of\nfunding are essential to\nCiti\u2019s businesses. Citi\u2019s\nliquidity, sources of funding\nand costs of funding can be\nsignificantly and negatively\nimpacted by factors it cannot\ncontrol, such as general\ndisruptions in the financial\nmarkets; changes in fiscal and\nmonetary policies; regulatory\nrequirements, including\nchanges in regulations;\nnegative investor or\ncounterparty perceptions of\nCiti\u2019s creditworthiness;\ndeposit outflows or\nunfavorable changes in deposit\nmix; unexpected increases in\ncash or collateral\nrequirements; credit ratings;\nand the consequent inability\nto monetize available\nliquidity resources. In\naddition, Citi competes with\nother banks\n                               60                               \nand financial institutions for\nboth institutional and\nconsumer deposits, which\nrepresent Citi\u2019s most stable\nand lowest cost source of\nlong-term funding. The\ncompetition for deposits has\ncontinued to increase in\nrecent years, including as a\nresult of quantitative\ntightening by central banks\nand fixed income alternatives\nfor customer funds.\n\nCiti\u2019s costs to obtain and\naccess wholesale funding are\ndirectly related to changes in\ninterest and currency exchange\nrates and its credit spreads.\nChanges in Citi\u2019s credit\nspreads are driven by both\nexternal market factors and\nfactors specific to Citi, such\nas negative views by investors\nof the financial services\nindustry or Citi\u2019s financial\nprospects, and can be highly\nvolatile. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s primary\nsources of funding, see\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to obtain\nfunding may be impaired and\nits cost of funding could also\nincrease if other market\nparticipants are seeking to\naccess the markets at the same\ntime or to a greater extent\nthan expected, or if market\nappetite for corporate debt\nsecurities declines, as is\nlikely to occur in a liquidity\nstress event or other market\ncrisis. In such circumstances,\nCiti\u2019s ability to sell assets\nmay also be impaired if other\nmarket participants are\nseeking to sell similar assets\nat the same time or a liquid\nmarket does not exist for such\nassets. Additionally,\nunexpected changes in client\nneeds due to idiosyncratic\nevents or market conditions\ncould result in greater than\nexpected drawdowns from off-\nbalance sheet committed\nfacilities. A sudden drop in\nmarket liquidity could also\ncause a temporary or\nprotracted dislocation of\ncapital markets activity. In\naddition, clearing\norganizations, central banks,\nclients and financial\ninstitutions with which Citi\ninteracts may exercise the\nright to require additional\ncollateral during challenging\nmarket conditions, which could\nfurther impair Citi\u2019s\nliquidity. If Citi fails to\neffectively manage its\nliquidity, its businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition could be\nnegatively impacted.\n\nLimitations on the payments\nthat Citigroup Inc. receives\nfrom its subsidiaries could\nalso impact its liquidity. As\na holding company, Citigroup\nInc. relies on interest,\ndividends, distributions and\nother payments from its\nsubsidiaries to fund dividends\nas well as to satisfy its debt\nand other obligations. Several\nof Citi\u2019s U.S. and non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries are or may be\nsubject to capital adequacy or\nother liquidity, regulatory or\ncontractual restrictions on\ntheir ability to provide such\npayments, including any local\nregulatory stress test\nrequirements and inter-\naffiliate arrangements entered\ninto in connection with\nCitigroup Inc.\u2019s resolution\nplan. Citigroup Inc.\u2019s broker-\ndealer and bank subsidiaries\nare subject to restrictions on\ntheir ability to lend or\ntransact with affiliates, as\nwell as restrictions on their\nability to use funds deposited\nwith them in brokerage or bank\naccounts to fund their\nbusinesses.\n\nA bank holding company is also\nrequired by law to act as a\nsource of financial and\nmanagerial strength for its\nsubsidiary banks. As a result,\nthe FRB may require Citigroup\nInc. to commit resources to\nits subsidiary banks even if\ndoing so is not otherwise in\nthe interests of Citigroup\nInc. or its shareholders or\ncreditors, reducing the amount\nof funds available to meet its\nobligations.\n\nA Ratings Downgrade Could\nAdversely Impact Citi\u2019s\nFunding and Liquidity.\n\nThe credit rating agencies,\nsuch as Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s\nRatings and S&P Global\nRatings, continuously evaluate\nCiti and certain of its\nsubsidiaries. Their ratings of\nCiti and its rated\nsubsidiaries\u2019 long-term debt\nand short-term obligations are\nbased on firm-specific\nfactors, including the\nfinancial strength of Citi and\nsuch subsidiaries, as well as\nfactors that are not entirely\nwithin the control of Citi and\nits subsidiaries, such as the\nagencies\u2019 proprietary rating\nmethodologies and assumptions,\npotential impact from negative\nactions on U.S. sovereign\nratings and conditions\naffecting the financial\nservices industry and markets\ngenerally.\n\nA ratings downgrade could\nresult from, among other\nfactors, delays or missteps in\nCiti\u2019s transformation efforts,\nincluding risk management and\ninternal controls\nimprovements, public\nstatements by Citi\u2019s\nmanagement or regulators,\noperational risk charges,\ncontrol failures, substantial\nfailure to meet cost targets,\ndeterioration in Citi\u2019s\nfunding structure or\nliquidity, declines in\nprofitability, significant\nincreases in risk appetite or\nmaterial reductions in\nregulatory capitalization\nlevels.\n\nCiti and its subsidiaries may\nnot be able to maintain their\ncurrent respective ratings and\noutlooks. Ratings downgrades\ncould negatively impact Citi\nand its rated subsidiaries\u2019\nability to access the capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds as well as increase\ncredit spreads and the costs\nof those funds. A ratings\ndowngrade could also have a\nnegative impact on Citi and\nits rated subsidiaries\u2019\nability to obtain funding and\nliquidity due to reduced\nfunding capacity and the\nimpact from derivative\ntriggers, which could require\nCiti and its rated\nsubsidiaries to meet cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements or permit\ncounterparties to terminate\ncertain contracts. In\naddition, a ratings downgrade\ncould have a negative impact\non other funding sources such\nas secured financing and other\nmargined transactions for\nwhich there may be no explicit\ntriggers.\n\nFurthermore, a credit ratings\ndowngrade could have impacts\nthat may not be currently\nknown to Citi or are not\npossible to quantify. Some of\nCiti\u2019s counterparties and\nclients could have ratings\nlimitations on their\npermissible counterparties, of\nwhich Citi may or may not be\naware. Certain of Citi\u2019s\ncorporate customers and\ntrading counterparties, among\nother clients, could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit the trading of certain\nmarket instruments, and limit\nor withdraw deposits placed\nwith Citi in response to\nratings downgrades. Changes in\ncustomer and counterparty\nbehavior could impact not only\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nbut also the results of\noperations of certain Citi\nbusinesses. For additional\ninformation on the potential\nimpact of a reduction in\nCiti\u2019s or Citibank\u2019s credit\nratings, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u2014Potential\nImpacts of Ratings Downgrades\u201d\nbelow.\n                               61                               \n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISKS                                              \n                                                                \nSignificantly Heightened\nRegulatory Expectations and\nScrutiny in the U.S. and\nGlobally and Ongoing\nInterpretation and\nImplementation of Regulatory\nand Legislative Requirements\nand Changes Have Increased\nCiti\u2019s Compliance, Regulatory\nand Other Risks and Costs.\n\nLarge financial institutions,\nsuch as Citi, face\nsignificantly heightened\nregulatory and supervisory\nexpectations and scrutiny in\nthe U.S. and globally,\nincluding with respect to,\namong other things,\ngovernance, infrastructure,\ndata and risk management\npractices and controls. These\nregulatory and supervisory\nexpectations extend to\nemployees and agents and also\ninclude, among other things,\nthose related to customer and\nclient protection, market\npractices, anti-money\nlaundering, increasingly\ncomplex sanctions and\ndisclosure regimes and various\nregulatory reporting\nrequirements.\n\nU.S. financial institutions\nalso face increased\nexpectations and scrutiny in\nthe wake of the failures of\nseveral regional banks and\nother banking stresses in\n2023. In addition, Citi is\ncontinually required to\ninterpret and implement\nextensive and frequently\nchanging regulatory and\nlegislative requirements in\nthe U.S. and other\njurisdictions in which it does\nbusiness, which may overlap or\nconflict across jurisdictions,\nresulting in substantial\ncompliance, regulatory and\nother risks and costs.\n\nA failure to comply with these\nexpectations and requirements,\neven if inadvertent, or\nresolve any identified\ndeficiencies in a timely and\nsufficiently satisfactory\nmanner to regulators, could\nresult in increased regulatory\noversight; material\nrestrictions, including, among\nothers, imposition of\nadditional capital buffers and\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions; enforcement\nproceedings; penalties; and\nfines (see the capital return\nrisk factor above and legal\nand regulatory proceedings\nrisk factor below).\n\nMoreover, over the past\nseveral years, Citi has been\nrequired to implement a large\nnumber of regulatory,\nsupervisory and legislative\nchanges, including new\nregulatory, supervisory or\nlegislative requirements or\nregimes, across its businesses\nand functions, and these\nchanges continue. The changes\nthemselves may be complex and\nsubject to interpretation, and\nresult in changes to Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses. In addition, the\nchanges require continued\nsubstantial technology and\nother investments. In some\ncases, Citi\u2019s implementation\nof a regulatory or legislative\nrequirement is occurring\nsimultaneously with changing\nor conflicting regulatory\nguidance from multiple\njurisdictions (including\nvarious U.S. states) and\nregulators, legal challenges\nor legislative action to\nmodify or repeal existing\nrules or enact new rules.\n\nExamples of regulatory or\nlegislative changes that have\nresulted in increased\ncompliance risks and costs\ninclude (i) the U.S.\nregulatory capital framework\nand requirements, which have\ncontinued to evolve (see the\ncapital return risk factor and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d above);\n(ii) various laws relating to\nthe limitation of cross-border\ndata movement and/or\ncollection and use of customer\ninformation, including data\nlocalization and protection\nand privacy laws, which also\ncan conflict with or increase\ncompliance complexity with\nrespect to other laws,\nincluding anti-money\nlaundering laws; and (iii) the\nEU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability\nReporting Directive, which may\noverlap but also diverge from\nclimate-related disclosure\n\nrequirements expected to come\ninto effect in other\njurisdictions.\n\nCiti Is Subject to Extensive\nLegal and Regulatory\nProceedings, Examinations,\nInvestigations, Consent Orders\nand Related Compliance Efforts\nand Other Inquiries That Could\nResult in Large Monetary\nPenalties, Supervisory or\nEnforcement Orders, Business\nRestrictions, Limitations on\nDividends, Changes to\nDirectors and/or Officers and\nCollateral Consequences\nArising from Such Outcomes.\n\nCiti\u2019s regulators have broad\npowers and discretion under\ntheir prudential and\nsupervisory authority, and\nhave pursued active inspection\nand investigatory oversight.\nAt any given time, Citi is a\nparty to a significant number\nof legal and regulatory\nproceedings and is subject to\nnumerous governmental and\nregulatory examinations.\nAdditionally, Citi remains\nsubject to governmental and\nregulatory investigations,\nconsent orders (see discussion\nbelow) and related compliance\nefforts, and other inquiries.\nCiti could also be subject to\nenforcement proceedings and\nnegative regulatory evaluation\nor examination findings not\nonly because of violations of\nlaws and regulations, but also\ndue to failures, as determined\nby its regulators, to have\nadequate policies and\nprocedures, or to remedy\ndeficiencies on a timely basis\n(see also the capital return\nand resolution plan risk\nfactors above). Citi could\nface further scrutiny and\nconsequences from regulators\nfor failing to timely resolve\nopen regulatory issues or\nhaving repeat regulatory\nissues.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\n2020 FRB Consent Order and the\n2020 OCC Consent Order require\nCitigroup and Citibank,\nrespectively, to implement\nextensive targeted action\nplans and submit quarterly\nprogress reports on a timely\nand sufficient basis detailing\nthe results and status of\nimprovements relating\nprincipally to various aspects\nof enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement, compliance, data\nquality management related to\ngovernance, and internal\ncontrols. These improvements\nwill result in continued\nsignificant investments by\nCiti during 2025 and beyond,\nas an essential part of Citi\u2019s\nbroader transformation efforts\nto enhance its risk, controls,\ndata and finance\ninfrastructure and compliance\n(see the transformation,\nsimplification and other\npriorities-related risk factor\nabove).\n\nAdditionally, on July 10,\n2024, the FRB entered into a\nCivil Money Penalty Consent\nOrder with Citigroup, and the\nOCC entered into a Civil Money\nPenalty Consent Order with\nCitibank. The OCC and Citibank\nalso entered into an Amendment\nto the OCC\u2019s 2020 Consent\nOrder (the Amendment). The FRB\nfound that Citigroup had\nongoing deficiencies related\nto its data quality management\nprogram and had inadequate\nmeasures for managing and\ncontrolling its data quality\nrisks. The OCC found that\nCitibank had failed to make\nsufficient and sustainable\nprogress toward achieving\ncompliance with its 2020\nConsent Order.\n\nThe Amendment requires\nCitibank to formalize a\nprocess to determine whether\nsufficient resources are being\nappropriately allocated toward\nachieving timely and\nsustainable compliance with\nthe OCC\u2019s 2020 Consent Order,\nincluding any requirements on\nwhich Citibank is not making\nsufficient and sustainable\nprogress (such process, the\nResource Review Plan). There\ncan be no assurance that the\nResource\n                               62                               \nReview Plan and other efforts\nby Citi to address the\ndeficiencies and resolve the\nOCC and FRB Consent Orders\nwill occur in a manner\nsatisfactory, in both timing\nand sufficiency, to the FRB\nand OCC. (For additional\ninformation, see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nMultiyear Transformation\u201d\nabove.)\n\nAlthough there are no\nrestrictions on Citi\u2019s ability\nto serve its clients, the OCC\nConsent Order requires\nCitibank to obtain prior\napproval of any significant\nnew acquisition, including any\nportfolio or business\nacquisition, excluding\nordinary course transactions.\n\nMoreover, the OCC Consent\nOrder provides that the OCC\nhas the right to assess future\ncivil money penalties or take\nother supervisory and/or\nenforcement actions. Such\nactions by the OCC could\ninclude imposing business\nrestrictions, including\npossible additional\nlimitations on the declaration\nor payment of dividends by\nCitibank and changes in\ndirectors and/or senior\nexecutive officers. More\ngenerally, the OCC and/or the\nFRB could again take\nenforcement or other actions\nif the regulatory agency\nbelieves that Citi has not met\nregulatory expectations\nregarding compliance with the\nconsent orders.\n\nThe global judicial,\nregulatory and political\nenvironment has generally been\nchallenging for large\nfinancial institutions, which\nhave been subject to increased\nregulatory scrutiny. The\ncomplexity of the federal and\nstate regulatory and\nenforcement regimes in the\nU.S., coupled with the global\nscope of Citi\u2019s operations,\nalso means that a single event\nor issue may give rise to a\nlarge number of overlapping\ninvestigations and regulatory\nproceedings, either by\nmultiple federal and state\nagencies and authorities in\nthe U.S. or by multiple\nregulators and other\ngovernmental entities in\nforeign jurisdictions, as well\nas multiple civil litigation\nclaims in multiple\njurisdictions. Violations of\nlaw by other financial\ninstitutions may also result\nin regulatory scrutiny of\nCiti. Responding to regulatory\ninquiries and proceedings can\nbe time consuming and costly,\nand divert management\nattention from Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses.\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators\nhave been increasingly focused\non the culture of financial\nservices firms, including\nCiti, as well as \u201cconduct\nrisk,\u201d a term used to describe\nthe risks associated with\nbehavior by employees and\nagents, including third\nparties, that could harm\nclients, customers, employees\nor the integrity of the\nmarkets, such as improperly\ncreating, selling, marketing\nor managing products and\nservices or improper incentive\ncompensation programs with\nrespect thereto, failures to\nsafeguard a party\u2019s personal\ninformation or failures to\nidentify and manage conflicts\nof interest.\n\nIn addition to the greater\nfocus on conduct risk, the\ngeneral heightened scrutiny\nand expectations from\nregulators could lead to\ninvestigations and other\ninquiries, as well as\nremediation requirements,\nregulatory restrictions,\nstructural changes, more\nregulatory or other\nenforcement proceedings, civil\nlitigation and higher\ncompliance and other risks and\ncosts. For additional\ninformation, see the capital\nreturn and heightened\nregulatory scrutiny and\nongoing interpretation of\nregulatory changes risk\nfactors above. Further, while\nCiti takes numerous steps to\nprevent and detect conduct by\nemployees and agents that\ncould potentially harm\nclients, customers, employees\nor the integrity of the\nmarkets, such behavior may not\nalways be deterred or\nprevented.\n\nMoreover, the severity of the\nremedies sought in legal and\nregulatory proceedings to\nwhich Citi is subject has\nremained elevated. For\nexample, U.S. and certain\nnon-U.S. governmental entities\nhave increasingly brought\ncriminal actions against, or\nhave sought and obtained\ncriminal guilty pleas or\ndeferred prosecution\nagreements from, financial\ninstitutions and individual\nemployees. These types of\nactions by U.S. and other\ngovernments may, in the\nfuture, have significant\ncollateral consequences for\nCiti, including loss of\ncustomers and business,\noperational loss and the\ninability to offer certain\nproducts or services and/or\noperate certain businesses.\nCiti may be required to accept\nor be subject to similar types\nof criminal remedies, consent\norders, sanctions, substantial\nfines and penalties,\nremediation and other\nfinancial costs or other\nrequirements in the future,\nincluding for matters or\npractices not yet known to\nCiti, any of which could\nmaterially and negatively\naffect Citi\u2019s businesses,\nbusiness practices, financial\ncondition or results of\noperations, require material\nchanges in Citi\u2019s operations\nor cause Citi substantial\nreputational harm.\n\nAdditionally, many large\nclaims\u2014both private civil and\nregulatory\u2014asserted against\nCiti are highly complex, slow\nto develop and may involve\nnovel or untested legal\ntheories. The outcome of such\nproceedings is difficult to\npredict or estimate until late\nin the proceedings. Although\nCiti establishes accruals for\nits legal and regulatory\nmatters according to\naccounting requirements,\nCiti\u2019s estimates of, and\nchanges to, these accruals\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty, and\nthe amount of loss ultimately\nincurred in relation to those\nmatters may be substantially\nhigher than the amounts\naccrued (see the incorrect\nassumptions or estimates risk\nfactor above). In addition,\ncertain settlements are\nsubject to court approval and\nmay not be approved.\nFurthermore, regulators may be\nmore likely to pursue\ninvestigations or proceedings\nagainst financial\ninstitutions, such as Citi,\nthat have previously been the\nsubject of other regulatory\nactions.\n\nFor further information on\nCiti\u2019s legal and regulatory\nproceedings, see Note 30.\n                                                                \n  OTHER RISKS                                                   \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Emerging Markets\nPresence Subjects It to\nVarious Risks as well as\nIncreased Compliance and\nRegulatory Risks and Costs.\n\nCiti\u2019s presence in the\nemerging markets subjects it\nto various risks. During 2024,\nemerging markets revenues\naccounted for approximately\n28% of Citi\u2019s total revenues\n(based, beginning in 2024, on\nthe IMF and FFIEC\nclassifications, which\nresulted in the exclusion of\ncertain countries that Citi\npreviously classified as\nemerging markets).\n\nEmerging market risks include,\namong others, limitations or\nunavailability of hedges on\nforeign investments; foreign\ncurrency volatility, including\ndevaluations and strength in\nthe U.S. dollar; central bank\ninterest rate and other\nmonetary policies, including\nthe impact of sustained high\ninterest rates in the U.S.;\nunemployment, recessions or\nweak or slowing economic\ngrowth; elevated inflation and\nhyperinflation; foreign\nexchange controls, including\nan inability to access\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms; macroeconomic,\n                               63                               \ngeopolitical and domestic\npolitical challenges,\nuncertainties and volatility,\nincluding with respect to\nChina, the Russia\u2013Ukraine war\nand conflicts in the Middle\nEast; cyberattacks;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory laws and\nregulations; sanctions or\nasset freezes; sovereign debt\nvolatility; fluctuations in\ncommodity prices; the effects\nof potential policy and other\nchanges resulting from the new\nU.S. administration, including\nthose related to Mexico; the\neffects of potential policy\nand other changes resulting\nfrom the new Mexican\nadministration and Congress,\nincluding judicial reforms;\nregulatory changes, including\npotential conflicts among\nregulations with other\njurisdictions where Citi does\nbusiness; limitations on\nforeign investment;\nsociopolitical instability;\ncivil unrest; crime,\ncorruption and fraud;\nnationalization or loss of\nlicenses; potential criminal\ncharges; closure of branches\nor subsidiaries; and\nconfiscation of assets; and\nthese risks can be exacerbated\nin the event of a\ndeterioration in the\nrelationship between the U.S.\nand an emerging market\ncountry.\n\nFor example, Citi operates in\nseveral countries that have,\nor have had in the past,\nstrict capital controls,\ncurrency controls and/or\nsanctions, such as Argentina\nand Russia, that limit its\nability to convert local\ncurrency into U.S. dollars\nand/or transfer funds outside\nof those countries. For\ninstance, Citi may need to\nrecord additional translation\nlosses due to currency\ncontrols in Argentina (see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nbelow). Moreover, Citi may\nneed to record additional\nreserves for expected losses\nfor its credit exposures based\non the transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S., driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law (see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Russia\u201d and \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below).\n\nIn the event of a loss of\ncontrol of AO Citibank in\nRussia, Citi would be required\nto (i) write off its remaining\nnominal net investment, (ii)\nrecognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and (iii)\nrecognize a loss of $0.9\nbillion on intercompany\nliabilities owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities outside of Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve.

Three of\nthese targets (auto\nmanufacturing, energy and\npower) include facilitated\nemissions from capital markets\nactivities as well.\n\n\u2022 In 2024, Citi completed the\ninitial assessments in the\nauto manufacturing and steel\nsectors, to complement those\nin the energy and power\nsectors concluded in 2023, to\nbetter understand their\nstrategies and approach to the\nclimate transition.\n\nCiti recognizes that energy\ntransition, energy security\nand economic growth are not\nmutually exclusive and must be\naddressed simultaneously. Citi\nworks on executing its climate\ncommitments and supports its\nclients in financing their\ntransition to low-carbon\nbusiness models, while also\nworking with clients to\nprioritize global energy\nsecurity, including for\nemerging markets where access\nto affordable energy is a top\nconcern.\n                                                                \n  Sustainable Operations                                        \n                                                                \nIn addition to the 2030 net\nzero GHG emissions commitment\nfor its own operations, Citi\nmeasures progress against\noperational footprint goals,\nwhich include efforts to\nreduce the environmental\nimpact of its facilities\nthrough reductions in\nemissions, energy usage, water\nconsumption and waste\ngeneration. In 2024, Citi made\nprogress toward these goals by\nincreasing on-site solar\ngeneration, promoting\ninitiatives on waste diversion\nand recycling, and employing\nmore carbon-efficient\ntechniques for building\nrenovations.\n                                                                \n  Sustainable Finance                                           \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s $1 Trillion Sustainable\nFinance Goal, as previously\ndisclosed, is an integrated\neffort across the organization\nto finance and facilitate $1\ntrillion in environmental and\nsocial finance activities with\nproduct and service offerings\nacross multiple lines of\nbusiness.\n                                                                \n  Additional Information                                        \n                                                                \nThe \u201cCiti Climate Report,\u201d\nformerly the \u201cTask Force on\nClimate-Related Financial\nDisclosure (TCFD) Report,\u201d\nprovides additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\ncontinued progress to manage\nclimate risk and its Net Zero\nPlan, including information on\nfinanced and facilitated\nemissions and 2030 interim\nemissions reduction targets.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s environmental and\nsocial policies and\npriorities, click on \u201cOur\nImpact\u201d on Citi\u2019s website at\nwww.citigroup.com.

Citi has introduced market-based\nsalary structures and bonus opportunity guidelines in various\ncountries worldwide, and posts salary ranges on all external\nU.S. job postings, which aligns with strategic objectives of pay\nequity and transparency.\n\nIn addition, Citi has focused on measuring and addressing pay\nequity within the organization.\n\nCiti\u2019s annual pay equity analysis for 2024 determined that on an\nadjusted basis, global gender and U.S. racial pay gaps are in\neach case less than 1%. The adjusted pay gap is a true measure\nof pay equity, or \u201clike for like,\u201d that compares the\ncompensation of women to men and U.S. minorities to non-\nminorities when adjusting for factors such as job function,\ntitle/level and geography.\n                                                                \n  Benefits and Well-being                                       \n                                                                \nCiti is proud to provide a wide range of benefits that support\nits employees\u2019 mental, social, physical and financial well-being\nthrough various life stages and events.

of primary\nimportance to its overall\noperations. Accordingly, Citi\nhas established an Enterprise\nRisk Management (ERM)\nFramework to ensure that all\nof Citi\u2019s risks are managed\nappropriately and consistently\nacross the Company and at an\naggregate, enterprise-wide\nlevel. Citi\u2019s culture drives a\nstrong risk and control\nenvironment, and is at the\nheart of the ERM Framework,\nunderpinning the way Citi\nconducts business. The\nactivities that Citi engages\nin, and the risks those\nactivities generate, must be\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s Mission\nand Value Proposition (see\nbelow) and the key Leadership\nPrinciples that support it, as\nwell as Citi\u2019s risk appetite.\nAs discussed above, Citi also\ncontinues its efforts to\ncomply with the 2020 FRB and\nOCC Consent Orders and the\nOCC\u2019s 2024 Consent Order\nAmendment, relating\nprincipally to various aspects\nof risk management,\ncompliance, data quality\nmanagement related to\ngovernance, and internal\ncontrols (see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nMultiyear\n\nTransformation\u2014FRB and OCC\nConsent Orders\n\nCompliance\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d\nabove).\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition, which was\ndeveloped by its senior\nleadership and distributed\nthroughout the Company, Citi\nstrives to serve its clients\nas a trusted partner by\nresponsibly providing\nfinancial services that enable\ngrowth and economic progress\nwhile earning and maintaining\nthe public\u2019s trust by\nconstantly adhering to the\nhighest ethical standards. As\nsuch, Citi asks all employees\nto ensure that their decisions\npass three tests: they are in\nCiti\u2019s clients\u2019 best\ninterests, create economic\nvalue and are always\nsystemically responsible.\n\nAs discussed in \u201cHuman Capital\nResources and Management\u201d\nabove, Citi has designed\nLeadership Principles that\nrepresent the qualities,\nbehaviors and expectations all\nemployees must exhibit to\ndeliver on Citi\u2019s mission of\nenabling growth and economic\nprogress. The Leadership\nPrinciples inform Citi\u2019s ERM\nFramework and contribute to\ncreating a culture that drives\nclient, control and\noperational excellence. Citi\nemployees share a common\nresponsibility to uphold these\nLeadership Principles and hold\nthemselves to the highest\nstandards of ethics and\nprofessional behavior in\ndealing with Citi\u2019s clients,\nbusiness colleagues,\nshareholders, communities and\neach other.\n\nCiti\u2019s ERM Framework details\nthe principles used to support\neffective enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement across the end-to-\nend risk management lifecycle.\nThe ERM Framework covers the\nrisk management roles and\nresponsibilities of the\nCitigroup Board of Directors\n(the Board), Citi\u2019s Executive\nManagement Team (see \u201cRisk\nGovernance\u2014Executive\nManagement Team\u201d below) and\nemployees across the lines of\ndefense. The underlying\npillars of the framework\nencompass:\n\n\u2022 Culture \u2014the core principles\nand behaviors that underpin a\nstrong culture of risk\nawareness, in line with Citi\u2019s\nMission and Value Proposition,\nand Leadership Principles;\n\n\u2022 Governance \u2014the committee\nstructure and reporting\narrangements that support the\nappropriate oversight of risk\nmanagement activities at the\nBoard and Executive\n\nManagement Team levels and\nestablish Citi\u2019s Lines of\nDefense model;\n\n\u2022 Risk Management \u2014the end-to-\nend risk management cycle\nincluding the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting of\nall risks including top,\nmaterial, growing,\nidiosyncratic and emerging\nrisks, and aggregated to an\nenterprise-wide level; and\n\n\u2022 Enterprise Programs \u2014the key\nrisk management programs\nperformed across the risk\nmanagement lifecycle for all\nrisk categories.\n\nEach of these pillars is\nunderpinned by supporting\ncapabilities covering people,\ninfrastructure and tools that\nare in place to enable the\nexecution of the ERM\nFramework. Controls are\nestablished to mitigate the\nrisks associated with the\nexecution of these pillars and\nsupporting capabilities.\n\nCiti\u2019s approach to risk\nmanagement requires that its\nrisk-taking be consistent with\nits risk appetite. Risk\nappetite is the aggregate\nlevel of risk that Citi is\nwilling to tolerate in order\nto achieve its strategic\nobjectives and business plan.\nRisk limits and thresholds\nrepresent allocations of\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite to\nbusinesses and risk\ncategories. Concentration\nrisks are controlled through a\nsubset of these limits and\nthresholds.\n\nCiti\u2019s risks are generally\ncategorized and summarized as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Credit risk is the risk of\nloss resulting from the\ndecline in credit quality (or\ndowngrade risk) or failure of\na borrower, counterparty,\nthird party or issuer to honor\nits financial or contractual\nobligations.\n\n\u2022 Liquidity risk is the risk\nthat Citi will not be able to\nefficiently meet both expected\nand unexpected current and\nfuture cash flow and\ncollateral needs without\nadversely affecting either\ndaily operations or financial\nconditions of Citi. Risk may\nbe exacerbated by the\ninability of the Company to\naccess funding sources or\nmonetize assets and the\ncomposition of liability\nfunding and liquid assets.\n\n\u2022 Market risk ( trading and\nnon-trading ): Market risk of\ntrading portfolios is the risk\nof economic or trading loss\narising from changes in the\nvalue of Citi\u2019s assets and\nliabilities resulting from\nchanges in market variables,\nsuch as interest rates, equity\nand commodity prices, foreign\nexchange rates or credit\nspreads. Market risk of non-\ntrading portfolios is the\nimpact of adverse changes in\nmarket variables such as\ninterest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, credit spreads\nand equity prices on Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income, economic\nvalue of equity or AOCI .\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems,\nor from external events. It\nincludes legal risk, which is\nthe risk of loss (including\nlitigation costs, settlements\nand regulatory fines)\nresulting from Citi\u2019s failure\nto comply with laws,\nregulations, prudent ethical\nstandards or contractual\nobligations in any aspect of\nCiti\u2019s business, but excludes\nstrategic and reputation risks\n(see below).\n\n\u2022 Compliance risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial condition and\nresilience arising from\nviolations of laws, rules or\nregulations, or from non-\nconformance\n                               68                               \nwith prescribed practices,\ninternal policies and\nprocedures or ethical\nstandards.\n\n\u2022 Reputation risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial conditions and\nresilience from negative\nopinion held by stakeholders.\nThis risk may impair Citi\u2019s\ncompetitiveness by affecting\nits ability to establish new\nrelationships or services or\ncontinue servicing existing\nrelationships.\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk\nof a sustained impact (not\nepisodic impact) to Citi\u2019s\ncore strategic objectives as\nmeasured by impacts on\nanticipated earnings, market\ncapitalization or capital,\narising from the external\nfactors affecting the\nCompany\u2019s operating\nenvironment, as well as the\nrisks associated with defining\nthe strategy and executing the\nstrategy, which are\nidentified, measured and\nmanaged as part of the\nStrategic Risk Framework at\nthe Enterprise Level.\n\nAdditionally, Citi categorizes\nand summarizes risks that span\nthe above risk categories,\nsuch as concentration risk,\ncountry risk and climate risk.\n\nCiti uses a lines of defense\nmodel as a key component of\nits ERM Framework to manage\nits risks. As discussed below,\nthe lines of defense model\nbrings together risk-taking,\nrisk oversight and risk\nassurance under one umbrella\nand provides an avenue for\nrisk accountability of the\nfirst line of defense, a\nconstruct for effective\nchallenge by the second line\nof defense (Independent Risk\nManagement and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management),\nand empowers independent risk\nassurance by the third line of\ndefense (Internal Audit). In\naddition, the lines of defense\nmodel includes organizational\nunits tasked with supporting a\nstrong control environment\n(enterprise support\nfunctions). The first, second\nand third lines of defense,\nalong with enterprise support\nfunctions, have distinct roles\nand responsibilities and are\nempowered to perform relevant\nrisk management processes and\nresponsibilities in order to\nmanage Citi\u2019s risks in a\nconsistent and effective\nmanner.\n\nFirst Line of Defense: Front\nLine Units and Front Line Unit\nActivities\n\nCiti\u2019s first line of defense\nowns the risks and associated\ncontrols inherent in, or\narising from, the execution of\nits business activities and is\nresponsible for identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting\nthose risks consistent with\nCiti\u2019s strategy, Mission and\nValue Proposition, Leadership\nPrinciples and risk appetite.\n\nFront line units are\nresponsible and held\naccountable for managing the\nrisks associated with their\nactivities within the\nboundaries set by independent\nrisk management. They are also\nresponsible for designing and\nimplementing effective\ninternal controls and\nmaintaining processes for\nmanaging their risk profile,\nincluding through risk\nmitigation, so that it remains\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\nestablished risk appetite.\n\nFront line unit activities are\nconsidered part of the first\nline of defense and are\nsubject to the oversight and\nchallenge of independent risk\nmanagement.\n\nThe first line of defense is\ncomposed of Citi\u2019s operating\nsegments (i.e., Services ,\nMarkets , Banking , Wealth ,\nU.S. Personal Banking ), as\nwell as International, North\nAmerica and All Other\n(including certain corporate\nfunctions (i.e., Chief\nOperating Office, Enterprise\nServices and Public\n\nAffairs, Finance, Technology\nand Business Enablement). In\naddition, the first line of\ndefense includes the front\nline unit activities of other\norganizational units. Front\nline units may also include\nlower-level enterprise support\nfunctions and/or conduct\nenterprise support\nactivities\u2014see \u201cEnterprise\nSupport Functions\u201d below.\n\nSecond Line of Defense:\nIndependent Risk Management\nIndependent risk management\nunits are independent of the\nfirst line of defense. They\nare responsible for overseeing\nthe risk-taking activities of\nthe first line of defense and\nchallenging the first line of\ndefense in the execution of\nits risk management\nresponsibilities. They are\nalso responsible for\nindependently identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting\naggregate risks and for\nsetting standards for the\nmanagement and oversight of\nrisk. Independent risk\nmanagement is composed of\nIndependent Risk Management\n(IRM) and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management\n(ICRM), which are led by the\nGroup Chief Risk Officer (CRO)\nand Group Chief Compliance\nOfficer (CCO) who have\nunrestricted access to the\nBoard and its Risk Management\nCommittee to facilitate the\nability to execute their\nspecific responsibilities\npertaining to escalation to\nthe Board.\n                                                                \n  Independent Risk Management                                   \n                                                                \nThe IRM organization sets risk\nand control standards for the\nfirst line of defense and\nactively manages and oversees\naggregate credit, market\n(trading and non-trading),\nliquidity, strategic,\noperational and reputation\nrisks across Citi, including\nrisks that span categories,\nsuch as concentration risk,\ncountry risk and climate risk.\n\nIRM is organized to align to\nbusinesses, risk categories,\nlegal entities/clusters and\nCompany-wide, cross-risk\nfunctions or processes. Each\nof these units reports to a\nmember of the Risk Management\nExecutive Council, who all\nreport to the Citigroup CRO.\n                                                                \n  Independent Compliance Risk Management                        \n                                                                \nThe ICRM organization actively\noversees compliance risk\nacross Citi, sets compliance\nstandards for the first line\nof defense to manage\ncompliance risk and promotes\nbusiness conduct and activity\nthat is consistent with Citi\u2019s\nMission and Value Proposition\nand the compliance risk\nappetite. Citi\u2019s objective is\nto embed an enterprise-wide\ncompliance risk management\nframework and culture that\nidentifies, measures,\nmonitors, controls and\nescalates compliance risk\nacross Citi.\n\nICRM is aligned by business,\nfunction and geography to\nprovide compliance risk\nmanagement advice and credible\nchallenge on day-to-day\nmatters and strategic\ndecision-making for key\ninitiatives. ICRM also has\nprogram-level Enterprise\nCompliance units responsible\nfor setting standards and\nestablishing priorities for\nprogram-related compliance\nefforts. The CCO reports to\nCiti\u2019s Chief Legal Officer and\nICRM is organizationally part\nof the Global Legal Affairs &\nCompliance group. In addition,\nthe CCO has matrix reporting\ninto the CRO and is part of\nthe Risk Management Executive\nCouncil.\n                               69                               \n                                                                \n  Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit                         \n                                                                \nInternal Audit is independent\nof the first line, second line\nand enterprise support\nfunctions. The role of\nInternal Audit is to provide\nindependent, objective,\nreliable, valued and timely\nassurance to the Board, its\nAudit Committee, Citi senior\nmanagement and regulators over\nthe effectiveness of\ngovernance, risk management\nand controls that mitigate\ncurrent and evolving risks and\nenhance the control culture\nwithin Citi. The Citi Chief\nAuditor manages Internal Audit\nand reports functionally to\nthe Chair of the Citi Audit\nCommittee and administratively\nto Citi\u2019s CEO. The Citi Chief\nAuditor has unrestricted\naccess to the Board and the\nBoard Audit Committee to\naddress risks and issues\nidentified through Internal\nAudit\u2019s activities.\n                                                                \n  Enterprise Support Functions                                  \n                                                                \nEnterprise support functions\nengage in activities that\nsupport safety and soundness\nacross Citi. These functions\nprovide advisory services\nand/or design, implement,\nmaintain and oversee Company-\nwide programs that support\nCiti in maintaining an\neffective control environment.\n\nEnterprise support functions\nare composed of Human\nResources and Global Legal\nAffairs and Compliance\n(exclusive of ICRM, which is\npart of the second line of\ndefense). Front line units may\nalso include enterprise\nsupport units and/or conduct\nenterprise support activities\n(e.g., the Controllers Group\nwithin Finance).\n\nEnterprise support functions,\nunits and activities are\nsubject to the relevant\nCompany-wide independent\noversight processes specific\nto the risks for which they\nare accountable (e.g.,\noperational risk, compliance\nrisk, reputation risk).\n                                                                \n  Risk Governance                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ERM Framework\nencompasses risk management\nprocesses to address risks\nundertaken by Citi through\nidentification, measurement,\nmonitoring, controlling and\nreporting of all risks.

For example,\ncredit risk can arise from a\ndeterioration in (i) the\noperating and financial\nperformance of a borrower or\n(ii) a decline in the quality\nor value of any underlying\ncollateral, both of which may\nalso be impacted by adverse\nchanges in macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical, market and other\nfactors. Credit risk is one of\nthe most significant risks\nCiti faces as an institution\n(see \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Credit\nRisks\u201d above). Credit risk\narises in many of Citigroup\u2019s\nbusiness activities,\nincluding: \u2022 consumer,\ncommercial and corporate\nlending; \u2022 capital markets\nderivative transactions; \u2022\nstructured finance; and \u2022\nsecurities financing\ntransactions (repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nand securities loaned and\nborrowed). Credit risk also\narises from clearing and\nsettlement activities, when\nCiti transfers an asset in\nadvance of receiving its\ncounter-value or advances\nfunds to settle a transaction\non behalf of a client.\nConcentration risk, within\ncredit risk, is the risk\nassociated with having credit\nexposure concentrated within a\nspecific client, industry,\nregion or other category. Citi\nhas an established framework\nin place for managing credit\nrisk across all businesses\nthat includes a defined risk\nappetite, credit limits and\ncredit policies. Citi\u2019s credit\nrisk management framework also\nincludes policies and\nprocedures to manage problem\nexposures. To manage\nconcentration risk, Citi has\nin place a framework\nconsisting of industry limits,\nsingle-name concentrations for\neach business and across\nCitigroup and a specialized\nproduct limit framework.\nCredit exposures are generally\nreported in notional terms for\naccrual loans, reflecting the\nvalue at which the loans as\nwell as other off-balance\nsheet commitments are carried\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit exposure arising\nfrom capital markets\nactivities is generally\nexpressed as the current mark-\nto-market, net of margin,\nreflecting the net value owed\nto Citi by a given\ncounterparty. Citi\u2019s loans are\nreported in two categories:\ncorporate and consumer. These\ncategories are classified\nprimarily according to the\noperating segment, reporting\nunit and component that manage\nthe loans in addition to the\nnature of the obligor, with\ncorporate loans generally made\nfor corporate institutional\nand public sector clients\naround the world and consumer\nloans to retail and small\nbusiness customers. The credit\nrisk associated with Citi\u2019s\ncredit exposures is a function\nof the idiosyncratic\ncreditworthiness of the\nobligor, as well as the terms\nand conditions of the specific\nobligation. Citi assesses the\ncredit risk associated with\nits credit exposures on a\nregular basis through its\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL) process (see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d below and Notes 1\n\nand 16), as well as through\nregular stress testing at the\ncompany, business, geography\nand product levels. These\nstress-testing processes\ntypically estimate potential\nincremental credit costs that\nwould occur as a result of\neither downgrades in the\ncredit quality or defaults of\nthe obligors or\ncounterparties.

Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citi believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of December 31,\n2024. Citi has applied\nmanagement judgment to adjust\ninternal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been observed. As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

The\nportfolio is generally\ndelinquency managed, where\nCiti evaluates credit risk\nbased on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 15. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe fourth quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nBanking increased quarter-\nover- quarter and year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by\nconsumer overdraft loans. The\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate was largely unchanged\nquarter-over-quarter and\ndecreased year-over-year. The\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby lower delinquencies in\nconsumer mortgages.\n          \n  Wealth  \n          \nWealth provides consumer\nmortgages, margin lending,\ncredit cards and other lending\nproducts to customer segments\nthat range from affluent to\nultra-high net worth through\nthe Private Bank, Wealth at\nWork and Citigold businesses.\nThese customer segments\nrepresent a target market that\nis characterized by\nhistorically low default rates\nand delinquencies and includes\nloans that are delinquency\nmanaged or classifiably\nmanaged. The delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio consists\nprimarily of mortgages, margin\nlending and credit cards.\n                               81                               \nAs of December 31, 2024,\napproximately $43 billion, or\n29%, of the portfolios were\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of\nmortgage loans, margin loans,\npersonal and small business\nloans and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit risk\nbased on their internal risk\nrating, of which 72% were\nrated investment grade. While\nthe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rates shown in the\nchart above were calculated\nonly for the delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio, the net\ncredit loss rates presented\nwere calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe fourth quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate in Wealth was\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year.\nThe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate increased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nconsumer mortgages. The low\nnet credit loss and the 90+\ndays past due delinquency\nrates continued to reflect the\nstrong credit profiles of the\nportfolios.\n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Banamex and\nprovides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nMexico Consumer serves a mass-\nmarket segment in Mexico and\nfocuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As of December\n31, 2024, approximately 40% of\nMexico Consumer EOP loans\nconsisted of credit card\nloans, which generally drives\nthe overall credit performance\nof Mexico Consumer, as the\ncards net credit losses\nrepresented approximately 60%\nof total Mexico Consumer net\ncredit losses for the fourth\nquarter of 2024. As presented\nin the chart above, the fourth\nquarter of 2024 net credit\nloss rate and the 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate in\nMexico Consumer increased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nthe ongoing normalization of\nloss and delinquency rates\nfrom post-pandemic lows.

As of December\n31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 72%, 85% and 96% of Wealth classifiably\nmanaged loans were rated investment grade. For additional\ninformation on the credit quality of the Wealth portfolio,\nincluding classifiably managed portfolios, see \u201cConsumer Credit\nTrends\u201d above.\n\n(5) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios for Retail Banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss\npredominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored\nagencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $69 million ($0.5 billion), $63 million ($0.5\nbillion) and $89 million ($0.6 billion) at December 31, 2024,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans\n30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans have the\nsame adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $66\nmillion, $73 million and $70 million at December 31, 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the\nguaranteed loans.\n\n(6) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail\nServices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and\nRussia for all periods presented.\n\n(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nConsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and, hence, the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nmost recent reclassifications commenced as follows: Taiwan and\nIndonesia in the first quarter of 2022; Taiwan closed in the\nthird quarter of 2023 and Indonesia closed in the fourth quarter\nof 2023.

Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nTDRs and Vintage Disclosures . The ASU eliminated the accounting\nand disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement\nto measure the ACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF)\napproach. On January 1, 2023, Citi recorded a $352 million\ndecrease in the Allowance for loan losses , along with a $290\nmillion after-tax increase to Retained earnings . See Note 1.\n\n(2) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(CECL) . The ASC introduces a new credit loss methodology\nrequiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also\nproviding additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1,\n2020, Citi recorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%,\npretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses , along with\na $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a\ndeferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due\nto longer estimated tenors than under the incurred loss\nmethodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries, and (ii) a\n$0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter\nremaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more\nspecific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies.\n\n(3) Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses,\nsuch as changes in the allowance from acquisitions,\ndispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase\naccounting adjustments, etc.\n\n(4) 2024 includes an approximate $300 million decrease related\nto FX translation, as well as an initial allowance for credit\nlosses on newly purchased credit-deteriorated assets during the\nyear.\n\n(5) 2023 includes an approximate $175 million increase related\nto FX translation.\n\n(6) 2022 includes an approximate $350 million reclass related to\nthe announced sales of Citi\u2019s consumer banking businesses in\nThailand, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Bahrain and\nVietnam. Also includes a decrease of approximately $100 million\nrelated to FX translation.\n\n(7) 2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to\nCiti\u2019s agreement to sell its Australia consumer banking business\nand an approximate $90 million reclass related to Citi\u2019s\nagreement to sell its Philippines consumer banking business.\nThose ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during 2021. 2021\nalso includes a decrease of approximately $134 million related\nto FX translation.\n\n(8) 2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related\nto the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios.\nIn addition, 2020 includes an increase of approximately $97\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(9) December 31, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 exclude $8.0\nbillion, $7.6 billion, $5.4 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.9\nbillion, respectively, of loans that are carried at fair value.\n\n(10) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(11) The ACLL represents management\u2019s estimate of expected\ncredit losses in the portfolio and troubled debt restructurings.\nSee \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\u201d\nbelow.

 \nThere is a certain amount of\noverlap among non-accrual\nloans and assets. The\nfollowing summary provides a\ngeneral description of each\ncategory:\n\n\u2022 Corporate and consumer\n(including commercial banking)\nnon-accrual status is based on\nthe determination that payment\nof interest or principal is\ndoubtful.\n\n\u2022 A corporate loan may be\nclassified as non-accrual and\nstill be current on principal\nand interest payments under\nthe terms of the loan\nstructure.\n\n\u2022 Consumer non-accrual status\nis generally based on aging,\ni.e., the borrower has fallen\nbehind on payments.\n\n\u2022 Consumer mortgage loans,\nother than Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA)\u2013insured\nloans, are classified as non-\naccrual within 60 days of\nnotification that the borrower\nhas filed for bankruptcy.\nUninsured consumer mortgage\nloans are classified as non-\naccrual if the loan is 90 days\nor more past due. In addition,\nhome equity loans are\nclassified as non-accrual if\nthe related residential first\nmortgage loan is 90 days or\nmore past due.\n\n\u2022 U.S. Branded Cards and\nRetail Services are not\nincluded because, under\nindustry standards, credit\ncard loans accrue interest\nuntil such loans are charged\noff, which typically occurs at\n180 days of contractual\ndelinquency.\n                               91                               \n                                                                \n  Non-Accrual Loans                                             \n                                                                \nThe table below summarizes\nCitigroup\u2019s non-accrual loans\n(NAL) as of the periods\nindicated. Non-accrual loans\nmay still be current on\ninterest payments. In\nsituations where Citi\nreasonably expects that only a\nportion of the principal owed\nwill ultimately be collected,\nall payments received are\nreflected as a reduction of\nprincipal and not as interest\nincome. For all other non-\naccrual loans, cash interest\nreceipts are generally\nrecorded as revenue.\n                                                                \n  \u2026

Corporate non-accrual loans\nmay still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans.

Funding and\nliquidity risks arise from\nseveral factors, many of which\nare mostly or entirely outside\nof Citi\u2019s control, such as\ndisruptions in the financial\nmarkets, changes in key\nfunding sources, credit\nspreads, changes in Citi\u2019s\ncredit ratings and\nmacroeconomic, geopolitical\nand other conditions. For\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Liquidity Risks\u201d\nabove.\n\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nmanagement objectives are\naimed at (i) funding its\nexisting asset base, (ii)\ngrowing its core businesses,\n(iii) maintaining sufficient\nliquidity, structured\nappropriately, so that Citi\ncan operate under a variety of\nadverse circumstances,\nincluding potential Company-\nspecific and/or market\nliquidity events in varying\ndurations and severity, and\n(iv) satisfying regulatory\nrequirements, including, but\nnot limited to, those related\nto resolution planning (see\n\u201cResolution Plan\u201d and \u201cTotal\nLoss-Absorbing Capacity\n(TLAC)\u201d below). Citigroup\u2019s\nprimary liquidity objectives\nare established by entity, and\nin aggregate, across two major\ncategories:\n\n\u2022 Citibank (including Citibank\nEurope plc, Citibank Singapore\nLtd. and Citibank (Hong Kong)\nLtd.); and\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s non-bank and other\nentities, including the parent\nholding company (Citigroup\nInc.), Citi\u2019s primary\nintermediate holding company\n(Citicorp LLC), Citi\u2019s broker-\ndealer subsidiaries (including\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc.,\nCitigroup Global Markets\nLimited and Citigroup Global\nMarkets Japan Inc.) and other\nbank and non-bank subsidiaries\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup (including Banamex).\n\nAt an aggregate Citigroup\nlevel, Citi\u2019s goal is to\nmaintain sufficient funding in\namount and tenor to fully fund\ncustomer assets and to provide\nan appropriate amount of cash\nand high-quality liquid assets\n(as discussed below), even in\ntimes of stress, in order to\nmeet its payment obligations\nas they come due. The\nliquidity risk management\nframework provides that, in\naddition to the aggregate\nrequirements, certain entities\nbe self-sufficient or net\nproviders of liquidity,\nincluding in conditions\nestablished under their\ndesignated stress tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s primary funding sources\ninclude (i) corporate and\nconsumer deposits via Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries, including\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank),\n(ii) long-term debt (primarily\nsenior and subordinated debt)\nmainly issued by Citigroup\nInc., as the parent, and\nCitibank, and (iii)\nstockholders\u2019 equity. These\nsources may be supplemented by\nshort-term borrowings,\nprimarily in the form of\nsecured funding transactions.\n\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nframework, working in concert\nwith overall asset/liability\nmanagement, helps ensure that\nthere is sufficient liquidity\nand tenor in the overall\nliability structure (including\nfunding products) of the\nCompany relative to the\nliquidity requirements of\nCiti\u2019s assets. This reduces\nthe risk that liabilities will\nbecome due before assets\nmature or are\n\nmonetized. The Company holds\nexcess liquidity, primarily in\nthe form of high-quality\nliquid assets (HQLA), as\npresented in the table below.\n\nCiti\u2019s liquidity is managed\ncentrally by Corporate\nTreasury, reported within\nCorporate/Other in All Other ,\nin conjunction with regional\nand in-country treasurers with\noversight provided by\nIndependent Risk Management\nand various Asset and\nLiability Committees (ALCOs)\nat the individual entity,\nregion, country and business\nlevels. Pursuant to this\napproach, Citi\u2019s HQLA are\nmanaged with emphasis on\nasset/liability management and\nentity-level liquidity\nadequacy throughout Citi.\n\nCiti\u2019s CRO and CFO co-chair\nCitigroup\u2019s ALCO, which\nincludes Citi\u2019s Treasurer and\nother senior executives. The\nALCO sets the strategy of the\nliquidity portfolio and\nmonitors portfolio performance\n(see \u201cRisk Governance\u2014Board\nand Executive Management\nCommittees\u201d above).\nSignificant changes to\nportfolio asset allocations\nare approved by the ALCO.

These scenarios\ninclude assumptions about\nsignificant changes in key\nfunding sources, market\ntriggers (such as credit\nratings), potential uses of\nfunding and macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nconditions. These conditions\ninclude expected and stressed\nmarket conditions as well as\nCompany-specific events.\n\nLiquidity stress tests are\nperformed to ascertain\npotential mismatches between\nliquidity sources and uses\nover a variety of time\nhorizons and over different\nstressed conditions. To\nmonitor the liquidity of an\nentity, these stress tests and\npotential mismatches are\ncalculated on a daily basis.\n\nGiven the range of potential\nstresses, Citi maintains\ncontingency funding plans on a\nconsolidated basis and for\nindividual entities. These\nplans specify a wide range of\nreadily available actions for\na variety of adverse market\nconditions or idiosyncratic\nstresses.\n                               94                               \n                                                                \n  High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nNote: The amounts in the table\nabove are presented on an\naverage basis.

The table above\nincorporates various\nrestrictions that could limit\nthe transferability of\nliquidity between legal\nentities, including Section\n23A of the Federal Reserve\nAct. Changes in HQLA line\ncategories from the prior-year\nperiod were primarily driven\nby the reallocation of\nnontransferable HQLA, which\ndid not change total average\nHQLA, and thus did not impact\nCiti\u2019s LCR ratio.\n\n(1) Foreign government debt\nincludes securities issued or\nguaranteed by foreign\nsovereigns, agencies and\nmultilateral development\nbanks. Foreign government debt\nsecurities are held largely to\nsupport local liquidity\nrequirements and Citi\u2019s local\nfranchises and principally\ninclude government bonds from\nJapan, Korea, the United\nKingdom, Mexico and Hong Kong.\n\nThe table above includes\naverage amounts of HQLA held\nat Citigroup\u2019s operating\nentities that are eligible for\ninclusion in the calculation\nof Citigroup\u2019s consolidated\nLCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR\nrules. These amounts include\nthe HQLA needed to meet the\nminimum requirements at these\nentities as well as any\namounts in excess of these\nminimums that are available to\nbe transferred to other\nentities within Citigroup.\nCitigroup\u2019s average HQLA\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nas of the fourth quarter of\n2024, primarily driven by an\nincrease in average wholesale\nfunding. As of December 31,\n2024, Citigroup had\napproximately $933 billion of\navailable liquidity resources\nto support client and business\nneeds, including end-of-period\nHQLA ($554 billion);\nadditional unencumbered HQLA,\nincluding excess liquidity\nheld at bank entities that is\nnon-transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup\n($227 billion); and unused\nborrowing capacity from\navailable assets not already\naccounted for within Citi\u2019s\nHQLA to support additional\nadvances from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and the\nFederal Reserve Bank discount\nwindow ($152 billion).\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR. The LCR is calculated by\ndividing HQLA by estimated net\noutflows assuming a stressed\n30-day period, with the net\noutflows determined by\nstandardized stress outflow\nand inflow rates prescribed in\nthe LCR rule. The outflows are\npartially offset by\ncontractual inflows from\nassets maturing within 30\ndays. Similar to outflows, the\ninflows are calculated based\non prescribed factors to\nvarious asset categories, such\nas retail loans as well as\nunsecured and secured\nwholesale lending. The minimum\nLCR requirement is 100%.

In the\nfourth quarter of 2024,\naverage deposits for: \u2022\nServices increased 4% year-\nover-year, as TTS increased 3%\ndue to deepened client\nrelationships and growth in\noperational deposits, and\nSecurities Services increased\n11% driven by AUC growth. \u2022\nUSPB decreased 18% year-over-\nyear, as the transfer of\ncertain relationships and the\nassociated deposits to Wealth\nmore than offset underlying\ndeposit growth. \u2022 Wealth\nincreased 3% year-over-year,\nlargely reflecting the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits from USPB\n, partially offset by the\nshift in deposits to higher-\nyielding investments on Citi\u2019s\nplatform. \u2022 All Other\ndecreased 21% year-over-year,\nprimarily reflecting the\ncontinued wind-downs, the\nimpact of FX translation of\ndeposits in Legacy Franchises\nand reductions of corporate\ncertificates of deposit in\nCorporate/Other.\n                               96                               \nThe majority of Citi\u2019s $1.3\ntrillion of end-of-period\ndeposits are institutional\n(approximately $820 billion)\nand span approximately 90\ncountries. A large majority of\nthese institutional deposits\nare within TTS, and of these,\napproximately 80% are from\nclients that use all three TTS\nintegrated services: payments\nand collections, liquidity\nmanagement and working capital\nsolutions. In addition, nearly\n80% of TTS deposits are from\nclients that have a longer\nthan 15-year relationship with\nCiti. Citi also has a strong\nconsumer and wealth deposit\nbase, with $402 billion of\nUSPB and Wealth deposits as of\nyear end, which are\ndiversified across the Private\nBank, Citigold and Wealth at\nWork within Wealth , as well\nas USPB , and across regions\nand products. As of year end,\napproximately 66% of U.S.\nCitigold clients have been\nwith Citi for more than 10\nyears and approximately 39% of\nPrivate Bank ultra-high net\nworth clients have been with\nCiti for more than 10 years.\nIn addition, USPB \u2019s deposits\nare spread across six key\nmetropolitan areas in the U.S.\nLong-Term Debt Long-term debt\n(generally defined as debt\nwith original maturities of\none year or more) represents\nthe most significant component\nof Citi\u2019s funding for the\nCitigroup parent company and\nCiti\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries\nand is a supplementary source\nof funding for the bank\nentities.

For\nadditional information on\nrisks related to the\napplication of resolution plan\nrequirements, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nabove. Citigroup alternates\nbetween submitting a full\nresolution plan and a targeted\nresolution plan on a biennial\ncycle.\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s preferred \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d resolution\nplan strategy, only Citigroup,\nthe parent holding company,\nwould enter into bankruptcy,\nwhile Citigroup\u2019s material\nlegal entities (as defined in\nthe public section of its 2023\nresolution plan, which can be\nfound on the FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s\nwebsites) would remain\noperational outside of any\nresolution or insolvency\nproceedings. Citigroup\u2019s\nresolution plan has been\ndesigned to minimize the risk\nof systemic impact to the U.S.\nand global financial systems,\nwhile maximizing the value of\nthe bankruptcy estate for the\nbenefit of Citigroup\u2019s\ncreditors, including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders.\n\nIn addition, in line with the\nFRB\u2019s total loss-absorbing\ncapacity (TLAC) rule,\nCitigroup\u2019s shareholders and\nunsecured creditors\u2014including\nits unsecured long-term debt\nholders\u2014bear any losses\nresulting from Citigroup\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Accordingly, any\nvalue realized by holders of\nits unsecured long-term debt\nmay not be sufficient to repay\nthe amounts owed to such debt\nholders in the event of a\nbankruptcy or other resolution\nproceeding of Citigroup.\n\nThe FDIC has also indicated\nthat it was developing a\nsingle point of entry strategy\nto implement the Orderly\nLiquidation Authority under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, which provides the FDIC\nwith the ability to resolve a\nfirm when it is determined\nthat bankruptcy would have\nserious adverse effects on\nfinancial stability in the\nU.S.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in\nresponse to feedback received\nfrom the FRB and FDIC,\nCitigroup took the following\nactions:\n\n(i) Citicorp LLC (Citicorp),\nan existing wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Citigroup, was\nestablished as an intermediate\nholding company (an IHC) for\ncertain of Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities;\n\n(ii) Citigroup executed an\ninter-affiliate agreement with\nCiticorp, Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities and certain other\naffiliated entities pursuant\nto which Citicorp is required\nto provide liquidity and\ncapital support to Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities in the event that\nCitigroup were to enter\nbankruptcy proceedings (Citi\nSupport Agreement);\n\n(iii) pursuant to the Citi\nSupport Agreement:\n\n\u2022 Citigroup made an initial\ncontribution of assets,\nincluding certain high-quality\nliquid assets and inter-\naffiliate loans (Contributable\nAssets), to Citicorp, and\nCiticorp became the business-\nas-usual funding vehicle for\nCitigroup\u2019s operating material\nlegal entities;\n\n\u2022 Citigroup will be obligated\nto continue to transfer\nContributable Assets to\nCiticorp over time, subject to\ncertain amounts retained by\nCitigroup to, among other\nthings, meet Citigroup\u2019s near-\nterm cash needs;\n\n\u2022 in the event of a Citigroup\nbankruptcy, Citigroup will be\nrequired to contribute most of\nits remaining assets to\nCiticorp; and\n\n(iv) the obligations of both\nCitigroup and Citicorp under\nthe Citi Support Agreement, as\nwell as the Contributable\nAssets, are secured pursuant\nto a security agreement.\n                                                                \n  Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)                          \n                                                                \nU.S. GSIBs are required to\nmaintain minimum levels of\nTLAC and eligible LTD, each\nset by reference to the GSIB\u2019s\nconsolidated risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and total\nleverage exposure. The\nintended purpose of the\nrequirements is to facilitate\nthe orderly resolution of U.S.\nGSIBs under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code and Title II\nof the Dodd-Frank Act.

Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $255\nbillion as of December 31,\n2024 decreased 8% both year-\nover-year and sequentially,\nlargely driven by lower\nfinancing to support trading-\nrelated assets within Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries. As\nof the quarter ended December\n31, 2024, on an average basis,\nsecured funding was $318\nbillion. The portion of\nsecured funding in the broker-\ndealer subsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity and is primarily\nsecured by high-quality liquid\nsecurities such as U.S.\nTreasury securities, U.S.\nagency securities and foreign\ngovernment debt securities.\nOther \u201cmatched book\u201d activity\nis secured by less liquid\nsecurities, including equity\nsecurities, corporate bonds\nand asset-backed securities,\nthe tenor of which is\ngenerally equal to or longer\nthan the tenor of the\ncorresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $49 billion as of December\n31, 2024 increased 29% year-\nover-year, reflecting higher\ncommercial paper issuances at\nthe broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, as Citi\ncontinues to diversify its\nfunding profile, and increased\n17% sequentially, driven by\nthe commercial paper issuances\nand normal business activity\n(see Note 19 for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                              100                               \n                                                                \n  CREDIT RATINGS                                                \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, funding capacity,\nability to access capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds, the cost of these funds\nand its ability to maintain\ncertain deposits are partially\ndependent on its credit\nratings.\n\nThe table below presents the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of December 31,\n2024.

Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfinancing transactions and\nother margin requirements, for\nwhich there are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nIn total, as of December 31,\n2024, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank\nacross all three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$0.2 billion, compared to $0.2\nbillion as of September 30,\n2024. As detailed under \u201cHigh-\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d\nabove, Citigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings at certain Citibank\nsubsidiaries. Mitigating\nactions available to Citibank\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, selling or financing\nhighly liquid government\nsecurities, tailoring levels\nof secured lending, adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nassets, reducing loan\noriginations and renewals,\nraising additional deposits or\nborrowing from the FHLB or\ncentral banks. Citi believes\nthese mitigating actions could\nsubstantially reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above.\n                                                                \n  Citibank\u2014Additional Potential Impacts                         \n                                                                \nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of December 31,\n2024 , Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximate ly\n$14.9 billion t o consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits (compared to $11.0\nbillion at December 31, 2023)\n(see Note 23 ).\n                              101                               \nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nMarket risk is the potential\nfor losses arising from\nchanges in the value of Citi\u2019s\nassets and liabilities\nresulting from changes in\nmarket variables such as\ninterest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices,\ncommodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their\nimplied volatilities. Market\nrisk arises from both Citi\u2019s\ntrading and non-trading\nportfolios. For additional\ninformation on market risk and\nmarket risk management at\nCiti, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nabove.\n\nEach business is required to\nestablish, with approval from\nCiti\u2019s market risk management,\na market risk limit framework\nfor identified risk factors\nthat clearly defines approved\nrisk profiles and is within\nthe parameters of Citi\u2019s\noverall risk appetite. These\nlimits are monitored by the\nRisk organization, including\nvarious regional, legal entity\nand business Risk Management\ncommittees, Citi\u2019s country and\nbusiness Asset and Liability\nCommittees and the Citigroup\nRisk Management and Asset and\nLiability Committees. In all\ncases, the businesses are\nultimately responsible for the\nmarket risks taken and for\nremaining within their defined\nlimits.\n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS                         \n                                                                \nMarket risk from non-trading\nportfolios stems predominantly\nfrom the potential impact of\nchanges in interest rates and\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s net interest income and\non Citi\u2019s Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) from its investment\nsecurities portfolios. Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Banking Book Interest Rate Risk                               \n                                                                \nFor interest rate risk\npurposes, Citi\u2019s non-trading\nportfolios are referred to as\nthe Banking Book. Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Citigroup\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors.\n\nCorporate Treasury is\nresponsible for the day-to-day\nmanagement of Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook interest rate risk as\nwell as periodically reviewing\nit with the ALCO. Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from the second line\nof defense team reporting to\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in the level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rates\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in the maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in the interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits.\nInterest rate risk is\ntransferred via Citi\u2019s funds\ntransfer-pricing process to\nCiti Corporate Treasury. Citi\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income\nversus a base case. IRE does\nnot represent a forecast of\nCiti\u2019s net interest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in Citi\u2019s\nIRE analysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nCiti utilizes the most recent\nquarter-end balance sheet,\nassuming no changes to its\ncomposition and size over the\nforecasted horizon (holding\nthe balance sheet static). The\nforecasts incorporate\nexpectations and assumptions\nof deposit pricing, loan\nspreads and mortgage\nprepayment behavior implied by\nthe interest rate curves in\neach scenario. The base case\nscenario reflects the market-\nimplied forward interest\nrates, and sensitivity\nscenarios assume instantaneous\nshocks to the base case. The\nforecasts do not assume Citi\ntakes any risk-mitigating\nactions in response to changes\nin the interest rate\nenvironment. Certain interest\nrates are subject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities (i.e., deposit\nbetas) are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n                              102                               \nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nvalue at risk (VaR). It\nexcludes impacts from any\npositions that are included in\ntotal trading and credit\nportfolio VaR.\n\nIn addition to IRE, Citi\nanalyzes economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) as a longer-\nterm interest rate risk\nmetric. EVS is a net present\nvalue (NPV)\u2013based measure of\nthe lifetime cash flows of\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book. It\nestimates the interest rate\nsensitivity of the Banking\nBook\u2019s economic value from\nlonger-term assets being\npotentially funded with\nshorter-term liabilities, or\nvice versa. Citi manages EVS\nwithin risk limits approved by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of Directors\nthat are aligned with Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite.\n\nInterest Rate Risk of\nInvestment Portfolios\u2014Impact\n\non AOCI\n\nCiti measures the potential\nimpacts of changes in interest\nrates on the value of its AOCI\n, which can in turn impact\nCiti\u2019s common equity and\ntangible common equity. This\nwill impact Citi\u2019s CET1 and\nother regulatory capital\nratios. Citi seeks to manage\nits exposure to changes in the\nmarket level of interest\nrates, while limiting the\npotential impact on its AOCI\nand regulatory capital\nposition.\n\nAOCI at risk is managed as\npart of the Company-wide\ninterest rate risk position.\nAOCI at risk considers\npotential changes in AOCI (and\nthe corresponding impact on\nthe CET1 Capital ratio)\nrelative to Citi\u2019s capital\ngeneration capacity.\n\nCiti uses 100 basis point\n(bps) shocks in each scenario\nto reflect its net interest\nincome sensitivity to\nunanticipated changes in\nmarket interest rates, as\npotential monetary policy\ndecisions and changes in\neconomic conditions may be\nreflected in current market-\nimplied forward rates.\n\nThe following table presents\nthe 12-month estimated

The remaining\nimpact is spread across more\nthan 30 additional currencies.\n\nIn a 100 bps upward rate shock\nscenario, Citi expects that\nthe approximate $1.0 billion\ninitial negative impact to\nAOCI could potentially be\noffset in shareholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio and expected net\ninterest income benefit over a\nperiod of approximately six\nmonths.\n                              103                               \n                                                                \n  Scenario Analysis                                             \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income and AOCI\nunder eight different interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and all other\ncurrencies in which Citi has\ninvested capital as of\nDecember 31, 2024. The 100 bps\nand 200 bps downward rate\nscenarios potentially may be\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d). The interest\nrate scenarios are also\nimpacted by convexity related\nto mortgage products and\ndeposit pricing.\n                                                                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         1       2       3       4                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes\nthat the rate change will\noccur instantaneously.

The\ninterest rate exposure in the\ntable above assumes no change\nin deposit size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast included\nin the different interest rate\nscenarios presented. As a\nresult, in higher interest\nrate scenarios, customer\nactivity resulting in a shift\nfrom non-interest-bearing and\nlow interest rate deposit\nproducts to higher-yielding\ndeposits would reduce the\nexpected benefit to net\ninterest income. Conversely,\nin lower interest rate\nscenarios, customer activity\nresulting in a shift from\nhigher-yielding deposits to\nnon-interest-bearing and low\ninterest rate deposit products\nwould reduce the expected\ndecrease to net interest\nincome.\n\n(1) The Scenario 1 impact of\n$1,068 million consists of the\nfollowing top five non-U.S.\ndollar currencies as of\nDecember 31, 2024 by absolute\nsize: approximately $(0.2)\nbillion from the euro, $0.2\nbillion from the British pound\nsterling, and approximately\n$0.1 billion each from the\nChinese yuan, Swiss franc and\nIndian rupee. The remaining\nbalance is spread across more\nthan 30 additional currencies.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs presented in the table\nabove, the estimated impact to\nCiti\u2019s net interest income is\nlarger in the short end\ncompared to the long end as\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book has\nrelatively higher interest\nrate exposure to the short end\nof the yield curve. For the\nU.S. dollar, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is larger\nin magnitude than to upward\nrate shocks. This is because\nof the lower benefit to net\ninterest income from Citi\u2019s\ndeposit base at higher rate\nlevels, as well as the\nprepayment effects on mortgage\nloans and mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater in the short\nend compared to the long end.\nThis is because Citi\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio and\npension liabilities are more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                              104                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI\n                                                                \n  and Capital                                                   \n                                                                \nAs of December 31, 2024, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.5 billion,\nor 1.0%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This\nreduction in the TCE would be\nprimarily driven by\ndepreciation in the value of\nthe euro, Mexican peso and\nIndian rupee.\n\nThis reduction in the TCE does\nnot reflect any mitigating\nactions Citi may take,\nincluding ongoing management\nof its foreign currency\ntranslation exposure. TCE is\nused as a simplified metric to\nmanage CET1 capital ratio\nvolatility. Specifically, as\ncurrency movements change the\nvalue of Citi\u2019s net\ninvestments in foreign\ncurrency-denominated capital,\nthese movements also change\nthe value of Citi\u2019s RWA\n\ndenominated in those same\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s CET1\nCapital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates\n(versus the U.S. dollar), and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are presented\nin the table below.

reported\nbasis and $13.8 billion on a\ntaxable equivalent basis, a\ndecrease of $0.1 billion from\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by Markets\n(down approximately $0.1\nbillion), partially offset by\nnon- Markets (up approximately\n$0.04 billion). The decline in\nMarkets net interest income\nwas primarily driven by higher\nfunding costs related to\ntrading inventory in Fixed\nIncome Markets.\n\nThe increase in non- Markets\nnet interest income was\nlargely due to loan growth in\ncards in USPB and maturing\nassets in Citi\u2019s securities\nportfolio being reinvested at\nhigher yields, partially\noffset by net investment\nsecurities losses reflecting\nthe repositioning of the\ninvestment securities\nportfolio.\n\nCiti\u2019s net interest margin was\n2.42% on a taxable equivalent\nbasis in the fourth quarter of\n2024, an increase of nine\nbasis points from the prior\nquarter, largely driven by\nhigher Markets net interest\nmargin.\n\nCiti\u2019s net interest income for\n2024 decreased 1%, or\napproximately $0.8 billion, to\n$54.1 billion ($54.2 billion\non a taxable equivalent basis)\nversus the prior year. The\ndecrease was primarily due to\na decrease in non- Markets net\ninterest income, largely\ndriven by higher funding costs\nin the mortgage-backed\nsecurities portfolio in\nCorporate Treasury within All\nOther and lower revenue from\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nArgentina, partially offset by\ngrowth in USPB and Wealth .\n\nIn 2024, Citi\u2019s net interest\nmargin decreased to 2.40% on a\ntaxable equivalent basis,\ncompared to 2.46% in 2023,\nprimarily driven by lower\nrevenue from Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Argentina and\nhigher funding cost.\n                              107

Management of the\nmarket risk of Citi\u2019s trading\nportfolio is governed by the\nMark-to-Market Risk Policy and\nthe Markets Risk Management\nCommittee.\n\nThe market risk of Citi\u2019s\ntrading portfolios is\nmonitored using a combination\nof quantitative and\nqualitative measures,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nfactor sensitivities, value at\nrisk (VaR) and stress testing.\nEach trading portfolio across\nCiti\u2019s businesses has its own\nmarket risk limit framework\nencompassing these measures\nand other controls, including\ntrading mandates, new product\napproval, permitted product\nlists and pre-trade approval\nfor larger, more complex and\nless liquid transactions.\nThese controls enable the\nmonitoring and management of\nCiti\u2019s top market risks.\n\nThe following chart of total\ndaily trading-related revenue\n(loss) captures trading\nvolatility and shows the\nnumber of days in which\nrevenues for Citi\u2019s trading\nbusinesses fell within\nparticular ranges. Trading-\nrelated revenue includes\ntrading, net interest and\nother revenue associated with\nCiti\u2019s trading businesses. It\nexcludes DVA, FVA and CVA\nadjustments incurred due to\nchanges in the credit quality\nof counterparties, as well as\nany associated hedges of that\nCVA. In addition, it excludes\nfees and other revenue\nassociated with capital\nmarkets origination\nactivities. Trading-related\nrevenues are driven by both\ncustomer flows and the changes\nin valuation of the trading\ninventory. As presented in the\nchart below, Citi achieved\npositive trading-related\nrevenue for 98.5% of the\ntrading days in 2024.\n                                                     \n  Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss)(1)\u201412 Months  \n  Ended December 31, 2024                            \n  In millions of dollars                             \n                                                     \n(1) Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic\nhedges of certain AFS debt securities.

VaR statistics, which\nare based on historical data,\ncan be materially different\nacross firms due to\ndifferences in portfolio\ncomposition, VaR methodologies\nand model parameters. As a\nresult, Citi believes VaR\nstatistics can be used more\neffectively as indicators of\ntrends in risk-taking within a\nfirm, rather than as a basis\nfor inferring differences in\nrisk-taking across firms.\n\nCiti uses a single,\nindependently approved Monte\nCarlo simulation VaR model\n(see \u201cVaR Model Review and\nValidation\u201d below), which has\nbeen designed to capture\nmaterial risk sensitivities\n(such as first- and second-\norder\n\nsensitivities of positions to\nchanges in market prices) of\nvarious asset classes/risk\ntypes (such as interest rate,\ncredit spread, foreign\nexchange, equity and commodity\nrisks). Citi\u2019s VaR includes\npositions that are measured at\nfair value; it does not\ninclude investment securities\nclassified as AFS or HTM. See\nNote 14 for information on\nthese securities.\n\nCiti believes its VaR model is\nconservatively calibrated to\nincorporate fat-tail scaling\nand the greater of short-term\n(approximately the most recent\nmonth) and long-term (18\nmonths for commodities and\nthree years for others) market\nvolatility. The Monte Carlo\nsimulation involves\napproximately 550,000 market\nfactors, making use of\napproximately 480,000 time\nseries, with sensitivities\nupdated daily, volatility\nparameters updated intra-\nmonthly and correlation\nparameters updated monthly. As\nof December 31, 2024, Citi\nestimates that the\nconservative features of the\nVaR calibration contribute an\napproximate 24% add-on to what\nwould be a VaR estimated under\nthe assumption of stable and\nperfectly, normally\ndistributed markets.\n\nAs presented in the table\nbelow, Citi\u2019s average trading\nVaR decreased $10 million from\n2023 to 2024, due to reduced\nvolatility and changes in\nexposure. Citi\u2019s average\ntrading and credit portfolio\nVaR decreased $15 million, in\nline with the decline in\naverage trading VaR.\n\nYear-end and Average Trading\nVaR and Trading and Credit\nPortfolio

adjustment (also known as diversification\nbenefit) equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum\nof the VaRs tied to each risk type.

In addition, product-specific back-testing on\nportfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing\nmodel performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi\u2019s\nU.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VaR back-\ntesting (as described below) is performed against buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios\nacross the organization (trading desk level and total Citigroup)\nand the results are shared with U.S. banking regulators.\nMaterial VaR model and assumption changes must be independently\nvalidated within Citi\u2019s Independent Risk Management\norganization. All model changes, including those for the VaR\nmodel, are validated by the model validation group within Citi\u2019s\nModel Risk Management. In the event of significant model\nchanges, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to\nimplementation. In addition, significant model and assumption\nchanges are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by\nCiti\u2019s U.S. banking regulators. Citi uses the same independently\nvalidated VaR model for both Regulatory VaR and Risk Management\nVaR (i.e., total trading and total trading and credit portfolios\nVaRs) and, as such, the model review and validation process for\nboth purposes is as described above. Regulatory VaR, which is\ncalculated in accordance with Basel III, differs from Risk\nManagement VaR because certain positions included in Risk\nManagement VaR are not eligible\n\nfor market risk treatment in Regulatory VaR. The composition of\nRisk Management VaR is discussed under \u201cValue at Risk\u201d above.\nThe applicability of the VaR model for positions eligible for\nmarket risk treatment under U.S. regulatory capital rules is\nperiodically reviewed and approved by Citi\u2019s U.S. banking\nregulators. In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VaR\nincludes all trading book-covered positions and all foreign\nexchange and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III,\nRegulatory VaR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent\nand ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified\nas non-trading book and categories of exposures that are\nspecifically excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VaR\nexcludes CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi\u2019s own\nfair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from\nRegulatory VaR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as\ncomputed under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-\nweighted assets. Regulatory VaR Back-Testing In accordance with\nBasel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of its Regulatory VaR model. Regulatory VaR\nback-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VaR, at a\n99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit\nand loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is\nheld constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following\nday). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-\nmarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in\ncovered positions from the close of the previous business day.\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue,\nnet interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VaR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VaR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions.\n                              114                               \nThe following graph presents\nthe daily buy-and-hold profit\nand loss associated with\nCiti\u2019s covered positions\ncompared to Citi\u2019s one-day\nRegulatory VaR during 2024.\nDuring 2024, no back-testing\nexceptions were observed at\nthe Citigroup level.\n\nThe difference between the\n58.8% of days with buy-and-\nhold gains for Regulatory VaR\nback-testing and the 98.5% of\ndays with trading, net\ninterest and other revenue\nassociated with Citi\u2019s trading\nbusinesses, presented in the\nhistogram of daily trading-\nrelated revenue below,\nreflects, among other things,\nthat a significant portion of\nCiti\u2019s trading-related revenue\nis not generated from daily\nprice movements on these\npositions and exposures, as\nwell as differences in the\nportfolio composition of\nRegulatory VaR and Risk\nManagement VaR.\n                                                      \n  Regulatory Trading VaR and Associated Buy-and-Hold  \n  Profit and Loss(1)\u201412 Months Ended December 31,     \n  2024                                                \n  In millions of dollars                              \n                                                      \n(1) Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking\nregulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market\nrevenue movement attributable to the trading position from the\nclose of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss\nexcludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day\ntrading profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as\nchanges in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the\ntrading-related revenue presented in the chart of daily trading-\nrelated revenue above.\n                              115                               \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                \nCiti performs market risk\nstress testing on a regular\nbasis to estimate the impact\nof extreme market movements.\nIt is performed on individual\npositions and trading\nportfolios, as well as in\naggregate, inclusive of\nmultiple trading portfolios.\nCiti\u2019s market risk management,\nafter consultations with the\nbusinesses, develops both\nsystemic and specific stress\nscenarios, reviews the output\nof periodic stress testing\nexercises and uses the\ninformation to assess the\nongoing appropriateness of\nexposure levels and limits.\nCiti uses two complementary\napproaches to market risk\nstress testing across all\nmajor risk factors (i.e.,\nequity, foreign exchange,\ncommodity, interest rate and\ncredit spreads): top-down\nsystemic stresses and bottom-\nup business-specific stresses.\nSystemic stresses are designed\nto quantify the potential\nimpact of extreme market\nmovements on an institution-\nwide basis, and are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical periods of market\nstress and projections of\nadverse economic scenarios.\nBusiness-specific stresses are\ndesigned to probe the risks of\nparticular portfolios and\nmarket segments, especially\nthose risks that are not fully\ncaptured in VaR and systemic\nstresses.\n\nThe systemic stress scenarios\nand business-specific stress\nscenarios at Citi are used in\nseveral reports reviewed by\nsenior management and also to\ncalculate internal risk\ncapital for trading market\nrisk, as well as enable the\nmonitoring and managing of\nCiti\u2019s top market risks.\n\nIn general, changes in market\nvalues are defined over a one-\nyear horizon. For the most\nliquid positions and market\nfactors, changes in market\nvalues are defined over a\nshorter two-month horizon. The\nlimited set of positions and\nmarket factors whose market\nvalue changes are defined over\na two-month horizon are those\nthat in management\u2019s judgment\nhave historically remained\nvery liquid during financial\ncrises, even as the trading\nliquidity of most other\npositions and market factors\nmaterially declined.\n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISK                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nOperational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, human error or\nsystems errors, or external\nevents. As discussed further\nbelow, operational risk\nincludes cybersecurity risk.\nIt also includes legal risk,\nwhich is the risk of loss\n(including litigation costs,\nsettlements and regulatory\nfines) resulting from the\nfailure of Citi to comply with\nlaws, regulations, prudent\nethical standards and\ncontractual obligations in any\naspect of its businesses, but\nexcludes strategic and\nreputation risks. Citi also\nrecognizes the impact of\noperational risk on the\nreputation risk associated\nwith Citi\u2019s business\nactivities.\n\nOperational risk is inherent\nin Citi\u2019s global business\nactivities, as well as related\nsupport functions, and can\nresult in losses. Citi\nmaintains a comprehensive\nCompany-wide risk taxonomy to\nclassify operational risks\nthat it faces using\nstandardized definitions\nacross Citi\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement Framework (see\ndiscussion below). This\ntaxonomy also supports\nregulatory requirements and\nexpectations inclusive of\nthose related to U.S. Basel\nIII, Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR),\n\nHeightened Standards for Large\nFinancial Institutions and\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST).\n\nCiti manages operational risk\nconsistent with the overall\nframework described in\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Overview\u201d above. Citi\u2019s\ngoal is to keep operational\nrisk at appropriate levels\nrelative to the\ncharacteristics of its\nbusinesses, the markets in\nwhich it operates, its capital\nand liquidity and the\ncompetitive, economic and\nregulatory environment. This\nincludes effectively managing\noperational risk and\nmaintaining or reducing\noperational risk exposures\nwithin Citi\u2019s operational risk\nappetite.\n\nCiti\u2019s Independent Operational\nRisk Management group has\nestablished a global\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework with policies and\npractices for identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting\noperational risks and the\noverall operating\neffectiveness of the internal\ncontrol environment. As part\nof this framework, Citi has\ndefined its operational risk\nappetite and established a\nManager\u2019s Control Assessment\n(MCA) process for self-\nidentification of significant\noperational risks, assessment\nof the performance of key\ncontrols and mitigation of\nresidual risk above acceptable\nlevels.\n\nEach Citi operating segment\nmust implement operational\nrisk management processes\nconsistent with the\nrequirements of this\nframework. This includes:\n\n\u2022 understanding and assessing\nthe operational risks they are\nexposed to;\n\n\u2022 designing, executing and\ntesting controls that mitigate\nidentified risks;\n\n\u2022 establishing key indicators;\n\n\u2022 monitoring and reporting\nwhether the operational risk\nexposures are in or out of\ntheir operational risk\nappetite;\n\n\u2022 having processes in place to\nbring operational risk\nexposures within acceptable\nlevels;\n\n\u2022 periodically estimating and\naggregating the operational\nrisks they are exposed to; and\n\n\u2022 ensuring that sufficient\nresources are available to\nactively improve the\noperational risk environment\nand mitigate emerging risks.\n\nCiti considers operational\nrisks that result from the\nintroduction of new or changes\nto existing products, or\nresult from significant\nchanges in its organizational\nstructures, systems, processes\nand personnel.\n\nCiti has a governance\nstructure for the oversight of\noperational risk exposures\nthrough Business Risk and\nControls Committees (BRCCs),\nwhich are focused at the\ngroup, business or function,\nor geography level. BRCCs\nprovide channels to inform and\nescalate to senior management\nabout operational risk\nexposures, control issues and\noperational risk events, and\nallow them to take and\ndocument decisions around the\nmitigation, remediation or\nacceptance of operational risk\nexposures.\n\nIn addition, Independent Risk\nManagement, including the\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup, works proactively with\nCiti\u2019s businesses and\nfunctions to drive a strong\nand embedded operational risk\nmanagement culture and\nframework across Citi. The\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup actively challenges\nbusiness and functions\nimplementation of the\n                              116                               \nOperational Risk Management\nFramework requirements and the\nquality of operational risk\nmanagement practices and\noutcomes.\n\nInformation about businesses\u2019\nkey operational risks,\nhistorical operational risk\nlosses and the control\nenvironment is reported by\neach major business segment\nand functional area. Citi\u2019s\noperational risk profile and\nrelated information is\nsummarized and reported to\nsenior management, as well as\nto the Audit and Risk\nCommittees of Citigroup\u2019s\nBoard of Directors by the Head\nof Operational Risk\nManagement.\n\nOperational risk is measured\nthrough Operational Risk\nCapital and Operational Risk\nRegulatory Capital for the\nAdvanced Approaches under\nBasel III. Projected\noperational risk losses under\nstress scenarios are estimated\nas a required part of the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR process.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s operational risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisks\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Cybersecurity Risk                                            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nCybersecurity risk is the\nbusiness risk associated with\nthe threat posed by a\ncyberattack, cyber breach or\nthe failure to protect Citi\u2019s\nmost vital business\ninformation assets or\noperations, resulting in a\nfinancial or reputational loss\n(see the operational processes\nand systems and cybersecurity\nrisk factors in \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). With an evolving\nthreat landscape, ever-\nincreasing sophistication of\nthreat actor tactics,\ntechniques and procedures,\nongoing and emerging\ngeopolitical conflicts, and\nthe use of new technologies,\nincluding those enabled by\nartificial intelligence and\nmachine learning capabilities,\nto conduct financial\ntransactions, Citi and its\nclients, customers and third\nparties (and fourth parties,\netc.) continue to be at risk\nfrom cyberattacks and\ninformation security\nincidents. Citi leverages a\nthreat-focused, defense-in-\ndepth strategy that ensures\nthat multiple controls work in\ntandem against various threats\nto increase the likelihood\nthat malicious activity will\nbe prevented, detected and\nmitigated.\n\nCiti has a mature\ncybersecurity threat\nidentification and management\nprogram that relies on an\nindustry-aligned, risk-based,\ndefense-in-depth approach,\nincluding an internal\ncybersecurity intelligence\ncenter, participation in\nindustry and government\ninformation-sharing programs,\nvulnerability assessment and\nscanning tools, intrusion\ndetection and prevention\nsystems, security incident and\nevent management systems,\nfirewalls, penetration\ntesting, adversary emulation\nexercises, data management\n(including classification,\nencryption at rest and in\ntransit, and access\nmanagement), multi-factor\nauthentication requirements\nand other logical, physical\nand technical controls\ndesigned to prevent, deter,\nmitigate and respond to\ncybersecurity threats.\n\nCiti\u2019s cyber and information\nsecurity program is supported\nby comprehensive governance,\nincluding policies, standards\nand procedures that dictate\nrequirements and best\npractices around various\nprogram aspects, including,\nbut not limited to, third-\nparty risk management, data\nmanagement, asset management,\ninformation security\npractices, security incident\nmanagement and regulatory\ncompliance. Citi\u2019s Chief\nInformation Security\nOrganization\u2019s risks and\ncontrols are\n\nmeasured against its\nCybersecurity Risk Appetite\nStatement, which was initially\napproved by the Risk\nManagement Committee of the\nBoard of Directors and is\nreapproved annually by Citi\u2019s\nRisk Committee, chaired by\nCiti\u2019s Chief Risk Officer.\nCiti\u2019s Cybersecurity Risk\nAppetite Statement leverages\nkey risk indicators to\nestablish enterprise risk\ntolerance and define risk\nmanagement strategy with\nrespect to cyber and\ninformation security. Further,\nCiti actively participates in\nfinancial industry, government\nand cross-sector knowledge-\nsharing groups to enhance\nindividual and collective\ncybersecurity preparedness and\nresilience.\n                                                                \n  Cybersecurity Risk Management and Governance                  \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s technology and\ncybersecurity risk management\nprogram is built on Citi\u2019s\nthree lines of defense, each\nof which is integrated into\nCiti\u2019s overall risk management\nsystems and processes. Citi\u2019s\nChief Information Security\nOffice, which is led by Citi\u2019s\nHead of Foundational Services\nand Chief Information Security\nOfficer (CISO), serves as the\nfirst line of defense. This\noffice provides frontline\nbusiness, operational and\ntechnical controls and\ncapabilities to (1) protect\nagainst cybersecurity risks,\nand (2) respond to cyber\nincidents, including data\nbreaches. Citi manages\ncybersecurity threats through\nits state-of-the-art fusion\ncenters, which serve as\ncentral commands for\nmonitoring and coordinating\nresponses to cyber threats.\nCiti\u2019s Chief Information\nSecurity Organization is\nresponsible for application\nand infrastructure defense and\nsecurity controls, performing\nvulnerability assessments and\nthird-party information\nsecurity assessments\n(including cybersecurity risk\nassessments associated with\nCiti\u2019s use of products and\nservices from vendors and\nother third-party providers),\nemployee awareness and\ntraining programs, and\nsecurity incident management.\nIn each case, the enterprise\ninformation security team\nworks in coordination with a\nnetwork of information\nsecurity officers who are\nembedded within Citi\u2019s global\nbusinesses and functions,\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\nphilosophy that all Citi\nstakeholders have a\nresponsibility in managing\ncyber and information security\nrisks. Citi\u2019s Technology and\nCyber Compliance and\nOperational Risk Office\n(TCCORO) serves as the second\nline of defense. This office\nindependently evaluates and\nchallenges Citi\u2019s risk\nmitigation practices and\ncapabilities, from a fused\noperational risk and\ncompliance lens. It functions\nas a joint second line of\ndefense and in accordance with\nCiti\u2019s Cybersecurity Risk\nAppetite Statement. TCCORO\nalso advises first line\npartners in CISO, supporting\nenterprise-wide efforts to\nproactively identify and\nremediate cybersecurity risks\nbefore they materialize as\nincidents that negatively\naffect business operations. To\naddress evolving cybersecurity\nrisks and corresponding\nregulations, TCCORO monitors\ncybersecurity legal and\nregulatory requirements,\nidentifies and defines\nemerging risks, executes\nstrategic cybersecurity threat\nassessments, performs new\nproduct and initiative\nreviews, performs data\nmanagement risk oversight and\nconducts cybersecurity risk\nassurance reviews (inclusive\nof third-party assessments).\nIn addition, this office\noversees and challenges\n                              117                               \nmetrics related to\ncybersecurity and technology\nand ensures they remain\naligned with Citi\u2019s overall\noperational risk management\nframework to effectively\ntrack, identify and manage\nrisk. TCCORO presents an\nindependent viewpoint on\nenterprise cybersecurity risk\nposture, and oversees CISO\u2019s\ncybersecurity risk\nidentification, measurement\nand enterprise-wide governance\nof cybersecurity risk.\nInternal Audit serves as\nCiti\u2019s third line of defense\nand provides independent\nassurance to the Audit\nCommittee of the Board on the\neffectiveness of controls\noperated by the first and\nsecond lines of defense to\nmanage cybersecurity risk.\n\nCiti recognizes the risks\nassociated with outsourcing\nservices to, sharing data\nwith, and/or technologically\ninteracting with third\nparties. Citi has built a\nrobust third-party information\nsecurity risk management\nprogram that governs third-\nparty engagements from\nselection, to the\nestablishment of legal\nagreements that govern the\nrelationship, to ongoing\nmonitoring through the\nduration of the\nrelationship.Third-party risk\nmanagement includes reliance\non contractual requirements\naround data and cybersecurity,\nvulnerability assessments,\nthird-party information\nsecurity assessments performed\nat intervals determined by\nrisk level, governance to\nmanage end-of-life and end-of-\nvendor-support risks, and\nthird-party incident response\nprotocols.\n                                                                \n  Management Governance                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Head of Technology and\nBusiness Enablement, who\nreports directly to Citi\u2019s\nCEO, has overall\nresponsibility for Citi\u2019s\nfirst line of defense cyber\nand information security and\ntechnology programs. Citi\u2019s\nHead of Technology and\nBusiness Enablementhas over 30\nyears of experience in the\nfinancial services industry.\nPrior to joining Citi, he was\nSenior Partner at\nPriceWaterhouseCoopers where\nhe oversaw the firm\u2019s strategy\nand execution.For additional\ninformation, see \u201cCorporate\nInformation\u2014Executive\nOfficers\u201d below. Citi\u2019s Head\nof Foundational Services and\nCISO, who reports directly to\nCiti\u2019s Head of Technology and\nBusiness Enablement, has\nprimary responsibility to\nassess and manage Citi\u2019s\nmaterial risks from\ncybersecurity threats. Citi\u2019s\nCISO has decades of experience\nin managing cybersecurity\nrisks from prior roles as\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s Chief Security\nOfficer, the Chief Information\nOfficer for the Central\nIntelligence Agency and the\nChief Information Officer for\nthe U.S. Intelligence\nCommunity. The CISO is\nsupported by a team of subject\nmatter experts in security\noperations, network\narchitecture, cyber and\ninformation security\ngovernance and cybersecurity\noperations. Citi\u2019s Chief\nInformation Security Office\nemploys approximately 3,400\nindividuals to manage its\noperations. Citi\u2019s Chief\nTechnology Officer (CTO) and\nHead of Emerging Technology\nand Strategic Partnerships,\nwho also reports to Citi\u2019s\nChief Information Officer, has\nprimary responsibility for\ntechnology policy, innovation\nenablement and strategy.\nCiti\u2019s CTO has served in\nvarious technology roles at\nCiti since 2012, including\nmost recently as Group Head of\nEngineering and Architecture.\nPrior to joining Citi, the CTO\nworked in equity linked\ntechnology at Bank of America\nMerrill Lynch. Multiple\nmanagement committees and\nfunctions also support Citi\u2019s\ncyber and information security\nmanagement.\n\nThe Chief Information Officer\nCommittee (CIOC), which\nconsists of, among others, the\nHead of Technology and\nBusiness Enablement, Citi\u2019s\nCo-Chief Information Officers\n(who report to the Head of\nTechnology and Business\nEnablement), the CISO, and the\nHead of TCCORO (who reports\nboth to Citi\u2019s Head of\nOperational Risk within the\nRisk organization and its Head\nof Global Functions Compliance\nwithin the Global Legal and\nCompliance organization),\nserves as an escalation forum\nfor items requiring the\nattention of technology senior\nmanagement, including approval\nof policies, and reports items\nrequiring further escalation\nto the Technology Committee of\nthe Board of Directors, as\nappropriate. The Information\nSecurity Risk Operating\nCommittee (ISROC) is chaired\nby the CISO and comprises\nsenior members of the Chief\nInformation Security Office\nand representatives from\npartner organizations. This\ncommittee sets the direction\nand prioritization for the\nimplementation of the cyber\nand information security\nprogram across Citi. The\ncommittee reports and\nescalates to the CIOC,\nincluding for intermediary\nreview and approval of\npolicies escalated from the\nInformation Technology Policy\nCouncil (see below). Any\nactions constituting risk\nexceptions are escalated to\nthe ISRC. The Security\nArchitecture Council, which\nreports to the ISROC, is an\noversight and decision-making\nbody focused on ensuring that\nthe target level of security\narchitectural maturity is\nattained. This council is co-\nchaired by two representatives\nfrom the security architecture\nand cybersecurity services\norganizations. Citi\u2019s\nInformation Technology Policy\nCouncil provides a centralized\nreview to oversee consistency\nin the formation of\ninformation technology\npolicies and standards. This\ncounsel maintains oversight of\npolicy document requirements\nto ensure that information\ntechnology policy documents\nmeet Citi\u2019s objectives as\nestablished internally and are\nin line with laws and\nregulations as identified and\ncommunicated by ICRM.\n\nIn addition, Citi regularly\nengages third parties globally\nto assess, audit and/or\nexercise Citi\u2019s cyber and\ninformation security program,\nwhich is ISO-27001 certified.\nISO-27001 is an international\nstandard for information\nsecurity management systems.\nCiti is regulated by bodies\nacross the globe that also\nregularly examine and audit\nCiti\u2019s cyber and information\nsecurity program against local\nlaws, regulations and industry\nbest practices.\n                              118                               \nBoard Governance Citigroup\u2019s\nBoard of Directors and its\ncommitteesprovide oversight of\nsenior management\u2019s efforts to\nmitigate cybersecurity risk\nand respond to cybersecurity\nincidents. Citi\u2019s Board\nincludes members with\ncybersecurity expertise and\nexperience. Citigroup\u2019s full\nBoard is briefed annually on\ncybersecurity risks and\nreceives updates as needed on\nCiti\u2019s cyber and information\nsecurity program, including\nchanges to the threat\nlandscape and a roadmap for\nprogress around addressing\nrelated risks. Additionally,\nCitigroup\u2019s Board participates\nin cybersecurity exercises to\nimprove preparedness to\naddress cybersecurity\nincidents. The Board\u2019s\nTechnology Committee receives\nquarterly updates from the\nChief Information Security\nOffice on the cybersecurity\nthreat landscape, regulatory\nlandscape, posture, and\nstrategy and engages in\ndiscussions throughout the\nyear with senior management\nand subject matter experts on\nthe effectiveness of Citi\u2019s\noverall cybersecurity program.\nThe Board\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee (RMC) approved a\nstandalone Cybersecurity Risk\nAppetite Statement against\nwhich Citi\u2019s performance is\nmeasured quarterly. In\naddition, the RMC oversees\nCiti\u2019s risk profile, which\nincludes cybersecurity risk,\nand monitors whether Citi is\noperating within its\ncybersecurity risk appetite\nunder its mandate to review\nkey operational risks,\nincluding steps taken by\nmanagement to control such\nrisks. In the event of a\npotentially material\ncybersecurity incident\nimpacting Citi, the Board\nwould be made aware of such\nincident via lines of\ncommunication that run from\nthe Chief Information Security\nOffice to senior management\nand also to the Board. This\ncontemporaneous reporting on\nsignificant cyber events\nincludes information and\ndiscussion around incident\nresponse, legal obligations\n(including disclosure), and\noutreach and notification to\nregulators and customers when\nneeded.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe Board\u2019s oversight of\ncybersecurity risk management,\nsee Citi\u2019s upcoming 2025\nAnnual Meeting Proxy Statement\nto be filed with the SEC in\nMarch 2025.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCompliance risk is the risk to\ncurrent or projected financial\ncondition and resilience\narising from violations of\nlaws, rules or regulations, or\nfrom non-conformance with\nprescribed practices, internal\npolicies and procedures or\nethical standards. Compliance\nrisk exposes Citi to fines,\ncivil money penalties, payment\nof damages and the voiding of\ncontracts. Compliance risk can\nresult in diminished\nreputation, harm to Citi\u2019s\ncustomers, limited business\nopportunities and lessened\nexpansion potential. It\nencompasses the risk of\nnoncompliance with all laws\nand regulations, as well as\nprudent ethical standards and\nsome contractual obligations.\nIt could also include exposure\nto litigation (known as legal\nrisk) from all aspects of\ntraditional and non-\ntraditional banking.\n\nCiti seeks to operate with\nintegrity, maintain strong\nethical standards and adhere\nto applicable policies and\nregulatory and legal\nrequirements. Citi must\nmaintain and execute a\nproactive Compliance Risk\nManagement (CRM) Framework (as\nset forth in the CRM Policy)\nthat is designed to\n\nmanage compliance risk\neffectively across Citi, with\na view to fundamentally\nstrengthen the compliance risk\nmanagement culture across the\nlines of defense taking into\naccount Citi\u2019s risk governance\nframework and regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement\u2019s (ICRM) primary\nobjectives are to:\n\n\u2022 Drive and embed a culture of\ncompliance and control\nthroughout Citi;\n\n\u2022 Maintain and oversee an\nintegrated CRM Framework that\nfacilitates enterprise-wide\ncompliance with local,\nnational or cross-border laws,\nrules or regulations, Citi\u2019s\ninternal policies, standards\nand procedures and relevant\nstandards of conduct;\n\n\u2022 Assess compliance risks and\nissues across product lines,\nfunctions and geographies,\nsupported by globally\nconsistent systems and\ncompliance risk management\nprocesses; and\n\n\u2022 Provide compliance risk data\naggregation and reporting\ncapabilities.\n\nCiti carries out its\nobjectives and fulfills its\nresponsibilities through the\nCRM Framework, which is\ncomposed of the following\nintegrated key activities, to\nholistically manage compliance\nrisk:\n\n\u2022 Management of Citi\u2019s\ncompliance with laws, rules\nand regulations by identifying\nand analyzing changes,\nassessing the impact and\nimplementing appropriate\npolicies, processes and\ncontrols;\n\n\u2022 Developing and providing\ncompliance training to ensure\nemployees are aware of and\nunderstand the key laws, rules\nand regulations;\n\n\u2022 Monitoring the Compliance\nRisk Appetite, which is\narticulated through\nqualitative compliance risk\nstatements describing Citi\u2019s\nappetite for certain types of\nrisk and quantitative measures\nto monitor the Company\u2019s\ncompliance risk exposure;\n\n\u2022 Executing Compliance Risk\nAssessments, the results of\nwhich inform Compliance Risk\nMonitoring and testing of\ncompliance risks and controls\nin assessing conformance with\nlaws, rules, regulations and\ninternal policies; and\n\n\u2022 Issue identification,\nescalation and remediation to\ndrive accountability,\nincluding measurement and\nreporting of compliance risk\nmetrics against established\nthresholds in support of the\nCRM Policy and Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nTo anticipate, control and\nmitigate compliance risk, Citi\nhas established the CRM Policy\nto achieve standardization and\ncentralization of\nmethodologies and processes,\nand to enable more consistent\nand comprehensive execution of\ncompliance risk management.\n\nCiti has a commitment, as well\nas an obligation, to identify,\nassess and mitigate compliance\nrisks associated with its\nbusinesses and functions. ICRM\nis responsible for oversight\nof Citi\u2019s CRM Policy, while\nall businesses and global\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for managing their\ncompliance risks and operating\nwithin the Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n                              119                               \nAs discussed above, Citi is\nworking to address the FRB and\nOCC Consent Orders and the\nOCC\u2019s 2024 Consent Order\nAmendment, which include\nimprovements to Citi\u2019s CRM\nFramework and its enterprise-\nwide application (see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nMultiyear Transformation \u2014 FRB\nand OCC Consent Orders\nCompliance\u201d above).\n                                                                \n  REPUTATION RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s reputation is a vital\nasset in building trust, and\nCiti is diligent in enhancing\nand protecting its reputation\nwith its key stakeholders. To\nsupport this, Citi has\ndeveloped a reputation risk\nframework. Under this\nframework, Citigroup and\nCitibank, N.A. have\nimplemented a risk appetite\nstatement and related key\nindicators to monitor\ncorporate activities and\noperations relative to Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite. The framework\nalso requires that business\nsegments escalate potential\nmaterial reputation risks that\nrequire review or mitigation\nthrough the applicable\nbusiness Management Forum or\nGroup Reputation Risk\nCommittee.\n\nThe Group Reputation Risk\nCommittee and Management\nForums, which are composed of\nCiti\u2019s senior executives,\ngovern the process by which\nmaterial reputation risks are\nidentified, measured,\nmonitored, controlled,\nescalated and reported. The\nGroup Reputation Risk\nCommittee and Management\nForums determine the\nappropriate actions to be\ntaken in line with risk\nappetite and regulatory\nexpectations, while promoting\na culture of risk awareness\nand high standards of\nintegrity and ethical behavior\nacross the Company, consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition. The Group\nReputation Risk Committee may\nescalate reputation risks to\nthe Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee or\nother appropriate committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n\nEvery Citi employee is\nresponsible for safeguarding\nCiti\u2019s reputation, guided by\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nEmployees are expected to\nexercise sound judgment and\ncommon sense in decisions and\nactions. They are also\nexpected to promptly escalate\nall issues that present\nmaterial reputation risk in\nline with policy.\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \nAs discussed above, strategic\nrisk is the risk of a\nsustained impact (not episodic\nimpact) to Citi\u2019s core\nstrategic objectives as\nmeasured by impacts on\nanticipated earnings, market\ncapitalization or capital,\narising from external factors\naffecting the Company\u2019s\noperating environment, as well\nas the risks associated with\ndefining and executing the\nstrategy, which are\nidentified, measured and\nmanaged as part of the\nStrategic Risk Framework at\nthe Enterprise Level.\n\nIn this context, external\nfactors affecting Citi\u2019s\noperating environment are the\neconomic environment,\ngeopolitical/political\nlandscape,\nindustry/competitive\nlandscape, environmental,\ncustomer/client behavior,\nregulatory/legislative\nenvironment and trends related\nto investors/shareholders.\nMaterial strategic risks that\nCiti is monitoring include the\nimpacts of adverse changes in\ninflation and interest rates\nin the U.S., as well as\nmacroeconomic uncertainties\ndriven by weak global growth,\ntariffs and geopolitical\nissues, including the Middle\nEast conflict, the\nRussia\u2013Ukraine war and\nU.S.\u2013China tensions, and\nincreased regulatory\nrequirements. In addition to\n\nexternal factors affecting\nCiti\u2019s operating environment,\nCiti also monitors risks\nrelated to the execution of\nits strategy, with heightened\nfocus on delivering the\ntransformation of its risk and\ncontrol environment pursuant\nto the 2020 FRB and OCC\nConsent Orders and the 2024\nAmendment to the OCC\u2019s Consent\nOrder.\n\nCiti\u2019s Executive Management\nTeam is responsible for the\ndevelopment and execution of\nCiti\u2019s strategy. This strategy\nis translated into forward-\nlooking plans (collectively\nCiti\u2019s Strategic Plan) that\nare then cascaded across the\norganization. Citi\u2019s Strategic\nPlan is presented to the Board\non an annual basis, and is\naligned with risk appetite\nthresholds and includes a risk\nassessment as required by\ninternal frameworks. It is\nalso aligned with limit\nrequirements for capital\nallocation. Governance and\noversight of strategic risk is\nfacilitated by internal\ncommittees on a group-wide\nbasis.\n\nCiti works to ensure that\nstrategic risks are adequately\nconsidered and addressed\nacross its various risk\nmanagement activities, and\nthat strategic risks are\nassessed in the context of\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite. Citi\nconducts a top-down, bottom-up\nrisk identification process to\nidentify risks, including\nstrategic risks. Business\nsegments undertake a quarterly\nrisk identification process to\nsystematically identify and\ndocument all material risks\nfaced by Citi. Independent\nRisk Management oversees the\nrisk identification process\nthrough regular reviews and\ncoordinates identification and\nmonitoring of top risks. In\naddition, Citi performs a\nquarterly Risk Assessment of\nthe Plan (RAOP) and\ncontinuously monitors risks\nassociated with its execution\nof strategy. Independent Risk\nManagement also manages\nstrategic risk by monitoring\nrisk appetite thresholds in\nconjunction with its Global\nStrategic Risk Committee,\nwhich is part of the\ngovernance structure that Citi\nhas in place to manage its\nstrategic risks.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s strategic risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nabove.\n                                                                \n  Climate Risk                                                  \n                                                                \nClimate change presents near-\nand long-term risks to Citi\nand its clients and customers,\nwith the risks expected to\nincrease over time. Climate\nrisk refers to the risk of\nloss arising from climate\nchange and comprises both\nphysical risk and transition\nrisk.\n\nClimate risk is an overarching\nrisk that can act as a driver\nof other categories of risk,\nsuch as credit risk from\nobligors exposed to high\nclimate risk, strategic risks\nif Citi fails to consider\ntransition risk in client\nselection, reputational risk\nfrom increased stakeholder\nconcerns about financing or\nfailing to finance high-carbon\nindustries and operational\nrisk from physical risks to\nCiti\u2019s facilities. Citi\ncontinues to make progress\ntoward embedding climate-\nrelated considerations into\nits overarching risk\nmanagement approach, driven by\nthe materiality of the\nfinancial and strategic risk\nconsiderations. For additional\ninformation on climate risk,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisks\u201d above.\n\nCiti continues to develop\nglobally consistent principles\nand approaches for managing\nclimate risk across the\nCompany through its Climate\nRisk Management Framework\n(Climate RMF). The Climate RMF\nprovides information on the\ngovernance, roles and\nresponsibilities, and\nprinciples to\n                              120                               \nsupport the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting of\nclimate risks.\n\nCiti continues to enhance its\nmethodologies for quantifying\nhow climate risks could impact\nthe individual credit profiles\nof its clients across various\nsectors. Citi has developed\nand embedded sector-specific\nclimate risk assessments in\nits credit underwriting\nprocess for certain sectors\nthat have been identified as\nhigher climate risk. Such\nclimate risk assessments are\ndesigned to incorporate\npublicly available client\ndisclosures and data from\nthird-party providers and\nfacilitate conversations with\nclients on their most material\nclimate risks and management\nplans for adaptation and\nmitigation. These assessments\nhelp Citi to better understand\nits clients\u2019 businesses and\nclimate-related risks, and\nsupport their financial needs.\n\nCiti also reviews factors\nrelated to climate risk\nassociated with financed\nprojects and clients in\ncertain sectors under its\nEnvironmental and Social Risk\nManagement (ESRM) Policy.\nCiti\u2019s ESRM Policy describes\nsector approaches to certain\nhigh-carbon sectors, including\nthermal coal mining and power.\n\nFurthermore, Citi participates\nin financial industry and\nregulatory initiatives that\ninform the measurement and\nassessment of potential\nfinancial risks of climate\nchange, including scenario\nanalysis. Citi also continues\nto monitor and actively engage\nwith regulators on climate\nrisk and sustainable finance\ndevelopments.\n\nFor additional information\nabout sustainability at Citi,\nsee \u201cNet Zero and\nSustainability\u201d above.\n                              121                               \n                                                                \n  OTHER RISKS                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of December 31, 2024.\n(Including the U.S., Citi\u2019s\ntop 25 exposures by country\nwould represent approximately\n98% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries as of December 31,\n2024.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower. For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries, most\nsignificantly in the United\nKingdom (U.K.) and Ireland,\n\nin order to more efficiently\nserve its corporate customers.\nAs an example, with respect to\nthe U.K., only 43% of\ncorporate loans presented in\nthe table below are to U.K.\ndomiciled counterparties (47%\nfor unfunded commitments),\nwith the balance of the loans\npredominately to\ncounterparties domiciled in\nother European countries.\nApproximately 90% of the total\nU.K. funded loans and 87% of\nthe total U.K. unfunded\ncommitments were investment\ngrade as of December 31, 2024.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

Due to sanctions restrictions, as well\nas Citi being unable to enter into reverse repos beginning in\nthe third quarter of 2024, any excess liquidity is placed with\nthe Central Bank of Russia.\n\n(3) Represents dividends relating to Russian securities held by\nCiti in its role as custodian for clients in Russia, which Citi\nis required by local regulation to hold at the DIA. Citi is\nunable to remit these funds, which are held at clients\u2019 risk, to\nthese clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment.\n\n(4) Clients\u2019 exposure of $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2024,\nprimarily consists of corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit\nto its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment and are held with the DIA.\n\n(5) Citigroup\u2019s CTA loss of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2024\nincluded in its AOCI related to its indirect subsidiary, AO\nCitibank, and $0.9 billion of intercompany liabilities owed by\nAO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia are excluded\nfrom the above table.

Total clients\u2019\nexposures decreased $0.1\nbillion to $7.4 billion,\nprimarily driven by\ndepreciation of the Russian\nruble, partially offset by\ninflows from dividends\nreceived from Russian\ncorporations on behalf of\nCiti\u2019s clients. As discussed\nin the table above, clients\u2019\nexposures primarily consist of\ncorporate dividends that Citi\ncannot remit to its clients\ndue to restrictions imposed by\nthe Russian government and are\nheld with the DIA at clients\u2019\nrisk.\n\nCiti hedges its Russian\nruble/U.S. dollar spot FX\nexposure in AOCI through the\npurchase of FX derivatives.\nThe ongoing mark-to-market of\nthe hedging derivatives is\nalso reported in AOCI . When\nthe Russian ruble depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar, the\nU.S. dollar equivalent value\nof Citigroup\u2019s investment in\nAO Citibank also declines.\nThis change in value is offset\nby the change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative). Going forward,\nCiti may record devaluations\non its net ruble-denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nthe benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposures.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nServices , Markets , Banking\nand All Other \u2014Legacy\nFranchises results have been\nimpacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including the\nwar in Ukraine and its direct\nand indirect impacts on the\nEuropean and global economies.\nFor a broader discussion of\nthe impacts of these factors\nand volatilities on Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and each business\u2019s\nresults of operations above.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included less\nthan $0.1 billion of remaining\ncredit reserves for Citi\u2019s\ndirect Russian counterparties\n(largely unchanged from\nSeptember 30, 2024). This\nbalance does not include the\nadditional reserves for\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures in Russia.\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbanking businesses, including\nactively pursuing portfolio\nsales. In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi has incurred\napproximately $73 million to\ndate in charges, largely from\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges. Citi expects\nto incur an additional\napproximate $30 million in\nestimated charges (in All\nOther , excluding the impact\nfrom any portfolio sales). For\nadditional information about\nCiti\u2019s continued efforts to\nreduce its operations and\nexposure in Russia, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above and Note 2.\n                                                                \n  Deconsolidation Risk                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s remaining operations in\nRussia subject it to various\nrisks, including, among\nothers, foreign currency\nvolatility, including\nappreciation or devaluation;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory Russian laws and\nregulations on the conduct of\nits business; sanctions or\nasset freezes; or other\ndeconsolidation events (see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d\nabove).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Citi\ncontinued to consolidate AO\nCitibank because none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered. Examples of factors\nthat may result in\ndeconsolidation of AO Citibank\ninclude voluntary or forced\nsale of ownership or loss of\ncontrol due to actions of\nrelevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank, Citi would be\nrequired to (i) write off the\nnet investment of less than\n$0.1 billion (compared to $0.2\nbillion as of September 30,\n2024), (ii) recognize a CTA\nloss of approximately $1.6\nbillion (unchanged from\nSeptember 30, 2024) through\nearnings and (iii) recognize a\nloss of $0.9 billion (a $0.2\nbillion increase from\nSeptember 30, 2024) on\nintercompany liabilities owed\nby AO Citibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve. The $1.6 billion CTA\nwrite-off through earnings\nunder either event is expected\nto be largely equity neutral,\nsince the reversal of the CTA\nloss out of AOCI would improve\nCiti\u2019s total AOCI .\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients               \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose\n                              124                               \nto Citi the presence of\nsanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or block\nthe funds until applicable\nsanctions are lifted or the\npayments are otherwise\nauthorized under applicable\nlaw.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its employees,\nclients, customers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its remaining\npresence in Russia and\nassociation with Russian\nindividuals or entities,\nwhether subject to sanctions\nor not, including Citi\u2019s\ninability to support its\nglobal clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations. For\nadditional information on\noperational and cyber risks,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisks\u201d above.\n\nBoard of Directors\u2019 Role in\nOverseeing Related Risks\n\nThe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors (Board) and the\nBoard\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee (RMC) and its other\nCommittees receive regular\nreports from senior management\nregarding global geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic and reputational\nimpacts to Citi (including the\nwar in Ukraine and its impact\non Citi\u2019s operations in Russia\nand Ukraine).

Citi\nemploys approximately 220\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. As of\nDecember 31, 2024, Citi had\n$1.7 billion of direct\nexposures related to Ukraine\n(an increase of $0.2 billion\nfrom September 30, 2024).\n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough Services , Markets and\nBanking . As of December 31,\n2024, Citi\u2019s net investment in\nits Argentine operations was\napproximately $1.5 billion\n(compared to $1.3 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024). Citi uses\nthe U.S. dollar (USD) as the\nfunctional currency for its\noperations in countries such\nas Argentina that are deemed\nhighly inflationary in\naccordance with GAAP. Citi\ntherefore records the impact\nof exchange rate fluctuations\non its net Argentine peso\n(ARS)\u2013denominated assets\ndirectly in earnings. Citi\nuses Argentina\u2019s official\nmarket exchange rate to\nremeasure its net ARS-\ndenominated assets into USD.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the\nofficial ARS exchange rate was\n1,032, which devalued by 6.3%\nagainst the USD during the\nfourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe increase in Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Argentina in the\nfourth quarter of 2024 was\nlargely due to earnings from\nCiti\u2019s normal onshore\noperations and a reserve\nrelease, driven by a decrease\nin transfer risk for safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law. The\nincrease was partially offset\nby FX translation losses on\nthe net investment.\n\nThe Central Bank of Argentina\n(BCRA) continues to maintain\ncertain capital and currency\ncontrols that generally\nrestrict Citi\u2019s ability to\naccess USD in Argentina and\nremit earnings from its\nArgentine operations. The\ncapital and currency controls\nhave resulted in indirect\nforeign exchange mechanisms\nthat some Argentine entities\nmay use to obtain USD,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\ngenerally precluded from\naccessing these alternative\nmechanisms, and under U.S.\nGAAP, these exchange\nmechanisms cannot be used to\nremeasure Citi\u2019s net monetary\nassets into USD. If\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate further converges with\nthe approximate rate implied\nby the indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms, Citi\ncould incur additional\ntranslation losses on its net\ninvestment in Argentina.\nAccordingly, Citi seeks to\nreduce its overall ARS\nexposure in\n                              125                               \nArgentina while complying with\nlocal capital and currency\nexposure limitations.\n\nOf the $1.5 billion net\ninvestment in Argentina as of\nDecember 31, 2024, Citi\u2019s net\nARS exposure was approximately\n$1.1 billion (compared to $0.9\nbillion as of September 30,\n2024). Citi\u2019s net ARS exposure\nis less than its total net\ninvestment in Argentina as a\nresult of Citi holding\napproximately $175 million of\nUSD-denominated loans as well\nas approximately $200 million\nof certain local government\nbonds that are USD\ndenominated. If Citi had not\ninvested in such instruments\nto reduce its ARS exposure,\nCiti would have recognized\nadditional translation losses\nduring the fourth quarter of\n2024. Given current economic\nconditions and the local\ncapital, currency and\nregulatory limitations, Citi\ncannot guarantee the\navailability or effectiveness\nof such mechanisms to reduce\nits ARS exposure in the\nfuture.\n\nIn addition to reducing the\nARS exposure, Citi also seeks\nto economically hedge the\nexposure to the extent\npossible and prudent using\nnon-deliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of December\n31, 2024, Citi hedged\napproximately $0.4 billion of\nits ARS exposure through\noffshore hedges, including NDF\nderivative instruments. Citi\nwas unable to hedge its\nremaining ARS exposure, given\nthe illiquidity of the\noffshore NDF market. To the\nextent that Citi is unable to\nexecute or renew NDF contracts\nin the future, Citi would\nrecord devaluations on its net\nARS-denominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of such derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposure. Citi\ncannot predict the\navailability of hedging\ninstruments in the future nor\ncan it predict changes in\nforeign exchange rates and the\nresulting impact on earnings.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished an appropriate ACL\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of December\n31, 2024.

As an example, because\ntotal outstandings under FFIEC\nguidelines do not include the\nbenefit of margin or hedges,\nmarket volatility in interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates\nand credit spreads may cause\nsignificant fluctuations in\nthe level of total\noutstandings, all else being\nequal.\n                              126                               \nThe tables below present each country whose total outstandings\nexceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) Non-bank financial institutions.\n\n(2) Included in total outstanding.\n\n(3) Total outstanding includes cross-border claims on third\nparties, as well as local country assets.

Note 1 contains a\nsummary of all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. These policies, as\nwell as estimates made by\nmanagement, are integral to\nthe presentation of Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition. While all\nof these policies require a\ncertain level of management\njudgment and estimates, this\nsection highlights and\ndiscusses the significant\naccounting policies that\nrequire management to make\nhighly difficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A portion of\nthese assets and liabilities\nis reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet as Trading account\nassets , Available-for-sale\nsecurities and Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\ndrivers to the valuation of an\ninstrument and the degree of\nilliquidity and subsequent\nlack of observability in\ncertain markets. The fair\nvalue of these instruments is\nreported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nwith the changes in fair value\nrecognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses, and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 1, 6, 26 and 27.\n                              128                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below presents\nCiti\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\ntotal ACL as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023, as well as\nbuilds and releases during\n2024.

The ACL on\nOther assets includes ACL\nrelated to transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S., driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law.\n\nCiti\u2019s reserves for expected\ncredit losses on funded loans\nand for unfunded lending\ncommitments, standby letters\nof credit and financial\nguarantees are reflected on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet\nin the Allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\nOther liabilities (for\nAllowance for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC)), respectively. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables are reflected in\nOther assets . These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each\n\nreporting period. Citi\u2019s\nability to estimate expected\ncredit losses over the\nreasonable and supportable\n(R&S) period is based on the\nability to forecast economic\nactivity over a R&S timeframe.\nThe R&S forecast period for\nall loans is eight quarters.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects risks and\ncertain economic conditions\nnot fully captured in the\nquantitative component. Both\nthe quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                              129                               \nQuantitative Component Citi\nestimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions. For its consumer\nand corporate portfolios,\nCiti\u2019s expected credit losses\nare determined primarily by\nutilizing models that consider\nthe borrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables, including housing\nprices, unemployment rate and\nreal GDP, and cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry,\nproduct and business segments.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well\nas other credit trends.\nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes\nrisks that are not fully\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent. These may include\nbut are not limited to\nportfolio characteristics,\nidiosyncratic events, factors\nnot within historical loss\ndata or the economic forecast,\nuncertainty in the credit\nenvironment and other factors\nas required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The primary examples of\nthese are the following: \u2022\nTransfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S.,\ndriven by safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law \u2022 Potential\nimpacts on vulnerable\nindustries and regions due to\nemerging macroeconomic risks\nand uncertainties, including\nthose related to potential\nglobal recession, inflation,\ninterest rates, commodity\nprices and geopolitical\ntensions \u2022 Risk associated\nwith consumer payment behavior\ngiven the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment As of the fourth\nquarter of 2024, Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the\nACL decreased quarter-over-\nquarter. The decrease was\ndriven by factors such as a\nrelease related to reserves\nfor specific risks and\nuncertainties impacting\nvulnerable industries and\nregions. Macroeconomic\nVariables As further discussed\nbelow, Citi considers various\nglobal macroeconomic variables\nfor the base, upside and\ndownside probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe quantitative component of\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the macroeconomic\nvariables that most\nsignificantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL.\n\nThe tables below present\nCiti\u2019s forecasted quarterly\naverage U.S. unemployment rate\nand year-over-year U.S. real\nGDP growth rate used in\ndetermining the base\nmacroeconomic forecast for\nCiti\u2019s ACL at each quarterly\nreporting period from 4Q23 to\n4Q24:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            1Q25       3Q25       1Q26       8-quart\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.3  %     4.2  %     4.2  %         4.2  %  \n  at 4Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.1        4.1        3.9            4.0     \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.1        4.1        3.9            4.1     \n  at 2Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.4        4.4        3.9            4.2     \n  at 3Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.2        4.3        4.1            4.2     \n  at 4Q24                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking eight\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. real GDP                  2024       2025       2026     \n  Citi forecast                   1.4  %     1.7  %     2.1  %  \n  at 4Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.3        1.8        2.0     \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.4        1.8        2.0     \n  at 2Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.6        1.8        2.0     \n  at 3Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.7        2.2        2.1     \n  at 4Q24                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level. Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof the fourth quarter of 2024,\nU.S. real GDP growth is\nexpected to slow during 2025\nand 2026, while the\nunemployment rate is expected\nto increase in 2025, but\ndecline in 2026. Scenario\nWeighting Citi\u2019s ACL is\nestimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario. For example,\ncompared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nreflects a recession,\nincluding an elevated average\nU.S. unemployment rate of 6.8%\nover the eight-quarter R&S\nperiod, with a peak difference\nof 3.4% in the second quarter\nof 2026. The downside scenario\nalso reflects a year-over-year\nU.S. real GDP contraction in\n2025 of 1.8%, with a peak\nquarter-over-quarter\ndifference to the base\nscenario of 1.3%. Citi\u2019s ACL\nis sensitive to the various\nmacroeconomic scenarios that\ndrive the quantitative\ncomponent of expected credit\nlosses, due to changes in the\nlength and severity of\nforecasted economic variables\nor events in the respective\nscenarios. Citi\u2019s downside\nscenario incorporates more\nadverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the weighted\nscenario assumptions. To\ndemonstrate this sensitivity,\nif Citi applied\n                              130                               \n100% weight to the downside\nscenario as of December 31,\n2024 to reflect the most\nsevere economic deterioration\nforecast in the macroeconomic\nscenarios, there would have\nbeen a hypothetical\nincremental increase in the\nACL of approximately $5.3\nbillion related to lending\nexposures, except for loans\nindividually evaluated for\ncredit losses and other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost.\n\nThis analysis does not\nincorporate any impacts or\nchanges to the qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL. These\nfactors could change the\noutcome of the sensitivity\nanalysis based on historical\nexperience and current\nconditions at the time of the\nassessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of December 31,\n2024.\n\n4Q24 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for\nthe fourth quarter of 2024 was\n$22.2 billion, a slight\nincrease from September 30,\n2024. The net build of $0.3\nbillion in the quarter was\nprimarily driven by growth in\ncards balances in USPB . Citi\nbelieves its analysis of the\nACL reflects the forward view\nof the economic environment as\nof December 31, 2024. See Note\n16 for additional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. cards\n(Branded Cards and Retail\nServices) in USPB . Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACLL build was\n$0.3 billion in the fourth\nquarter of 2024, primarily\ndriven by growth in U.S. cards\nbalances. This resulted in a\nDecember 31, 2024 ACLL balance\nof $16.0 billion, or 4.08% of\ntotal funded consumer loans.\n\nFor U.S. cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans decreased to\n7.93% at December 31, 2024,\ndue to seasonal improvement,\ncompared to 8.15% at September\n30, 2024. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to total\nfunded loans was 1.11% at\nDecember 31, 2024, compared to\n1.08% at September 30, 2024.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nrelease of less than $0.1\nbillion in the fourth quarter\nof 2024, largely driven by a\nrelease for specific risks and\nuncertainties impacting\nvulnerable industries and\nregions in Banking and lower\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S.,\ndriven by safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law in Services ,\npartially offset by a build\nfor changes in portfolio\ncomposition in Markets .

These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsustained decrease in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s activities were\nconducted through the\nreportable operating segments:\nServices , Markets , Banking ,\nWealth and USPB , with the\nremaining operations recorded\nin All Other , which includes\nactivities not assigned to a\nspecific operating segment as\nwell as discontinued\noperations. Goodwill\nimpairment testing is\nperformed at the level below\nthe operating segment\n(referred to as a reporting\nunit).\n\nCiti performed its annual\ngoodwill impairment test,\nwhich resulted in no\nimpairment of any of Citi\u2019s\nreporting units\u2019 goodwill. No\nadditional triggering events\nwere identified and no\ngoodwill was impaired during\n2024. For each of the\nCompany\u2019s reporting units,\nfair value exceeded carrying\nvalue by at least 10%.\n\nCiti utilizes allocated\ntangible common equity as a\nproxy for the carrying value\nof its reporting units for\npurposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. The\nallocated equity in the\nreporting units is determined\nbased on the capital the\nbusiness would require if it\nwere operating as a standalone\nentity, incorporating\nsufficient capital to be in\ncompliance with both current\nand expected regulatory\ncapital requirements,\nincluding capital for\nspecifically identified\ngoodwill and intangible\nassets. The capital allocated\nto the reporting units is\nincorporated into the annual\nbudget process, which is\napproved by Citigroup\u2019s Board\nof Directors.\n                              131                               \nGoodwill impairment testing\ninvolves management judgment,\nrequiring an assessment of\nwhether the carrying value of\na reporting unit can be\nsupported by its fair value\nusing widely accepted\nvaluation techniques, such as\nthe market approach (earnings\nmultiples and/or transaction\nmultiples) and/or the income\napproach (discounted cash flow\n(DCF) method). In applying\nthese methodologies, Citi\nutilizes a number of factors,\nincluding actual operating\nresults, future business\nplans, economic projections\nand market data.\n\nCiti engaged an independent\nvaluation specialist to assist\nin Citi\u2019s valuation of all the\nreporting units, primarily\nemploying both the income and\nmarket approach to determine\nthe fair value of the\nreporting units. The income\napproach utilized discount\nrates that Citi believes\nadequately reflected the risk\nand uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in the\ninternally generated cash flow\nprojections. The market\napproach utilizes observable\nmarket data from comparable\npublicly traded companies,\nsuch as price-to-earnings or\nprice-to-tangible book value\nratios, to estimate a\nreporting unit\u2019s fair value.\nManagement uses judgment in\nthe selection of comparable\ncompanies and includes those\nwith the most similar business\nactivities.\n\nThe income approach employs a\ncapital asset pricing model in\nestimating the discount rate.\nSince none of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units are publicly\ntraded, individual reporting\nunit fair value determinations\ncannot be directly correlated\nto Citigroup\u2019s common stock\nprice. The sum of the fair\nvalues of the reporting units\nexceeded the overall market\ncapitalization of Citi as of\nOctober 1, 2024. However, Citi\nbelieves that it is not\nmeaningful to reconcile the\nsum of the fair values of the\nCompany\u2019s reporting units to\nits market capitalization due\nto several factors. The market\ncapitalization of Citigroup\nreflects the execution risk in\na transaction involving\nCitigroup due to its size.\nHowever, the individual\nreporting units\u2019 fair values\nare not subject to the same\nlevel of execution risk or a\nbusiness model that is as\nglobal. In addition, the\nmarket capitalization of\nCitigroup does not include\nconsideration of the\nindividual reporting unit\u2019s\ncontrol premium.\n\nUnanticipated declines in\nbusiness performance,\nincreases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital\nrequirements and adverse\nregulatory or legislative\nchanges, as well as\ndeterioration in economic or\nmarket conditions, are factors\nthat could result in a\nmaterial impairment loss to\nearnings in a future period\nrelated to some portion of the\nassociated goodwill.

These tax\nlaws are complex and are\nsubject to differing\ninterpretations by the\ntaxpayer and the relevant\ngovernmental taxing\nauthorities. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax\nlaws may be subject to review\nand adjudication by the court\nsystems of the various tax\njurisdictions or may be\nsettled with the taxing\nauthority upon audit.\n\nIn establishing a provision\nfor income tax expense, Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these\ninherently complex tax laws.\nCiti must also make estimates\nabout when in the future\ncertain items will affect\ntaxable income in the various\ntax jurisdictions, both\ndomestic and foreign. Deferred\ntaxes are recorded for the\nfuture consequences of events\nthat have been recognized in\nthe financial statements or\ntax returns, based on enacted\ntax laws and rates. Deferred\ntax assets (DTAs) are\nrecognized subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment that\nrealization is more-likely-\nthan-not. For example, if it\nis more-likely-than-not that a\ncarry-forward would expire\nunused, Citi would set up a\nvaluation allowance against\nthat DTA. Citi has established\nvaluation allowances as\ndescribed below.\n\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act (Tax Reform),\nbeginning in 2018, Citi is\ntaxed on income generated by\nits U.S. operations at a\nfederal tax rate of 21%. The\neffect on Citi\u2019s state tax\nrate is dependent upon how and\nwhen the individual states\nthat have not yet addressed\nthe federal tax law changes\nchoose to adopt the various\nnew provisions of the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code.\n\nCiti\u2019s non-U.S. branches and\nsubsidiaries are subject to\ntax at their local tax rates.\nNon-U.S. branches also\ncontinue to be subject to U.S.\ntaxation. The impact of this\non Citi\u2019s earnings depends on\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate, and allocations of\noverall domestic loss (ODL)\nand expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to branch earnings.\nCiti expects no residual U.S.\ntax on such earnings. With\nrespect to non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries, dividends from\nthese subsidiaries will be\nexcluded from U.S. taxation.\nWhile the majority of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. subsidiary earnings\nare classified as global\nintangible low-taxed income\n(GILTI), Citi expects no\nmaterial residual U.S. tax on\nsuch earnings based on its\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 local\ntax rates, which exceed, on\naverage, the effective 13.125%\nGILTI tax rate. Finally, Citi\ndoes not expect the base\nerosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT)\nto affect its tax provision.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, final FTC\nregulations were published in\nthe Federal Register, which\neliminate the creditability of\nforeign taxes paid in certain\nsituations. These include\ncountries that do not align\nwith U.S. tax principles in\nsignificant part and for\nservices performed outside the\nrecipient country. In 2023,\nthe IRS announced that the\neffective date of these\nregulations was deferred until\nthe IRS gives notice\notherwise. The impact on\nCiti\u2019s effective tax rate is\nnot expected to be material.\n                              132                               \nThe Inflation Reduction Act\nwas signed into law on August\n16, 2022. The Act includes a\nnew corporate alternative\nminimum tax (AMT) and a 1%\nexcise tax on share\nrepurchases, both effective\nJanuary 1, 2023. The corporate\nAMT is a 15% minimum tax on\nfinancial statement income\nafter adjusting for foreign\ntaxes paid. Corporate AMT paid\nin one year is creditable\nagainst regular corporate tax\nliability in future years.\nCiti does not expect to pay\nmaterial amounts of corporate\nAMT given its profitability\nand tax profile.\n\nThe 1% excise tax is a non-\ndeductible tax on the fair\nmarket value of stock\nrepurchased in the taxable\nyear, reduced by the fair\nmarket value of any stock\nissued in the same year. See\nNote 11 for the 2024 impact on\nearnings per share related to\nthe excise tax.\n                                                                \n  Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances (VA)             \n                                                                \nAt December 31, 2024, Citi had\nnet DTAs of $29.8 billion. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2024,\nCiti\u2019s DTAs decreased by $0.2\nbillion, primarily as a result\nof the geographic mix of\nearnings. On a full-year\nbasis, Citi\u2019s DTAs increased\nby $0.2 billion from $29.6\nbillion at December 31, 2023.\n\nOf Citi\u2019s total net DTAs of\n$29.8 billion as of December\n31, 2024, $12.8 billion,\nprimarily related to tax\ncarry-forwards, was deducted\nin calculating Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. Net DTAs\narising from temporary\ndifferences are also deducted\nfrom regulatory capital if in\nexcess of the 10%/15%\nlimitations (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d above). For the\nquarter and year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, Citi had\n$3.0 billion of disallowed\ntemporary difference DTAs\n(included in the $12.8 billion\nabove). The remaining $17.0\nbillion of net DTAs as of\nDecember 31, 2024 was not\ndeducted in calculating\nregulatory capital pursuant to\nBasel III standards and was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder those rules.\n\nCiti\u2019s total VA at December\n31, 2024 was $4.3 billion, an\nincrease of $0.7 billion from\n$3.6 billion at December 31,\n2023. The increase was\nprimarily driven by the\ngeneration of current-year\nFTCs in the branch basket.\nCiti\u2019s VA of $4.3 billion is\ncomposed of $3.3 billion on\nits FTC branch basket carry-\nforwards, $0.6 billion on its\nU.S. residual DTA related to\nits non-U.S. branches, $0.3\nbillion on local non-U.S. DTAs\nand $0.1 billion on state net\noperating loss carry-forwards.\n\nAs stated above with regard to\nthe impact of non-U.S.\n\nbranches on Citi\u2019s earnings,\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate and the allocations of\nODL and expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to the branch basket\nare the\n\nmain factors in determining\nthe branch VA. Additional ODL\n\nwas created in 2024 as a\nresult of reduced taxable\nincome.\n\nRecognized FTC carry-forwards\nin the general basket\ncomprised approximately $0.7\nbillion of Citi\u2019s DTAs as of\nDecember 31, 2024, compared to\napproximately $1.2 billion as\nof December 31, 2023. The\ndecrease in FTCs year-over-\nyear was primarily due to\ncurrent-year usage. The FTC\ncarry-forward period\nrepresents the most time-\nsensitive component of Citi\u2019s\nDTAs.\n\nCiti had an ODL of\napproximately $9 billion at\nDecember 31, 2024, which\nallows Citi to elect a\npercentage between 50% and\n100% of future years\u2019 domestic\nsource income to be\nreclassified as foreign source\nincome. (See Note 10 for a\ndescription of the ODL.)\n\nThe majority of Citi\u2019s U.S.\nfederal net operating loss\ncarry-forward and all of its\nNew York State and City net\noperating loss carry-forwards\nare subject to a carry-forward\nperiod of 20 years. This\nprovides enough time to fully\nutilize the net DTAs\npertaining to these existing\nnet operating loss carry-\nforwards. This is due to\nCiti\u2019s forecast of sufficient\nU.S. taxable income and the\ncontinued taxation of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income by New York\nState and City.\n\nAlthough realization is not\nassured, Citi believes that\nthe realization of its\nrecognized net DTAs of $29.8\nbillion at December 31, 2024\nis more-likely-than-not, based\non management\u2019s expectations\nas to future taxable income in\nthe jurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\navailable tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC\nTopic 740, Income Taxes ).\nCiti has concluded that it has\nthe necessary positive\nevidence to support the\nrealization of its net DTAs\nafter taking its VAs into\nconsideration.\n\nSee Note 10 for additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s income\ntaxes, including its income\ntax provision, tax assets and\nliabilities and a tabular\nsummary of Citi\u2019s net DTAs\nbalance as of December 31,\n2024 (including the FTCs and\napplicable expiration dates of\nthe FTCs).

Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting is\ndesigned to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the\nreliability of its financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal reporting purposes in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that\n(i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that in reasonable\ndetail accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of Citi\u2019s assets,\n(ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of\nfinancial statements in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles\nand that Citi\u2019s receipts and\nexpenditures are made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof Citi\u2019s management and\ndirectors, and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse or disposition of Citi\u2019s\nassets that could have a\nmaterial effect on its\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect all\nmisstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nCiti\u2019s management assessed the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2024 based on the\ncriteria set forth by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework\n(2013) . Based on this\nassessment, management has\nconcluded that, as of December\n31, 2024, Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was effective. In\naddition, there were no\nchanges in Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting during the fiscal\nquarter ended December 31,\n2024 that materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n\nThe effectiveness of Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2024 has been\naudited by KPMG LLP, Citi\u2019s\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in\ntheir report below, which\nexpressed an unqualified\nopinion on the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2024.\n                              134                               \n                                                                \n  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                    \n                                                                \nCertain statements in this\nreport, including but not\nlimited to statements included\nwithin the Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and\nResults of Operations, are\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995. In\naddition, Citigroup may make\nforward-looking statements in\nits other documents filed or\nfurnished with the SEC, and\nits management may make\nforward-looking statements\norally to analysts, investors,\nrepresentatives of the media\nand others.\n\nGenerally, forward-looking\nstatements are not based on\nhistorical facts but instead\nrepresent Citigroup\u2019s and its\nmanagement\u2019s beliefs regarding\nfuture events. Such statements\nmay be identified by words\nsuch as believe, expect,\nanticipate, intend, estimate,\nmay increase, may fluctuate,\ntarget, outlook, guidance and\nillustrative, and similar\nexpressions or future or\nconditional verbs such as\nwill, should, would and could.\n\nSuch statements are based on\nmanagement\u2019s current\nexpectations and are subject\nto risks, uncertainties and\nchanges in circumstances.\nActual results of operations\nand financial conditions,\nincluding capital and\nliquidity, may differ\nmaterially from those included\nin these statements due to a\nvariety of factors, including\nwithout limitation (i) the\nprecautionary statements\nincluded within the \u201cExecutive\nSummary,\u201d \u201cCiti\u2019s Multiyear\nTransformation\u201d and each\nbusiness\u2019s discussion and\nanalysis of its results of\noperations and (ii) the\nfactors listed and described\nunder \u201cRisk Factors\u201d above.\n\nAny forward-looking statements\nmade by or on behalf of\nCitigroup speak only as to the\ndate they are made, and Citi\ndoes not undertake to update\nforward-looking statements to\nreflect the impact of\ncircumstances or events that\narise after the date that the\nforward-looking statements\nwere made.\n                              135                               \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT\nREGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING\nFIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board\nof Directors\n\nCitigroup Inc.:\n\nOpinions on the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the\naccompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of Citigroup\nInc. and subsidiaries (the\nCompany) as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023, the related\nconsolidated statements of\nincome, comprehensive income,\nchanges in stockholders\u2019\nequity, and cash flows for\neach of the years in the\nthree-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2024, and the\nrelated notes (collectively,\nthe consolidated financial\nstatements). We also have\naudited the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nIn our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements referred to above\npresent fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the\nfinancial position of the\nCompany as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023, and the results\nof its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the years in\nthe three-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2024, in\nconformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Also in our\nopinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2024 based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is\nresponsible for these\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, for maintaining\neffective internal control\nover financial reporting, and\nfor its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting, included in the\naccompanying management\u2019s\nannual report on internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on\nthe Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and an\nopinion on the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting based on\nour audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in\naccordance with the standards\nof the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free\nof material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud,\nand whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was maintained in\nall material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included\nperforming procedures to\nassess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as\nevaluating the overall\npresentation of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audit of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing\nthe risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other\nprocedures as we considered\nnecessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that\nour audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our\nopinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting is a\nprocess designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal purposes in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that,\nin reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit\npreparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of\nthe company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters\ncommunicated below are matters\narising from the current\nperiod audit of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements and (2) involved\nour especially\n                              136                               \nchallenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical\naudit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical\naudit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\n\nAssessment of the fair value\nof certain Level 3 assets and\nliabilities measured on a\nrecurring basis\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 26\nto the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Company\u2019s\nassets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis were $834,645\nmillion, net and $317,033\nmillion, net, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2024. The Company\nestimated the fair value of\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities\nmeasured on a recurring basis\n($9,194 million and $28,755\nmillion, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2024) utilizing\nvarious valuation techniques\nwith one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers being unobservable\nincluding, but not limited to,\ncomplex internal valuation\nmodels, alternative pricing\nprocedures or comparables\nanalysis and discounted cash\nflows.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the measurement of fair\nvalue for certain Level 3\nassets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as a critical\naudit matter. A high degree of\neffort, including specialized\nskills and knowledge, and\nsubjective and complex auditor\njudgment was involved in the\nassessment of the Level 3 fair\nvalues due to measurement\nuncertainty. Specifically, the\nassessment encompassed the\nevaluation of the fair value\nmethodology, including\nmethods, models and\nsignificant assumptions used\nto estimate fair value.\nSignificant assumptions\ninclude the use of proxy\ninformation, the extrapolation\nand interpolation of proxy\ninformation, and the use of\nhistoric pricing information\nas well as certain model\nassumptions. The assessment\nalso included an evaluation of\nthe conceptual soundness and\nperformance of the valuation\nmodels.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We involved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in evaluating the\ndesign and testing the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s Level\n3 fair value measurements\nincluding controls over:\n\n\u2022 valuation methodologies,\nincluding significant\nassumptions\n\n\u2022 independent price\nverification\n\n\u2022 evaluating that significant\nmodel assumptions reflected\nthose which a market\nparticipant would use to\ndetermine an exit price in the\ncurrent market environment\n\n\u2022 the valuation models used\nwere mathematically accurate\nand appropriate to value the\nfinancial instruments and\n\n\u2022 relevant information used\nwithin the Company\u2019s models\nthat was reasonably available\nwas considered in the fair\nvalue determination.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nmethodology for compliance\nwith U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. We\ninvolved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in developing an\nindependent fair value\nestimate for a selection of\ncertain Level 3 assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis\nbased on independently\ndeveloped valuation models and\nassumptions, as applicable,\nusing market data sources we\ndetermined to be relevant and\nreliable and compared our\nindependent expectation to the\nCompany\u2019s fair value\nmeasurements.\n\nAssessment of the allowance\nfor credit losses collectively\nevaluated for impairment\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 16\nto the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Company\u2019s\ntotal allowance for credit\nlosses on loans, leases and\nunfunded lending commitments\nwas $20,175 million as of\nDecember 31, 2024, which\nincludes the allowance related\nto loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments collectively\nevaluated for impairment (the\ncollective ACLL). The expected\ncredit losses for the\nquantitative component of the\ncollective ACLL is the product\nof multiplying the probability\nof default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD), and exposure at\ndefault (EAD), which are\ndetermined utilizing models,\nfor consumer and corporate\nloans. The PD, LGD, and EAD\nassumptions are determined\nbased on three macroeconomic\nscenarios (base, downside and\nupside) multiplied by their\nrespective scenario weights.\nThe macroeconomic scenario\nweights are estimated based on\na statistical model, which\ntakes into consideration both\ninternal and external\nforecasted macroeconomic\nvariables over a reasonable\nand supportable period, after\nwhich mean reversion\nreflecting historical loss\nexperience is used for the\nremaining life of the loan to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses. The qualitative\ncomponent considers, among\nother things, certain\nportfolio characteristics and\nidiosyncratic events. For\nconsumer U.S. credit cards,\nthe Company utilizes the\npayment rate approach to\ndetermine the payments needed\nto pay off the end-of-period\nbalance in the estimation of\nthe EAD. This approach\nincorporates payment rate\ncurves and is used to estimate\nEAD. Reserves for\nunconditionally cancelable\naccounts are based on the\nexpected life of the balance\nas of the evaluation date and\ndo not include undrawn\ncommitments that are\nunconditionally cancelable. In\naddition, the models for the\ndelinquency-managed portfolios\ntake into account leading\ncredit indicators, including\nloan delinquencies and changes\nin portfolio size as well as\neconomic trends, including\ncurrent and future housing\nprices, unemployment, length\nof time in foreclosure, and\ncosts to sell. The models for\nclassifiably managed\nportfolios consider the credit\nquality as measured by risk\nratings and economic factors.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the collective ACLL,\nspecifically the quantitative\ncomponent for the consumer\nU.S. credit cards which\napplies the delinquency-\nmanaged model and corporate\nloan portfolios which applies\nthe classifiably managed\nmodel, and the qualitative\ncomponent for the corporate\nportfolio as a critical audit\n                              137                               \nmatter. A high degree of\neffort, including specialized\nskills and knowledge, and\nsubjective and complex auditor\njudgment was involved in the\nassessment due to significant\nmeasurement uncertainty.\nSpecifically, the assessment\nencompassed the evaluation of\nthe various components of the\ncollective ACLL methodology,\nincluding the methods and\nmodels used to estimate the\nPD, LGD, and EAD and certain\nsignificant assumptions for\nthe Company\u2019s quantitative and\nqualitative components. The\nsignificant assumptions for\nconsumer U.S. credit card\nloans encompass expected life\nas well as the reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts for\nsignificant macroeconomic\nvariables. The significant\nmacroeconomic variables\ninclude U.S. unemployment\n(UER) and U.S. housing prices\n(HPI), which are utilized by\nthe models. The significant\nassumptions for corporate\nloans encompass risk ratings,\ncredit conversion factor for\nunfunded lending commitments,\nand reasonable and supportable\nforecast for significant\nmacroeconomic variables. The\nsignificant macroeconomic\nvariables include U.S. real\ngross domestic product (GDP)\nand UER, which are utilized by\nthe model. The significant\nassumptions for the\nqualitative component for\ncorporate loan portfolios\ninclude potential impacts on\nvulnerable industries and\nregions due to emerging\nmacroeconomic risks and\nuncertainty including those\nrelated to potential global\nrecession, inflation, interest\nrates, commodity prices, and\ngeopolitical tensions. The\nassessment also included an\nevaluation of the conceptual\nsoundness and performance of\nthe PD, LGD, and EAD models.\nIn addition, auditor judgment\nwas required to evaluate the\nsufficiency of audit evidence\nobtained.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s\nmeasurement of the collective\nACLL estimate, including\ncontrols over the:\n\n\u2022 approval of the collective\nACLL methodologies, including\nthe PD, LGD, and EAD\n\n\u2022 determination of the\nsignificant assumptions used\nto estimate the quantitative\nand qualitative components of\nthe collective ACLL\n\n\u2022 performance monitoring of\nthe PD, LGD, and EAD models.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nprocess to develop the\ncollective ACLL estimate by\ntesting certain sources of\ndata and assumptions that the\nCompany used and considered\nthe relevance and reliability\nof such data and assumptions.\nIn addition, we involved\ncredit risk professionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n\n\u2022 evaluating the Company\u2019s\ncollective ACLL methodologies\nfor compliance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples\n\n\u2022 continued assessment of the\nconceptual soundness and\nperformance testing of the PD,\nLGD, and EAD models by\ninspecting the model\ndocumentation to determine\nwhether the models are\nsuitable for their intended\nuse\n\n\u2022 evaluating judgments made by\nthe Company relative to the\nperformance monitoring testing\nof the PD, LGD, and EAD models\nby comparing them to relevant\nCompany-specific metrics\n\n\u2022 assessing the macroeconomic\nforecast scenarios through\ncomparison to publicly\navailable forecasts\n\n\u2022 testing corporate loan risk\nratings for a selection of\nborrowers by evaluating the\nfinancial performance of the\nborrower, sources of\nrepayment, and any relevant\nguarantees or underlying\ncollateral\n\n\u2022 evaluating the methodologies\nused to develop the\nqualitative component and\ntheir significant assumptions\nand the effect of that\ncomponent on the collective\nACLL compared with relevant\ncredit risk factors and\nconsistency with credit\ntrends.\n\nWe also assessed the\nsufficiency of the audit\nevidence obtained related to\nthe collective ACLL by\nevaluating the:\n\n\u2022 cumulative results of the\naudit procedures\n\n\u2022 qualitative aspects of the\nCompany\u2019s accounting practices\n\n\u2022 potential bias in the\naccounting estimates.\n\n/s/ KPMG

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                 \n                                                                \nThroughout these Notes, \u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d\nrefer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nCertain reclassifications and updates have been made to the\nprior periods\u2019 financial statements and notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation. Principles of Consolidation The\nConsolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nCitigroup and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company\nconsolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or\nindirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where it\nexercises control. Entities in which the Company holds 20% to\n50% of the voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence, other than investments of designated\nventure capital subsidiaries or investments accounted for at\nfair value under the fair value option, are accounted for under\nthe equity method, and the pro rata share of their income (loss)\nis included in Other revenue . Income from investments in less-\nthan-20%-owned companies is recognized when dividends are\nreceived. As discussed in more detail in Note 23, Citigroup also\nconsolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities\nwhen Citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary.\nGains and losses on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries,\naffiliates, buildings and other investments are included in\nOther revenue . Citibank Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) is a\ncommercial bank and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of\nCitigroup. Citibank\u2019s principal offerings include investment\nbanking, commercial banking, cash management, trade finance and\ne-commerce; private banking products and services; consumer\nfinance, credit cards and mortgage lending; and retail banking\nproducts and services. Uses of Special Purpose Entities A\nspecial purpose entity (SPE) is an entity designed to fulfill a\nspecific limited need of the company that organized it. The\nprincipal uses of SPEs by Citi are to assist clients in\nsecuritizing their financial assets and create investment\nproducts for clients and to obtain liquidity and optimize\ncapital efficiency by securitizing certain of Citi\u2019s financial\nassets. SPEs may be organized in various legal forms, including\ntrusts, partnerships or corporations. In a securitization,\nthrough the SPE\u2019s issuance of debt and equity instruments,\ncertificates, commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness,\nthe company transferring assets to the SPE converts all (or a\nportion) of those assets into cash before they would have been\nrealized in the normal course of business. These issuances are\nrecorded on the balance sheet of the SPE, which may or may not\nbe consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that\norganized the SPE.\n\nInvestors usually have recourse only to the assets in the SPE,\nbut may also benefit from other credit enhancements, such as a\ncollateral account, a line of credit or a liquidity facility,\nsuch as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement.\nBecause of these enhancements, the SPE issuances typically\nobtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could\nobtain for its own debt issuances. This results in less\nexpensive financing costs than unsecured debt. The SPE may also\nenter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or\ncurrency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE\ninvestors or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE.\nCitigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as\nwell as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts.\nMost of Citigroup\u2019s SPEs are variable interest entities (VIEs).\nVariable Interest Entities An entity is a variable interest\nentity (VIE) if it meets either of the criteria outlined in\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation\n, which are (i) the entity has equity that is insufficient to\npermit the entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other parties, or (ii) the\nentity has equity investors that cannot make significant\ndecisions about the entity\u2019s operations or that do not absorb\ntheir proportionate share of the entity\u2019s expected losses or\nexpected returns. Investors that finance the VIE through debt or\nequity interests or other counterparties providing other forms\nof support, such as guarantees, certain fee arrangements or\ncertain types of derivative contracts, are variable interest\nholders in the entity. The variable interest holder, if any,\nthat has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to\nbe the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. The\nCompany must evaluate each VIE to understand the purpose and\ndesign of the entity, the role the Company had in the entity's\ndesign and its involvement in the VIE\u2019s ongoing activities. The\nCompany then must evaluate which activities most significantly\nimpact the economic performance of the VIE and who has the power\nto direct such activities. For those VIEs where the Company\ndetermines that it has the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, the\nCompany must then evaluate its economic interests, if any, and\ndetermine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits\nthat could potentially be significant to the VIE. When\nevaluating whether the Company has an obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant, it considers the\nmaximum exposure to such loss without consideration of\nprobability. Such obligations could be in various forms,\nincluding, but not limited to, debt and equity investments,\nguarantees, liquidity agreements and certain derivative\ncontracts. In various other transactions, the Company may (i)\nact as a derivative counterparty (e.g., interest rate swap,\ncross-currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a\ncredit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays\nthe total return on certain assets to the SPE), (ii) act as\nunderwriter\n                              148                               \nor placement agent, (iii) provide administrative, trustee or\nother services or (iv) make a market in debt securities or other\ninstruments issued by VIEs. The Company generally considers such\ninvolvement, by itself, not to be variable interests and thus\nnot an indicator of power or potentially significant benefits or\nlosses. The Company consolidates a VIE when it has both the\npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic performance and a right to receive benefits\nor the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be\npotentially significant to the VIE (that is, Citi is the primary\nbeneficiary). In addition to variable interests held in\nconsolidated VIEs, the Company has variable interests in other\nVIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the\nprimary beneficiary. All unconsolidated VIEs are monitored by\nthe Company to assess whether any events have occurred to cause\nits primary beneficiary status to change. All entities not\ndeemed to be VIEs with which the Company has involvement are\nevaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of ASC 810.See\nNote 23 for more detailed information. Transfers of Financial\nAssets For a transfer of financial assets to be considered a\nsale, (i) the assets must be legally isolated from the Company,\neven in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the purchaser\nmust have the right to pledge or sell the assets transferred\n(or, if the purchaser is an entity whose sole purpose is to\nengage in securitization and asset-backed financing activities\nthrough the issuance of beneficial interests and that entity is\nconstrained from pledging the assets it receives, each\nbeneficial interest holder must have the right to sell or pledge\ntheir beneficial interests), and (iii) the Company may not have\nan option or obligation to reacquire the assets. If these sale\nrequirements are met, the assets are removed from the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. If the conditions for sale are not\nmet, the transfer is considered to be a secured borrowing, the\nassets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the sale\nproceeds are recognized as the Company\u2019s liability. A legal\nopinion on a sale generally is obtained for complex transactions\nor where the Company has continuing involvement with the assets\ntransferred or with the securitization entity. For a transfer to\nbe eligible for sale accounting, that opinion must state that\nthe asset transfer would be considered a sale and that the\nassets transferred would not be consolidated with the Company\u2019s\nother assets in the event of the Company\u2019s insolvency. See Note\n23 for further discussion. Securitizations If the securitization\nentity is a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the\nprimary beneficiary (as discussed in \u201cVariable Interest\nEntities\u201d above). For all other securitization entities\ndetermined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates,\nconsolidation is based on which party has voting control of the\nentity, giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights\nin certain partnership structures. Only securitization entities\ncontrolled by Citigroup are consolidated. Where the Company is\nnot required to consolidate the securitization entity, the\ntransfer of financial assets to the entity is evaluated for sale\naccounting, as discussed in \u201cTransfers of Financial Assets\u201d\nabove. Interests in the securitized and sold assets may be\nretained in the form of subordinated or senior interest-only\nstrips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts and servicing\nrights. In credit card securitizations, the Company retains a\nseller\u2019s interest in the credit card receivables transferred to\nthe trusts, which is not in securitized form. In the case of\nconsolidated securitization entities, including the credit card\ntrusts, these retained interests are not reported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The securitized loans remain on the\nBalance Sheet. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or\nsecuritized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are\nU.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in\nnon-consolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified\nas Trading account assets , except for MSRs, which are included\nin Intangible assets on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nForeign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of Citi\u2019s\nforeign operations are translated from their respective\nfunctional currencies into U.S. dollars using period-end spot\nforeign exchange rates. The effects of those translation\nadjustments are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) (AOCI) , a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, net\nof any related hedge and tax effects, until realized upon sale\nor substantial liquidation of the foreign entity, at which point\nsuch amounts are reclassified into earnings. Revenues and\nexpenses of Citi\u2019s foreign operations are translated monthly\nfrom their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at\namounts that approximate weighted-average exchange rates. For\ntransactions that are denominated in a currency other than the\nfunctional currency, including transactions denominated in the\nlocal currencies of foreign operations that use the U.S. dollar\nas their functional currency, the effects of changes in exchange\nrates are primarily included in Principal transactions , along\nwith the related effects of any economic hedges. Instruments\nused to hedge foreign currency exposures include foreign\ncurrency forward, option and swap contracts and, in certain\ninstances, designated issues of non-U.S.-dollar debt. Foreign\noperations in countries with highly inflationary economies\ndesignate the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, with the\neffects of changes in exchange rates primarily included in Other\nrevenue . Investment Securities Investments include debt and\nequity securities. Debt securities include bonds, notes and\nredeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed and\nstructured securities that are subject to prepayment risk.\nEquity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred\nstock.\n                              149                               \nDebt Securities \u2022 Debt securities classified as \u201cheld-to-\nmaturity\u201d (HTM) are securities that the Company has both the\nability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at\namortized cost. \u2022 Debt securities classified as \u201cavailable-for-\nsale\u201d (AFS) are carried at fair value with changes in fair value\nreported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) , a\ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, net of applicable income\ntaxes and hedges. \u2022 Interest income on HTM and AFS debt\nsecurities is included in Interest revenue . Accrued interest on\nthese securities is subject to the Company\u2019s non-accrual policy,\nwhich results in the timely write-off of uncollectible accrued\ninterest. Debt securities are subject to evaluation for\nimpairment as described in Note 16 for HTM securities and in\nNote 14 for AFS securities. Realized gains and losses on sales\nof investments are included in earnings, primarily on a specific\nidentification basis. Equity Securities \u2022 Marketable equity\nsecurities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecognized in earnings. \u2022 Non-marketable equity securities are\nmeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in\nearnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or\n(ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal\nHome Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to\nbe carried at cost. Non-marketable equity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are carried at cost less impairment (if\nany), plus or minus changes resulting from observed prices for\norderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment\nof the same issuer. \u2022 Equity securities that are not measured at\nfair value through earnings are subject to evaluation for\nimpairment as described in Note 14. \u2022 Certain investments that\nwould otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method\nare carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized\nin earnings, where the Company has elected to apply fair value\naccounting, as described in Note 27. \u2022 The Company uses a number\nof valuation techniques for investments carried at fair value,\nwhich are described in Note 26. Trading Account Assets and\nLiabilities Trading account assets include debt and marketable\nequity securities, derivatives in a receivable position,\nresidual interests in securitizations and physical commodities\ninventory. In addition, as described in Note 27, certain assets\nthat Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair\nvalue option, such as loans and purchased guarantees, are also\nincluded in Trading account assets . Trading account liabilities\ninclude securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and\nderivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain\nliabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value\n(as described in Note 27). Other than physical commodities\ninventory, all trading account assets and liabilities are\ncarried at fair value. Revenues generated from trading assets\nand trading liabilities are generally reported in Principal\ntransactions and include realized gains and losses as well as\nunrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair\nvalue of such instruments. Interest income on trading assets,\nother than trading securities, is recorded in Interest revenue\nreduced by interest expense on trading liabilities. Interest\nincome on trading securities is recorded in Principal\ntransactions . Physical commodities inventory is carried at the\nlower of cost or market, except when included in a hedging\nrelationship. Any gains and losses related to physical\ncommodities inventory are reported in Principal transactions .\nRealized gains and losses on hedged commodities inventories and\nsales of commodities inventory are included in Principal\ntransactions . Investments in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) are accounted\nfor as hybrid instruments containing a debt host contract and an\nembedded non-financial derivative instrument indexed to the\nprice of the relevant precious metal. The embedded derivative\ninstrument and debt host contract are carried at fair value\nunder the fair value option, as described in Note 27. The\nCompany manages its exposures to market movements outside of its\ntrading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix,\neither directly or through the use of derivative financial\nproducts, including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards,\npurchased options and commodities, as well as foreign exchange\ncontracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value\nin Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities . See\nNote 24 for a further discussion of the Company\u2019s hedging and\nderivative activities. Derivatives include interest rate,\ncurrency, equity, credit and commodity swap agreements, options,\ncaps and floors, warrants, and financial and commodity futures\nand forward contracts. Derivative asset and liability positions\nare presented net by counterparty on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet when a valid master netting agreement exists and the other\nconditions set out in ASC Topic 210-20, Balance Sheet\u2014Offsetting\n, are met. See Note 24. The Company uses a number of techniques\nto determine the fair value of trading assets and liabilities,\nwhich are described in Note 26. Accounting for Derivative\nHedging Citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in\naccordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . As a general\nrule, hedge accounting is permitted where the Company is exposed\nto a particular risk, such as interest rate or foreign exchange\nrisk, that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or\nliability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an\nexisting asset, liability or a forecasted transaction that may\naffect earnings. Derivative contracts hedging the risks\nassociated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair\nvalue hedges, while contracts hedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are cash flow hedges. Hedges that\nutilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign\nexchange risk associated with equity investments in\nnon-U.S.-dollar-functional-\n                              150                               \ncurrency foreign subsidiaries (i.e., net investment in a foreign\noperation) are net investment hedges. To qualify as an\naccounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules (versus an\neconomic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied), a hedging\nrelationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk\ndesignated as being hedged. The hedging relationship must be\nformally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk\nmanagement objective and strategy for the hedge. This includes\nthe item and risk(s) being hedged, the hedging instrument being\nused and how effectiveness will be assessed. The effectiveness\nof these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception\nand on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective\nbasis, typically using quantitative measures of correlation.\nHedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a\nsimilar manner for similar hedges, and are used consistently\nthroughout the hedging relationships. The assessment of\neffectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged\nitem that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the\nchanges in fair value of the derivative associated with time\nvalue. Discontinued Hedge Accounting A hedging instrument must\nbe highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of\noffsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the\nhedged item for the risk being hedged. Management may\nvoluntarily de-designate an accounting hedge at any time, but if\na hedging relationship is not highly effective, it no longer\nqualifies for hedge accounting and must be de-designated.\nSubsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are\nrecognized in Other revenue or Principal transactions , similar\nto trading derivatives, with no offset recorded related to the\nhedged item. For fair value hedges, any changes in the carrying\nvalue of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the\nasset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of\nthe yield on the item. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair\nvalue of the end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and are included in the\nearnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows\nimpact earnings. However, if it becomes probable that some or\nall of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, any\namounts that remain in AOCI related to these transactions must\nbe immediately reflected in Other revenue . The foregoing\ncriteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with\nthe level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to\nvarious limits and controls. The underlying asset, liability or\nforecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio\nof similar items. Fair Value Hedges Hedging of Benchmark\nInterest Rate Risk Citigroup\u2019s fair value hedges, which include\nhedges of closed pools of assets, are primarily hedges of fixed-\nrate long-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt\nsecurities or loans. For qualifying fair value hedges of\ninterest rate risk, the changes in the fair value of the\nderivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are presented within Interest\nincome or Interest expense based on whether the hedged item is\nan asset or a liability. Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to\nforeign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt that are denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency of the entity holding the\nsecurities or issuing the debt. The hedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign exchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract. Changes in the fair value of the forward\npoints (i.e., the spot-forward difference) of forward contracts\nare excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are\ngenerally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the\nhedge. Citi also excludes changes in the fair value of cross-\ncurrency basis associated with cross-currency swaps from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and records them in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging of Commodity Price Risk Citigroup\nhedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price\nmovements in physical commodities inventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying\ncommodity. In this hedge, the change in the carrying value of\nthe hedged inventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the\nchange in the fair value of the futures contract that is also\nreflected in earnings. Although the entire change in the fair\nvalue of the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings, under\ncertain hedge programs, Citigroup excludes changes in the fair\nvalue of the forward points (i.e., spot-forward difference) of\nthe futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness,\nand they are generally reflected directly in earnings over the\nlife of the hedge. Under other hedge programs, Citi excludes\nchanges in the fair value of forward points from the assessment\nof hedge effectiveness and records them in Other comprehensive\nincome . Cumulative Basis Adjustment Upon electing to apply ASC\n815 fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of the\nhedged item is adjusted to reflect the cumulative changes in the\nhedged risk. This cumulative basis adjustment becomes part of\nthe carrying amount of the hedged item until the hedged item is\nderecognized from the balance sheet. Cash Flow Hedges Citigroup\nhedges the variability of forecasted cash flows due to changes\nin contractually specified interest rates associated with\nfloating-rate assets/liabilities and other forecasted\ntransactions. Variable cash flows from those liabilities are\nsynthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering\ninto receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps and\nreceive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate\nswaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are\nsynthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering\ninto receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash\nflow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or\ndollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging\nrelationships are highly effective at inception and on an\nongoing basis.\n                              151                               \nFor cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the\nhedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified\nto earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash\nflows impact earnings. Net Investment Hedges Consistent with ASC\n830-20, Foreign Currency Matters\u2014Foreign Currency Transactions ,\nASC 815 allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net\ninvestment in a foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign\ncurrency forwards, cross-currency swaps, options and foreign\ncurrency-denominated debt instruments to manage the foreign\nexchange risk associated with Citigroup\u2019s equity investments in\nseveral non-U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign\nsubsidiaries. Citi records the change in the fair value of these\nhedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the\ninvestments in these foreign subsidiaries in Foreign currency\ntranslation adjustmen t (CTA) within AOCI . For derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges, Citigroup follows the\nforward-rate method outlined in ASC 815-35-35. According to that\nmethod, all changes in fair value, including changes related to\nthe forward-rate component of the foreign currency forward\ncontracts and the time value of foreign currency options, are\nrecorded in CTA within AOCI . For foreign currency-denominated\ndebt instruments that are designated as hedges of net\ninvestments, the translation gain or loss that is recorded in\nCTA is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional\ncurrency of the respective subsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which\nis the functional currency of Citigroup. Economic Hedges\nCitigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would\nbe too complex or operationally burdensome. End-user derivatives\nthat are economic hedges are carried at fair value, with changes\nin value included in either Principal transactions or Other\nrevenue . For asset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate\nlong-term debt is recorded at amortized cost under GAAP. For\nother hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815 hedging\ncriteria or for which management decides not to apply ASC 815\nhedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair value on\nthe balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value\nrecorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be carried at\namortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are affected by the\ninterest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in\nthe swap\u2019s value, but for which no offsetting change in value is\nrecorded on the debt. Citigroup may alternatively elect to\naccount for the debt at fair value under the fair value option.\nOnce the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt,\nthe full change in fair value of the debt is reported in\nearnings. The changes in fair value of the related interest rate\nswap are also reflected in earnings, which provides a natural\noffset to the debt\u2019s fair value change. To the extent that the\ntwo amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of\nthe debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap,\nthe difference is automatically captured in current earnings.\nAdditional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk\ncomponent of commercial loans and loan commitments. Citigroup\nperiodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and\nmay designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge\nafter considering the relative costs and benefits. Economic\nhedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked-\nto-market through current earnings, such as hedges of\ncommitments to originate one- to four-family mortgage loans to\nbe HFS and MSRs. Securities Borrowed and Securities Loaned\nSecurities borrowing and lending transactions do not constitute\na sale of the underlying securities for accounting purposes and\nare treated as collateralized financing transactions. Such\ntransactions are recorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or\nreceived plus accrued interest. As described in Note 27, the\nCompany has elected to apply fair value accounting to a number\nof securities borrowing and lending transactions. Fees received\nor paid for all securities borrowing and lending transactions\nare recorded in Interest revenue or Interest expense at the\ncontractually specified rate. Where the conditions of ASC\n210-20-45-1, Balance Sheet\u2014Offsetting: Right of Setoff\nConditions , are met, securities borrowing and lending\ntransactions are presented net on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The Company monitors the fair value of securities\nborrowed or loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts\nadditional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin\nprotection. As described in Note 26, the Company uses a\ndiscounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of\nsecurities lending and borrowing transactions. Repurchase and\nResale Agreements Securities sold under agreements to repurchase\n(repos) and securities purchased under agreements to resell\n(reverse repos) do not constitute a sale (or purchase) of the\nunderlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as\ncollateralized financing transactions. As described in Note 27,\nthe Company has elected to apply fair value accounting to\ncertain portions of such transactions, with changes in fair\nvalue reported in earnings. Any transactions for which fair\nvalue accounting has not been elected are recorded at the amount\nof cash advanced or received plus accrued interest. Irrespective\nof whether the Company has elected fair value accounting,\ninterest paid or received on all repo and reverse repo\ntransactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest revenue\nat the contractually specified rate. Where the conditions of ASC\n210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet\u2014Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse\nRepurchase Agreements , are met, repos and reverse repos are\npresented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company\u2019s\npolicy is to take possession of securities purchased under\nreverse repurchase agreements. The Company monitors the fair\nvalue of securities subject to repurchase or resale on a daily\nbasis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to\nmaintain contractual margin protection. As described in Note 26,\nthe Company uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine\nthe fair value of repo and reverse repo transactions.\n                              152                               \nLoans Loans that are held-for-investment (HFI) are classified as\nLoans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reported at\ntheir outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income\nand unamortized deferred fees and costs, except for credit card\nreceivable balances, which include accrued interest and fees,\nand certain loans for which Citi has elected the fair value\noption (see \u201cLoans at Fair Value\u201d below). Loan origination fees\nand certain direct origination costs are generally deferred and\nrecognized as adjustments to income over the lives of the\nrelated loans. The related cash flows for HFI loans are included\nwithin the cash flows from the investing activities category in\nthe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line Change in\nloans . However, when the initial intent for holding a loan has\nchanged from HFI to held-for-sale (HFS), the loan is\nreclassified to HFS and included in Other assets , but the\nrelated cash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from\ninvesting activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\non the line Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans .\nSee \u201cLoans Held-for-Sale\u201d and \u201cChanges in Loan Classification\u201d\nbelow. Consumer Loans Consumer loans represent loans and leases\nmanaged primarily by the USPB , Wealth and All Other\u2014 Legacy\nFranchises businesses (except Mexico SBMM loans). Delinquency\nStatus Delinquency status is monitored and considered a key\nindicator of credit quality of consumer loans. Principally, the\nU.S. residential first mortgage loans use the Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation (MBA) method of reporting delinquencies, which\nconsiders a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been\nreceived by the end of the day immediately preceding the loan\u2019s\nnext due date. All other loans use a method of reporting\ndelinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a monthly\npayment has not been received by the close of business on the\nloan\u2019s next due date. Consumer Non-accrual Policies For\ninstallment and real estate loans, Citi\u2019s non-accrual policy is\nthat generally, prior to charge-off, interest accrual ceases\nwhen payments are 90days contractually past due (DPD), with the\nexception of certain loans insured by U.S. government agencies.\nCredit cards and other unsecured revolving loans generally are\nnot subject to non-accrual policies and continue to accrue\ninterest until charged off at 180 DPD. Details of Citi\u2019s charge-\noff policies are provided further below. Consumer Loan\nModification, Re-Aging and Return to Accrual Status Citi seeks\nto modify consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty to minimize losses, avoid foreclosure or repossession\nof collateral and ultimately maximize payments received from the\nborrowers. Citi uses various metrics to identify consumer\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty, with the primary\nindicator being delinquency at the time of modification. For\nU.S. consumer loans, generally one of the conditions to qualify\nfor modification is that a minimum number of payments (typically\nranging from one to three) must be made. For mortgage loans,\nCiti enters into a trial modification with the borrower, which\ngenerally represents a three-month period during which the\nborrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified\npayment terms, before entering into a permanent modification.\nThese loans under trial modification continue to age and accrue\ninterest in accordance with their original contractual terms.\nUpon permanent modification, the loan is re-aged to current\nstatus. Specifically, re-aging practices for certain open-ended\nconsumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines,\nwhich require at least three consecutive minimum monthly\npayments or the equivalent amount, to be re-aged to current\nstatus. In addition, re-aging is subject to limitations,\ngenerally once in 12 months and twice in five years.\nFurthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans\nmay only be modified under those respective agencies\u2019\nguidelines, and payments are not always required in order to re-\nage a modified loan to current. In general, a loan returns to\naccrual status when none of its principal and interest is due\nand unpaid and the bank expects the full collection of all\ncontractual principal and interest (including any prior charge-\noffs) on such loan. For modified loans, the policy for returning\nto accrual status varies by product and/or region. For regulated\nbank entities, such modified loans are returned to accrual\nstatus if a credit evaluation at the time of, or subsequent to,\nthe modification indicates the borrower is able to meet the\nrestructured terms, and the borrower is current and has\ndemonstrated a reasonable period of sustained payment\nperformance (minimum six monthsof consecutive payments).\nConsumer Charge-Off Policies Unless the loan had been modified\nand subsequently returned to accrual status per the above\npolicies, the loan is charged off following the general\nguidelines below: \u2022 Unsecured installment loans are charged off\nat 120 DPD, or if in bankruptcy, within 60 days of notification\nof filing by the bankruptcy court, if earlier. \u2022 Unsecured\nrevolving loans and credit card loans are charged off at 180\nDPD, or if in bankruptcy, within 60 days of notification of\nfiling by the bankruptcy court, if earlier. \u2022 Loans secured with\nnon-real estate collateral are written down to the estimated\nvalue of the collateral, less costs to sell, at 120 DPD. \u2022 Real\nestate-secured loans are written down to the estimated value of\nthe property, less costs to sell, at 180 DPD, with the following\nexceptions: (i) if the decision is made not to foreclose, loans\nare charged off no later than 180 DPD; or (ii) if in bankruptcy,\nother than FHA-insured loans, loans are charged off within 60\ndays of notification of filing by the bankruptcy court, if\nearlier.\n                              153                               \nCorporate Loans Corporate loans represent loans and leases\nmanaged by Services , Markets and Banking and the Mexico SBMM\ncomponent of All Other \u2014Legacy Franchises. Corporate loans are\nplaced on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal\nis 90days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized\nand in the process of collection. When a corporate loan is\nplaced on non-accrual, any interest accrued is reversed and\ncharged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter\nincluded in earnings only to the extent actually received in\ncash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility\nof principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce\nthe recorded investment in the loan. Cash-basis loans are\nreturned to accrual status when all contractual principal and\ninterest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there\nis a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance\nwith the contractual terms. Corporate loans are written down to\nthe extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectible. A\nfinancial asset is considered collateral-dependent when the\ndebtor is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is\nexpected to be provided substantially through the operation or\nsale of the collateral. For corporate loans that are collateral\ndependent, the fair value of collateral (less costs to sell, as\napplicable) is used to estimate expected credit losses. Loans\nHeld-for-Sale Loans that have been identified for sale are\nclassified as loans HFS and included in Other assets . With the\nexception of those loans for which the fair value option has\nbeen elected, HFS loans are accounted for at the lower of cost\nor market value, with any write-downs or subsequent recoveries\ncharged to Other revenue . The related cash flows are classified\nin the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows\nfrom operating activities category on the line Change in loans\nHFS . Gains and losses on loans HFS are generally presented in\nOther revenue . Gains on sales of fully or partially charged-off\nloans are presented as gross credit recoveries in the Provision\nfor credit losses up to the amount of prior charge-offs. Loans\nat Fair Value As described in Note 27, Citi has elected fair\nvalue accounting for certain loans. Such loans are not subject\nto an allowance for credit losses. Instead, they are carried at\nfair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings.\nInterest income on such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at\nthe contractually specified rate. The practice of Citi\u2019s U.S.\nprime mortgage business has been to sell substantially all of\nits conforming loans. As such, U.S. prime mortgage conforming\nloans are classified as HFS and the fair value option is elected\nat origination, with changes in fair value recorded in Other\nrevenue . Changes in Loan Classification Changes to the initial\nclassification of a loan should be made only when there is a\ndemonstrated change in management\u2019s intent and ability (i.e.,\nmanagement now has the intent and ability to sell the loan when\nit had previously intended to hold the loan for the foreseeable\nfuture or vice versa). If a loan changes its classification from\nHFI to HFS, the related allowance for credit losses is reversed\nin earnings through the Provision for credit losses . Also, if\nthe loan\u2019s fair value is lower than the loan\u2019s amortized cost\nbasis due to credit deterioration, the initial downward\ndifference is recorded as a direct write-off of the loan\u2019s\namortized cost basis through gross credit losses, which\nestablishes the new cost basis of the loan immediately prior to\ntransfer to HFS for purposes of applying the lower of cost or\nmarket value. Otherwise, any write down is recorded as an HFS\nvaluation allowance (contra- Other assets ) and charged to Other\nrevenue . On the other hand, if a loan changes its\nclassification from HFS to HFI, any HFS valuation allowance is\nreversed through Other revenue . The loan is transferred to HFI\nat its amortized cost basis and assessed for an allowance for\ncredit losses. Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL) The current\nexpected credit losses (CECL) methodology is based on relevant\ninformation about past events, including historical experience,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and supportable (R&S)\nforecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported\nfinancial asset balances. If the asset\u2019s life extends beyond the\nR&S forecast period, then historical experience is considered\nover the remaining life of the assets in the ACL. The resulting\nACL is adjusted in each subsequent reporting period through\nProvisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome to reflect changes in history, current conditions and\nforecasts as well as changes in asset positions and portfolios.\nASC 326 defines the ACL as a valuation account that is deducted\nfrom the amortized cost of a financial asset to present the net\namount that management expects to collect on the financial asset\nover its expected life. All financial assets carried at\namortized cost are in the scope of ASC 326, while assets\nmeasured at fair value are excluded. See Note 14 for a\ndiscussion of impairment on available-for-sale (AFS) securities.\nIncreases and decreases to the allowances are recorded in\nProvisions for credit losses . The CECL methodology utilizes a\nlifetime expected credit loss (ECL) measurement objective for\nthe recognition of credit losses for held-for-investment (HFI)\nloans, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, receivables and\nother financial assets measured at amortized cost at the time\nthe financial asset is originated or acquired. Within the life\nof a loan or other financial asset, the methodology generally\nresults in earlier recognition of the provision for credit\nlosses and the related ACL. Estimation of ECLs requires Citi to\nmake assumptions regarding the likelihood and severity of credit\nloss events and their impact on expected cash flows, which drive\nthe probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD) models and, where Citi discounts the\nECL, using discounting techniques for certain products. Citi\nconsiders a multitude of global macroeconomic variables for the\nbase, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic\nscenario forecasts it uses to estimate the ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts\nof the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key macroeconomic variables that most\nsignificantly affect its estimate of the ACL.\n                              154                               \nUnder the base macroeconomic forecast as of 4Q24, U.S. real GDP\ngrowth is expected to slow during 2025 and 2026, while the\nunemployment rate is expected to increase in 2025, but decline\nin 2026. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using\na statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into\nconsideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of\nthe scenario and other macroeconomic uncertainties and risks.\nCiti evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the\nbase scenario, Citi\u2019s downside scenario reflects a recession,\nincluding an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8%\nover the eight-quarter R&S period, with a peak difference of\n3.4% in the second quarter of 2026. The downside scenario also\nreflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2025 of\n1.8%, with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference to the base\nscenario of 1.3%. The following are the main factors and\ninterpretations that Citi considers when estimating the ACL\nunder the CECL methodology: \u2022 CECL reserves are estimated over\nthe contractual term of the financial asset, which is adjusted\nfor expected prepayments. Expected extensions are generally not\nconsidered unless the option to extend the loan cannot be\ncanceled unilaterally by Citi. \u2022 Credit enhancements that are\nnot freestanding (such as those that are included in the\noriginal terms of the contract or those executed in conjunction\nwith the lending transaction) are considered loss mitigants for\npurposes of CECL reserve estimation. \u2022 For unconditionally\ncancelable accounts (generally credit cards), reserves are based\non the expected life of the balance as of the evaluation date\n(assuming no further charges) and do not include any undrawn\ncommitments that are unconditionally cancelable. Reserves are\nincluded for undrawn commitments for accounts that are not\nunconditionally cancelable (such as letters of credit and\ncorporate loan commitments, home equity lines of credit\n(HELOCs), undrawn mortgage loan commitments and financial\nguarantees). \u2022 CECL models are designed to be economically\nsensitive. They utilize the macroeconomic forecasts provided by\nCiti\u2019s enterprise scenario group that are approved by senior\nmanagement. Analysis is performed and documented to determine\nthe necessary qualitative management adjustment (QMA) to capture\nidiosyncratic events and model uncertainty. \u2022 The portion of the\nforecast that reflects the enterprise scenario group\u2019s R&S\nperiod indicates the maximum length of time its models can\nproduce a R&S macroeconomic forecast, after which mean reversion\nreflecting historical loss experience is used for the remaining\nlife of the loan to estimate expected credit losses. For the\nloss forecast, businesses consume the macroeconomic forecast as\ndetermined to be appropriate and justifiable. Citi\u2019s ability to\nforecast credit losses over the R&S period is based on the\nability to forecast economic activity over a reasonable and\nsupportable time window. The R&S period reflects the overall\nability to have a reasonable and supportable forecast of credit\nloss based on economic forecasts. The R&S forecast period for\nconsumer and corporate loans is eight quarters. \u2022 The loss\nmodels consume all or a portion of the R&S economic forecast and\nthen revert to historical loss experience. \u2022 The ACL\nincorporates provisions for accrued interest on products that\nare not subject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy\n(e.g., credit cards, etc.). \u2022 Citi uses the most recent\navailable information to inform its macroeconomic forecasts,\nallowing sufficient time for analysis of the results and\ncorresponding approvals. Key variables are reviewed for\nsignificant changes through year end and changes to portfolio\npositions are reflected in the ACL. \u2022 Reserves are calculated at\nan appropriately granular level and on a pooled basis where\nfinancial assets share risk characteristics. At a minimum,\nreserves are calculated at a portfolio level (product and\ncountry). Where a financial asset does not share risk\ncharacteristics with any of the pools, it is evaluated for\ncredit losses individually. Quantitative and Qualitative\nComponents of the ACL The loss likelihood and severity models\nuse both internal and external information and are sensitive to\nforecasts of different macroeconomic conditions. For the\nquantitative component, Citi uses multiple macroeconomic\nscenarios and associated probabilities to estimate the ECL.\nEstimates of these ECLs are based upon (i) Citigroup\u2019s internal\nsystem of credit risk ratings, (ii) historical default and loss\ndata, including comprehensive internal history and rating agency\ninformation regarding default rates and internal data on the\nseverity of losses in the event of default, and (iii) a R&S\nforecast of future macroeconomic conditions. ECL is determined\nprimarily by utilizing models for the borrowers\u2019 PD, LGD and\nEAD. Adjustments may be made to this data, including (i)\nstatistically calculated estimates to cover the historical\nfluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, the\nhistorical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans\nand the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations\nin the global portfolio, and (ii) adjustments made for\nspecifically known items, such as current environmental factors\nand credit trends. Any adjustments needed to the modeled\nexpected losses in the quantitative calculations are addressed\nthrough a qualitative adjustment. The qualitative adjustment\nconsiders, among other things: certain portfolio characteristics\nand concentrations; collateral coverage; model limitations;\nidiosyncratic events; and other relevant criteria under banking\nsupervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative adjustment\nalso reflects the estimated impact of the pandemic on the\neconomic forecasts and the impact on credit loss estimates. The\ntotal ACL is composed of the quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Citi\u2019s qualitative component declined year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by (i) the full release of COVID-19\u2013\n                              155                               \nrelated uncertainty reserves, as the portfolio delinquencies and\nlosses have increased and these risks are now captured in the\nquantitative component of the ACL, and (ii) releases related to\nreserves for specific risks and uncertainties impacting\nvulnerable industries and regions, partially offset by increases\nin transfer risk associated with exposures outside of the U.S.,\ndriven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking\nlaw. See \u201cAccounting Changes\u201d below for information about how\nthe calculation of the quantitative component of the ACL changed\nin 2024. Consumer Loans For consumer loans, most portfolios\nincluding North America cards, mortgages and personal\ninstallment loans (PILs) are covered by the PD, LGD and EAD loss\nforecasting models. Some smaller international portfolios are\ncovered by econometric models where the gross credit loss (GCL)\nrate is forecast. The modeling of all retail products is\nperformed by examining risk drivers for a given portfolio; these\ndrivers relate to exposures with similar credit risk\ncharacteristics and consider past events, current conditions and\nR&S forecasts. Under the PD x LGD x EAD approach, GCLs and\nrecoveries are captured on an undiscounted basis. Citi\nincorporates expected recoveries on loans into its reserve\nestimate, including expected recoveries on assets previously\nwritten off. CECL defines the exposure\u2019s expected life as the\nremaining contractual maturity including any expected\nprepayments. Subsequent changes to the contractual terms that\nare the result of a re-underwriting are not included in the\nloan\u2019s expected CECL life. Citi does not establish reserves for\nthe uncollectible accrued interest on non-revolving consumer\nproducts, such as mortgages and installment loans, which are\nsubject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy at 90 days\npast due. As such, only the principal balance is subject to the\nCECL reserve methodology and interest does not attract a further\nreserve. For credit cards, Citi uses the payment rate approach,\nwhich leverages payment rate curves, to determine the payments\nthat should be applied to liquidate the end-of-period balance\n(CECL balance) in the estimation of EAD. The payment rate\napproach uses customer payment behavior (payment rate) to\nestablish the portion of the CECL balance that will be paid each\nmonth. These payment rates are defined as the percentage of\nprincipal payments received in the respective month divided by\nthe prior month\u2019s billed principal balance. The liquidation\n(CECL payment) amount for each forecast period is determined by\nmultiplying the CECL balance by that period\u2019s forecasted payment\nrate. The cumulative sum of these payments less the CECL balance\nproduces the balance liquidation curve. Citi does not apply a\nnon-accrual policy to credit card receivables; rather, they are\nsubject to full charge-off at 180 days past due or bankruptcy.\nAs such, the entire customer balance up until write-off,\nincluding accrued interest and fees, is subject to the CECL\nreserve methodology. Corporate Loans, HTM Securities and Other\nAssets Citi records allowances for credit losses on all\nfinancial assets carried at amortized cost that are in the scope\nof CECL, including corporate loans classified as HFI, HTM debt\nsecurities and Other assets . Discounting techniques are applied\nfor corporate loans classified as HFI and HTM securities. All\ncash flows are fully discounted to the reporting date. The ACL\nincludes Citi\u2019s estimate of all credit losses expected to be\nincurred over the estimated full contractual life of the\nfinancial asset. The contractual life of the financial asset\ngenerally does not include expected extensions, renewals or\nmodifications. Where Citi has an unconditional option to extend\nthe contractual term, Citi does not consider the potential\nextension in determining the contractual term; however, where\nthe borrower has the sole right to exercise the extension option\nwithout Citi\u2019s approval, Citi does consider the potential\nextension in determining the contractual term. The Company\nprimarily bases its ACL on models that assess the likelihood and\nseverity of credit events and their impact on cash flows under\nR&S forecasted economic scenarios. Allowances consider the\nprobability of the borrower\u2019s default, the loss the Company\nwould incur upon default and the borrower\u2019s exposure at default.\nSuch models discount the present value of all future cash flows,\nusing the asset\u2019s effective interest rate (EIR). Citi applies a\nmore simplified approach based on historical loss rates to\ncertain exposures recorded in Other assets and certain loan\nexposures in the Private Bank within Consumer loans . The\nCompany considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero for U.S.\nTreasuries and U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, as such, Citi does not\nhave an ACL for these securities. For all other HTM debt\nsecurities, ECLs are estimated using PD models and discounting\ntechniques, which incorporate assumptions regarding the\nlikelihood and severity of credit losses. For structured\nsecurities, specific models use relevant assumptions for the\nunderlying collateral type. A discounting approach is applied to\nHTM direct obligations of a single issuer, similar to that used\nfor corporate HFI loans. Other Financial Assets with Zero\nExpected Credit Losses For certain financial assets, zero\nexpected credit losses will be recognized where the expectation\nof nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, based on\nthere being no history of loss and the nature of the\nreceivables. Secured Financing Transactions Most of Citi\u2019s\nreverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing arrangements\nand margin loans require that the borrower continually adjust\nthe amount of the collateral securing Citi\u2019s interest, primarily\nresulting from changes in the fair value of such collateral. In\nsuch arrangements, ACLs are recorded based only on the amount by\nwhich the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of\nthe collateral. No ACLs are recorded where the fair value of the\ncollateral is equal to or exceeds the asset\u2019s amortized cost\nbasis, as Citi does not expect to incur credit losses on such\nwell-collateralized exposures. For certain margin loans\npresented in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, ACLL is\nestimated using the same approach as corporate loans.\n                              156                               \nAccrued Interest CECL permits entities to make an accounting\npolicy election not to reserve for interest, if the entity has a\npolicy in place that will result in timely reversal or write-off\nof interest. However, when a non-accrual or timely charge-off\npolicy is not applied, an ACL is recognized on accrued interest\nat 90 days past due. For HTM debt securities, Citi established a\nnon-accrual policy that results in timely write-off of accrued\ninterest. For corporate loans, where a timely charge-off policy\nis used, Citi has elected to recognize an ACL on accrued\ninterest receivable. The LGD models for corporate loans include\nan adjustment for estimated accrued interest. Reasonably\nExpected TDRs (in 2022 and prior years) For corporate loans, the\nreasonable expectation of the TDR concept required that the\ncontractual life over which ECLs are estimated be extended when\na TDR that results in a tenor extension was reasonably expected.\nReasonably expected TDRs were included in the life of the asset.\nA discounting technique or collateral-dependent practical\nexpedient is used for non-accrual and TDR loan exposures that do\nnot share risk characteristics with other loans and are\nindividually assessed. Loans modified in accordance with the\nCARES Act and bank regulatory guidance are not classified as\nTDRs. In 2023, the reasonably expected TDRs accounting was\nreplaced by modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty accounting. See \u201cAccounting Changes\u2014TDRs\nand Vintage Disclosures\u201d below for a description of this new\naccounting. Purchased Credit-Deteriorated (PCD) Assets ASC 326\nrequires entities that have acquired financial assets (such as\nloans and HTM securities) with an intent to hold, to evaluate\nwhether those assets have experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since origination. These assets\nare subject to specialized accounting at initial recognition\nunder CECL. Subsequent measurement of PCD assets will remain\nconsistent with other purchased or originated assets, i.e., non-\nPCD assets. CECL introduced the notion of PCD assets, which\nreplaced purchased credit impaired (PCI) accounting under prior\nU.S. GAAP. CECL requires the estimation of credit losses to be\nperformed on a pool basis unless a PCD asset does not share\ncharacteristics with any pool. If certain PCD assets do not meet\nthe conditions for aggregation, those PCD assets should be\naccounted for separately. This determination must be made at the\ndate the PCD asset is purchased. In estimating ECLs from day 2\nonward, pools can potentially be reassembled based upon similar\nrisk characteristics. When PCD assets are pooled, Citi\ndetermines the amount of the initial ACL at the pool level. The\namount of the initial ACL for a PCD asset represents the portion\nof the total discount at acquisition that relates to credit and\nis recognized as a \u201cgross-up\u201d of the purchase price to arrive at\nthe PCD asset\u2019s (or pool\u2019s) amortized cost. Any difference\nbetween the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost is\nconsidered to be related to non-credit factors and results in a\ndiscount or premium, which is amortized to interest income over\nthe life of the individual asset (or pool). Direct expenses\nincurred related to the acquisition of PCD assets and other\nassets and liabilities in a business combination are expensed as\nincurred. Subsequent accounting for acquired PCD assets is the\nsame as the accounting for originated assets; changes in the\nallowance are recorded in Provisions for credit losses .\nConsumer Citi does not purchase whole portfolios of PCD assets\nin its retail businesses. However, there may be a small portion\nof a purchased portfolio that is identified as PCD at the\npurchase date. Interest income recognition does not vary between\nPCD and non-PCD assets. A consumer financial asset is considered\nto be more-than-insignificantly credit deteriorated if it is\nmore than 30 days past due at the purchase date. Corporate Citi\ngenerally classifies wholesale loans and debt securities\nclassified as HTM or AFS as PCD when both of the following\ncriteria are met: (i) the purchase price discount is at least\n10% of par and (ii) the purchase date is more than 90 days after\nthe origination or issuance date. Citi classifies HTM beneficial\ninterests rated AA- and lower obtained at origination from\ncertain securitization transactions as PCD when there is a\nsignificant difference (i.e., 10% or greater) between\ncontractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayments, and expected\ncash flows at the date of recognition. Reserve Estimates and\nPolicies Management provides reserves for an estimate of\nlifetime ECLs in the funded loan portfolio on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet in the form of an ACL. These reserves are\nestablished in accordance with Citigroup\u2019s credit reserve\npolicies, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors. Citi\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer review the adequacy of the credit loss\nreserves each quarter with risk management and finance\nrepresentatives for each applicable business area. Applicable\nbusiness areas include those having classifiably managed\nportfolios, where internal credit risk ratings are assigned\n(primarily Services , Markets , Banking and Wealth ) and\ndelinquency-managed portfolios (primarily USPB ) or modified\nconsumer loans, where concessions were granted due to the\nborrowers\u2019 financial difficulties. The aforementioned\nrepresentatives for these business areas present recommended\nreserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending\nportfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative\ndata discussed below. Estimated Credit Losses for Portfolios of\nPerforming Exposures Risk management and finance representatives\nwho cover business areas with delinquency-managed portfolios\ncontaining smaller-balance homogeneous loans present their\nrecommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators,\nincluding loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as\nwell as economic trends, including current and future housing\nprices, unemployment, length of time in foreclosure, costs to\nsell and GDP. This methodology is applied separately for each\nproduct within each geographic region in which these portfolios\nexist. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates\nand judgments.\n                              157                               \nRisk management and finance representatives who cover business\nareas with classifiably managed portfolios present their\nrecommended reserve balances based on the frequency of default,\nrisk ratings, loss recovery rates, size and diversity of\nindividual large credits, and ability of borrowers with foreign\ncurrency obligations to obtain the foreign currency necessary\nfor orderly debt servicing for countries with currency\nrestrictions. Changes in these estimates could have a direct\nimpact on the credit costs in any period and could result in a\nchange in the allowance. Allowance for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments Credit loss reserves are recognized on all off-\nbalance sheet commitments that are not unconditionally\ncancelable. Corporate loan EAD models include an incremental\nusage factor (or credit conversion factor) to estimate ECLs on\namounts undrawn at the reporting date. Off-balance sheet\ncommitments include unfunded exposures, revolving facilities,\nsecurities underwriting commitments, letters of credit, HELOCs\nand financial guarantees (excluding performance guarantees).\nThis reserve is classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in\nOther liabilities . Changes to the allowance for unfunded\nlending commitments are recorded in Provision for credit losses\non unfunded lending commitments . Mortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recognized as intangible\nassets when the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired\nthrough purchase or origination and retains the right to service\nthe loans. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair\nvalue, with changes in value recorded in Other revenue in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s MSRs, see Notes 17, 23 and 26.\nGoodwill Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over\nthe fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in\na business combination. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment\ntesting and interim assessments between annual tests if an event\noccurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying\namount. The Company has determined that its reporting units are\nat the reportable operating segment level or one level below.\nThe Company has an option to assess qualitative factors to\ndetermine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment\ntest. If, after assessing the totality of events or\ncircumstances, the Company determines that it is not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less\nthan its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If,\nhowever, the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\ncarrying amount, then the Company must perform the quantitative\ntest. The Company has an unconditional option to bypass the\nqualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting\nperiod and proceed directly to the quantitative test. The\nquantitative test requires a comparison of the fair value of an\nindividual reporting unit to its carrying value, including\ngoodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of\nthe carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not\nimpaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying\nvalue of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, an impairment\nloss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nUpon any business disposition, goodwill is allocated to, and\nderecognized with, the disposed business based on the ratio of\nthe fair value of the disposed business to the fair value of the\nreporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany voluntarily changed its annual impairment assessment\ndate from July 1 to October 1. Additional information on Citi\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing can be found in Note 17. Intangible\nAssets Intangible assets\u2014 including core deposit intangibles,\npresent value of future profits, purchased credit card\nrelationships, credit card contract-related intangibles, other\ncustomer relationships and other intangible assets, but\nexcluding MSRs\u2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nCredit card contract-related intangibles include fixed and\nunconditional costs incurred to renew or extend the contract\nwith a card partner. In estimating the useful life of a credit\ncard contract-related intangible, the Company considers the\nprobability of contract renewal or extension to determine the\nperiod that the asset is expected to contribute future cash\nflows. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite\nuseful lives, primarily trade names, are not amortized and are\nsubject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the\ncarrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds\nits fair value. For other intangible assets subject to\namortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount\nis not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible\nasset. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment includes\nlease right-of-use assets, property and equipment (including\npurchased and developed software), net of depreciation and\namortization. Substantially all lease right-of-use assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and\nsubstantially all property and equipment are depreciated or\namortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the\nasset. The estimated useful lives range up to 50 years for\nbuildings and improvements, up to 15 years for furniture and\nequipment, up to 10 years for internal-use software and the\nshorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term for\nleasehold improvements.\n                              158                               \nLeases As a Lessee Citi enters into lease agreements to obtain\nrights to use assets for its business operations. Substantially\nall of the Company\u2019s lessee arrangements are operating leases\nfor premises and equipment, including real estate and various\ntypes of equipment. Lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU)\nassets are recognized when Citi enters into these leases and\nrepresent Citi\u2019s obligations and rights to use these assets over\nthe period of the leases, and may be remeasured for certain\nmodifications. These leases may contain renewal and extension\noptions and early termination features; however, these options\ndo not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably\ncertain that it will exercise the options. In certain instances,\nthe Company may have lease agreements with lease and non-lease\ncomponents. In these instances, the Company has elected to apply\nthe practical expedient and account for the lease and non-lease\ncomponents as a single lease component for all leases. At lease\ncommencement, lease liabilities are recognized based on the\npresent value of the remaining lease payments and discounted\nusing the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. ROU assets\ninitially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease\npayments made prior to lease commencement and for any lease\nincentives. ROU assets and lease liabilities are included in\nPremises and equipment and Other liabilities , respectively. All\nleases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except\nthose with an initial term of less than 12 months, for which the\nCompany has made the short-term lease election. Lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is\nrecorded in Premises and equipment expense in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Variable lease costs are recognized in the\nperiod in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nAs a Lessor The Company\u2019s operating leases and financing leases,\nwhich include both direct financing and sales-type leases, where\nCiti is a lessor, are not significant to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Other Assets and Other Liabilities Other\nassets include, among other items, loans HFS, deferred tax\nassets, equity method investments, interest and fees receivable,\nrepossessed assets, other receivables and assets from businesses\nclassified as HFS that are reclassified from other balance sheet\nline items. Other liabilities include, among other items,\naccrued expenses, lease liabilities, deferred tax liabilities,\nreserves for legal claims and legal fee accruals, taxes,\nunfunded lending commitments, repositioning reserves, other\npayables and liabilities from businesses classified as HFS that\nare reclassified from other balance sheet line items. Legal fee\naccruals are recognized as incurred. Other Real Estate Owned and\nRepossessed Assets Real estate or other assets received through\nforeclosure or repossession are generally reported in Other\nassets , net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and\nsubsequent declines in fair value. Debt Short-term borrowings\nand Long-term debt are accounted for at amortized cost, except\nwhere the Company has elected to report the debt instruments\n(including certain structured notes) at fair value, or debt that\nis in a fair value hedging relationship. Changes in the fair\nvalue of debt instruments carried at fair value under a fair\nvalue election are recorded in Principal transactions , other\nthan adjustments related to changes in the Company\u2019s credit,\nwhich are recorded in Other comprehensive income . Premiums,\ndiscounts and issuance costs on long-term debt accounted for at\namortized cost are amortized over the contractual term using the\neffective interest method. Instrument-Specific Credit Risk Citi\npresents separately in AOCI the portion of the total change in\nthe fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the\ninstrument-specific credit risk, when management has elected to\nmeasure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair\nvalue option for financial instruments. Accordingly, the change\nin fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option was\nelected related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit spreads is\npresented in AOCI . Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits\nexpense includes current service costs of pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans (which are accrued on a current\nbasis), contributions and unrestricted awards under other\nemployee plans, the amortization of restricted stock awards and\ncosts of other employee benefits. For its most significant\npension and postretirement benefit plans (Significant Plans),\nCitigroup measures and discloses plan obligations, plan assets\nand periodic plan expense quarterly, instead of annually. The\neffect of remeasuring the Significant Plan obligations and\nassets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly\nbasis is reflected in AOCI and periodic plan expense. All other\nplans (All Other Plans) are remeasured annually. Benefits earned\nduring the year are reported in Compensation and benefits\nexpenses and all other components of the net annual benefit cost\nare reported in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income.See Note 8. Stock-Based Compensation The\nCompany recognizes compensation expense related to stock awards\nover the requisite service period, generally based on the\ninstruments\u2019 grant-date fair value, reduced by actual\nforfeitures as they occur. Compensation cost related to awards\ngranted to employees who meet certain age plus years-of-service\nrequirements (retirement-eligible employees) is accrued in the\nyear prior to the grant date in the same manner as the accrual\nfor cash incentive compensation. Certain stock awards with\nperformance conditions or certain clawback provisions are\nsubject to variable accounting, pursuant to\n                              159                               \nwhich the associated compensation expense fluctuates with\nchanges in Citigroup\u2019s common stock price.See Note 7.\nTransactional and Tax Charges Transactional and tax charges ,\nwhich largely comprises costs that are driven by revenues and\ntransaction volumes, is primarily composed of brokerage exchange\nand clearance costs, exchange fees, regulatory memberships and\ncertain indirect, non-income tax payments that are not recorded\nin Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Income Taxes The Company is subject to the income tax\nlaws of the U.S. and its states and municipalities, as well as\nthe non-U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws\nare complex and may be subject to different interpretations by\nthe taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities.\nIn establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company\nmust make judgments and interpretations about these tax laws.\nThe Company must also make estimates about when in the future\ncertain items will affect taxable income in the various tax\njurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and\nadjudication by the court systems of the various tax\njurisdictions, or may be settled with the taxing authority upon\nexamination or audit. The Company treats interest and penalties\non income taxes as a component of Income tax expense . Deferred\ntaxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that\nhave been, or will be, recognized in financial statements or tax\nreturns in different periods, based upon enacted tax laws and\nrates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment about whether realization is more-likely-\nthan-not. ASC 740, Income Taxes , sets out a consistent\nframework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to\nmaintain for uncertain tax positions. This interpretation uses a\ntwo-step approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized if a\nposition is more-likely-than-not to be sustained. The amount of\nthe benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that\nis more than 50% likely to be realized. ASC 740 also sets out\ndisclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entity\u2019s\ntax reserves. See Note 10 for a further description of the\nCompany\u2019s tax provision and related income tax assets and\nliabilities. Commissions, Underwriting and Principal\nTransactions Commissions and fees revenues are recognized in\nincome when earned. Underwriting revenues are recognized in\nincome typically at the closing of the transaction. Principal\ntransactions revenues are recognized in income on a trade-date\nbasis.See Note 5 for a description of the Company\u2019s revenue\nrecognition policies for Commissions and fees , and Note 6 for\ndetails of Principal transactions revenue. Earnings per Share\nEarnings per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class\nmethod. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed\nand undistributed) are allocated to common stock and\nparticipating securities. Undistributed earnings are calculated\nafter deducting preferred stock dividends, any issuance cost\nincurred at the time of issuance of redeemed preferred stock and\ndividends paid and accrued to common stocks and RSU/DSA share\nawards. Citi grants restricted and deferred share awards under\nits shares-based compensation programs, which entitle recipients\nto receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on\na basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of\nparticipating securities based on their respective rights to\nreceive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a\nseparate class of securities and are not included in computing\nbasic EPS. Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of\ncontingently issuable shares, stock options and awards, which\nrequire future service as a condition of delivery of the\nunderlying common stock. Anti-dilutive options and warrants are\ndisregarded in the EPS calculations. Diluted EPS is calculated\nunder both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the\nmore dilutive amount is reported. Participating securities are\nnot included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS. Use\nof Estimates Management must make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related\nNotes. Such estimates are used in connection with certain fair\nvalue measurements. See Note 26 for further discussions on\nestimates used in the determination of fair value. Moreover,\nestimates are significant in determining the amounts of other-\nthan-temporary impairments, impairments of goodwill and other\nintangible assets, provisions for probable losses that may arise\nfrom credit-related exposures, probable and estimable losses\nrelated to litigation and regulatory proceedings, and income\ntaxes. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts\nor results could differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents\nand Restricted Cash Flows Cash equivalents are composed of those\namounts included in Cash and due from banks and Deposits with\nbanks . Certain cash balances are restricted by regulatory or\ncontractual requirements.See Note 28 for additional information\non restricted cash. Related Party Transactions The Company has\nrelated party transactions with certain of its subsidiaries and\naffiliates. These transactions, which are primarily short-term\nin nature, include cash accounts, collateralized financing\ntransactions, margin accounts, derivative transactions, charges\nfor operational support and the borrowing and lending of funds,\nand are entered into in the ordinary course of business.\n                              160                               \nACCOUNTING CHANGES Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements\nto Reportable Segment Disclosures In November 2023, the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , intended\nto improve reportable segments disclosure requirements primarily\nthrough enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.\nThe ASU includes a requirement to disclose significant segment\nexpenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure\nof segment profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM,\nan explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of\nsegment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and\ndeciding how to allocate resources, and all segments\u2019 profit or\nloss and assets disclosures currently required annually by Topic\n280 along with those introduced by the ASU to be reported on an\ninterim basis. The amendments also clarified that public\nentities are not precluded from reporting additional measures of\na segment\u2019s profit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM.\nCiti adopted the ASU on a retrospective basis for its annual\nperiod ending December 31, 2024 and the ASU for the interim\nperiod beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 3 for further\ndetails. Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU\nNo. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value\nMeasurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale\nRestrictions . The ASU was issued to address diversity in\npractice whereby certain entities included the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when valuing equity securities, and it\nclarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an\nequity security should not be considered part of the unit of\naccount of the equity security and, therefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair value. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to disclose the fair value of equity\nsecurities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature\nand remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances\nthat could cause a lapse in the restrictions. Citi adopted the\nASU on January 1, 2024, which did not impact the financial\nstatements of the Company. Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023-02, Investments\u2014Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic\n323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using\nthe Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expanded the\nscope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the\nproportional amortization method of accounting. Under the\nproportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible\ninvestment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits\nand other income tax benefits that are received by the investor,\nwith the amortization of the investment and the income tax\ncredits being presented net in the income statement as\ncomponents of income tax expense (benefit). The ASU permits the\nCompany to elect to use the proportional amortization method to\naccount for an expanded range of eligible tax-incentivized\ninvestments if certain conditions are met. Citi adopted the ASU\non January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact to the\nfinancial statements of the Company. TDRs and Vintage\nDisclosures In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (FASB) issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures . Citi adopted the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2023, including the guidance on the recognition and\nmeasurement of TDRs under the modified retrospective approach.\nAdopting these amendments resulted in a decrease to the ACLL of\n$ 352million and an increase in other assets related to held-\nfor-sale businesses of $ 40million, with a corresponding\nincrease to retained earnings of $ 290million and a decrease in\ndeferred tax assets of $ 102million on January 1, 2023. The ACL\nfor corporate loans was unaffected because the measurement\napproach used for corporate loans is not in the scope of this\nASU. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and disclosure\nrequirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the\nACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. With\nthe elimination of TDR accounting requirements, reasonably\nexpected TDRs are no longer considered when determining the term\nover which to estimate expected credit losses. The ACLL for\nmodified loans that are collateral dependent continues to be\nbased on the fair value of the collateral. Consumer Loans Upon\nadoption of the ASU on January 1, 2023, Citi discontinued the\nuse of a DCF approach for consumer loans formerly considered\nTDRs. Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi measures the ACLL for all\nconsumer loans under approaches that do not incorporate\ndiscounting, primarily utilizing models that consider the\nborrowers\u2019 probability of default, loss given default and\nexposure at default. In addition, upon adoption of the ASU, Citi\ncollectively evaluates smaller-balance homogeneous loans\nformerly considered TDRs for expected credit losses, whereas\npreviously those loans had been individually evaluated. The ASU\nalso requires disclosure of modifications of loans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty if the modification involves\nprincipal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-\nthan-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a\ncombination of those types of modifications. In addition, the\nASU requires the disclosure of current-period gross write-offs\nby year of loan origination (vintage). See Note 15 for these new\ndisclosures for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023.\n                              161                               \nLong-Duration Insurance Contracts In August 2018, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial Services\u2014Insurance: Targeted\nImprovements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts ,\nwhich changes the existing recognition, measurement,\npresentation and disclosures for long-duration contracts issued\nby an insurance entity. Specifically, the guidance (i) improves\nthe timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for\nfuture policy benefits and prescribes the rate used to discount\nfuture cash flows for long-duration insurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the accounting for certain market-based\noptions or guarantees associated with deposit (or account\nbalance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the amortization of\ndeferred acquisition costs, and (iv) introduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue long-\nduration insurance contracts such as traditional life insurance\npolicies and life-contingent annuity contracts that are impacted\nby the requirements of ASU 2018-12. Citi adopted the targeted\nimprovements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, resulting in a $\n39million decrease in Other liabilities and a $ 27million\nincrease in AOCI , after-tax. Fair Value Hedging\u2014Portfolio Layer\nMethod In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01,\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value\nHedging\u2014Portfolio Layer Method , intended to better align hedge\naccounting with an organization\u2019s risk management strategies.\nSpecifically, the guidance expands the current single-layer\nmethod to allow multiple hedge layers of a single closed\nportfolio of qualifying assets, which include both prepayable\nand non-prepayable assets. Upon the adoption of the guidance,\nentities may elect to reclassify securities held-to-maturity to\nthe available-for-sale category provided that the reclassified\nsecurities are designated in a portfolio hedge. Coincident with\nthe adoption of this ASU, on January 1, 2023, Citi transferred\nHTM mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost and fair\nvalue of approximately $ 3.3billion and $ 3.4billion,\nrespectively, into AFS as permitted under the guidance, and\nhedged them under the portfolio-layer method. Reference Rate\nReform On December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date\nof Topic 848 , which extends the period of time preparers can\nutilize the reference rate reform relief guidance. In 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting , which provides optional guidance to ease\nthe potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the\neffects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. In\n2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) delayed the\nintended cessation date of certain tenors of USD LIBOR to June\n30, 2023. To ensure that the relief in Topic 848 covers the\nperiod of time during which a significant number of\nmodifications may take place, the ASU defers the sunset date of\nTopic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The\nextension allows Citi to transition its remaining contracts and\nmaintain hedge accounting. The ASU was adopted by Citi upon\nissuance and did not impact financial results in 2022. Multiple\nMacroeconomic Scenarios-Based ACL Approach During the second\nquarter of 2022, Citi refined its ACL methodology to utilize\nmultiple macroeconomic scenarios to estimate its allowance for\ncredit losses. The ACL was previously estimated using a\ncombination of a single base-case forecast scenario as part of\nits quantitative component and a component of its qualitative\nmanagement adjustment that reflects economic uncertainty from\ndownside macroeconomic scenarios. As a result of this change,\nCiti now explicitly incorporates multiple macroeconomic\nscenarios\u2014base, upside, and downside\u2014and associated\nprobabilities in the quantitative component when estimating its\nACL, while still retaining certain of its qualitative management\nadjustments. This refinement represents a \u201cchange in accounting\nestimate\u201d under ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error\nCorrections , with prospective application beginning in the\nperiod of change. This change in accounting estimate resulted in\na decrease of approximately $ 0.3billion in the allowance for\ncredit losses in the second quarter of 2022, partially\noffsetting an increase of $ 0.8billion in the allowance for\ncredit losses due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and\nother factors in the second quarter of 2022. FUTURE ACCOUNTING\nCHANGES Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses In November\n2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income\nStatement\u2014Reporting Comprehensive Income\u2014Expense Disaggregation\nDisclosures (Subtopic 220-40) , to improve the disclosures of\nexpenses by requiring public business entities to provide\nfurther disaggregation of relevant expense captions (i.e.,\nemployee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset\namortization) in a separate note to the financial statements, a\nqualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant\nexpense captions that are not separately disaggregated\nquantitatively, and the total amount of selling expenses and, in\nan annual reporting period, an entity\u2019s definition of selling\nexpenses. The transition method is prospective with the\nretrospective method permitted, and the ASU will be effective\nfor Citi for its annual period ending December 31, 2027 and\ninterim periods for the interim period beginning January 1,\n2028. Citi is currently evaluating the impact on its\ndisclosures. Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets In\nDecember 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08,\nIntangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other\u2014Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60):\nAccounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , intended to\nimprove the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an\nentity to measure those assets at fair value each reporting\nperiod, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The\namendments also improve the information provided to investors\nabout an entity\u2019s crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure\nabout significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions and\nchanges during the reporting period. The guidance is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years with\n                              162                               \nearly adoption permitted. Citi\ndoes not hold any crypto\nassets within the scope of the\nguidance. Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income\nTax Disclosures In December\n2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income\nTax Disclosures , intended to\nenhance the transparency and\ndecision usefulness of income\ntax disclosures. This guidance\nrequires that public business\nentities disclose on an annual\nbasis a tabular rate\nreconciliation in eight\nspecific categories\ndisaggregated by nature and\nfor foreign tax effects by\neach jurisdiction that meets a\n5% of pretax income multiplied\nby the applicable statutory\ntax rate or greater threshold\nannually. The eight categories\ninclude state and local income\ntaxes, net of federal income\ntax effect; foreign tax\neffects; enactment of new tax\nlaws; enactment of new tax\ncredits; effect of cross-\nborder tax laws; valuation\nallowances; nontaxable items\nand nondeductible items; and\nchanges in unrecognized tax\nbenefits. Additional\ndisclosures include\nqualitative description of the\nstate and local jurisdictions\nthat contribute to the\nmajority (greater than 50%) of\nthe effect of the state and\nlocal income tax category and\nexplanation of the nature and\neffect of changes in\nindividual reconciling items.\nThe guidance also requires\nentities annually to disclose\nincome taxes paid (net of\nrefunds received)\ndisaggregated by federal,\nstate and foreign taxes and by\njurisdiction identified based\non the same 5% quantitative\nthreshold.\n\nThe standard is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. The\ntransition method is\nprospective with the\nretrospective method\npermitted. Citi plans to adopt\nthe ASU for the annual\nreporting period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2025, and is\ncurrently evaluating the\nimpact of the ASU on\ndisclosures.\n                              163                               \n2.

As a result, a CTA\npretax loss (net of hedges) in\nAOCI of approximately $\n400million ($ 345million\nafter-tax) was released to\nearnings in 2022 related to\nthe legacy operation. Out of\nthe total CTA release, a $\n260million pretax loss ($\n221million after-tax loss) was\nattributable to the Egg\nBanking business noted above,\nreported in Discontinued\noperations , and therefore the\ncorresponding CTA release was\nalso reported in Discontinued\noperations during 2022. The\nremaining CTA release of a $\n140million pretax loss ($\n124million after-tax loss)\nrelated to Legacy Holdings\nAssets was reported as part of\nContinuing operations within\nAll Other \u2014Legacy Franchises .\n\nWhile the legacy operation was\ndivested in multiple sales\nover the years, each\ntransaction did not result in\nsubstantial liquidation given\nthat Citi retained certain\nliabilities noted above. These\nliabilities were gradually\nsettled over time until\nreaching the point of\nsubstantial liquidation during\n2022, triggering the release\nof the CTA loss to earnings.\n\nCash flows from Discontinued\noperations were not material\nfor the periods presented.\n                              164                               \nSignificant Disposals\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, Citi had closed the sales of\nnineconsumer banking businesses within All Other \u2014Legacy\nFranchises: Australia closed in the second quarter of 2022, the\nPhilippines closed in the third quarter of 2022, Bahrain,\nMalaysia and Thailand closed in the fourth quarter of 2022,\nIndia and Vietnam closed in the first quarter of 2023, Taiwan\nclosed in the third quarter of 2023 and Indonesia closed in the\nfourth quarter of 2023.

The transaction generated a pretax loss on sale of\napproximately $ 768million ($ 644million after-tax), subject to\nclosing adjustments, recorded in Other revenue . The loss on\nsale primarily reflected the impact of an approximate pretax $\n620million CTA loss (net of hedges) ($ 470million after-tax)\nalready reflected in the AOCI component of equity. The sale\nclosed on June 1, 2022, and the CTA-related balance was removed\nfrom AOCI , resulting in a neutral CTA impact to Citi\u2019s CET1\nCapital.

Citi is organized into fivereportable operating\nsegments: Services , Markets , Banking , Wealth and U.S.\nPersonal Banking (USPB) , with the remaining operations recorded\nin All Other , which includes activities not assigned to a\nspecific reportable operating segment, as well as discontinued\noperations. Operating segment results have been revised to\nreflect the following changes: \u2022 Reallocated certain deposit\nbalances from Markets to All Other , to consolidate funding\nstrategies across the Company. This change had no material\nimpact to operating results of Markets or All Other. \u2022 Realigned\nbusinesses engaged in financing and securitization activities\nwithin Banking and Markets , transferred the retail banking\nbusiness in the U.K., which is being wound down, from Wealth to\nAll Other and made other immaterial reclassifications to align\nwith Citi\u2019s transformation and strategy. These reclassifications\ndid not materially change segment or All Other results, and\nprior periods were conformed to reflect these changes. \u2022\nReallocated certain customer balances between All Other\u2014 Legacy\nFranchises, Services , Markets and Banking in preparation for\nthe IPO of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM operations, and made other\nimmaterial reclassifications. These reallocations and\nreclassifications did not materially change segment or All Other\nresults, and prior periods were conformed to reflect these\nchanges. Citi\u2019s consolidated results remain unchanged for all\nperiods presented following the changes and reclassifications\ndiscussed above. All Other results are presented on a managed\nbasis that excludes divestiture-related impacts related to (i)\nCiti\u2019s divestitures of its Asia consumer banking businesses and\n(ii) the planned IPO of Mexico Consumer/SBMM within All Other\n\u2014Legacy Franchises. The managed basis presents investors with a\nview of operating earnings that provides increased transparency\nand clarity into the operational results of Citi\u2019s performance;\nimproves the visibility of management decisions and their\nimpacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to\npeer companies; and allows Citi to provide a long-term strategic\nview of the business going forward.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES; ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER FIDUCIARY FEES\n\nCommissions and Fees The primary components of Commissions and\nfees revenue are investment banking fees, brokerage commissions,\ncredit card and bank card income, deposit-related fees and\ntransactional service fees. Investment banking fees are\nsubstantially composed of underwriting and advisory revenues.\nSuch fees are recognized at the point in time when Citigroup\u2019s\nperformance under the terms of a contractual arrangement is\ncompleted, which is typically at the closing of a transaction.\nReimbursed expenses related to these transactions are recorded\nas revenue and are included within investment banking fees. In\ncertain instances for advisory contracts, Citi will receive\namounts in advance of the deal\u2019s closing. In these instances,\nthe amounts received will be recognized as a liability and not\nrecognized in revenue until the transaction closes. Investment\nbanking fees are earned primarily by Banking and Markets . See\nNote 3 for segment results. Out-of-pocket expenses associated\nwith underwriting activity are deferred and recognized at the\ntime the related revenue is recognized, while out-of-pocket\nexpenses associated with advisory arrangements are expensed as\nincurred. In general, expenses incurred related to investment\nbanking transactions, whether consummated or not, are recorded\nin Other operating expenses. The Company has determined that it\nacts as principal in the majority of these transactions and\ntherefore presents expenses gross within Other operating\nexpenses. Brokerage commissions primarily include commissions\nand fees from the following: executing transactions for clients\non exchanges and over-the-counter markets; sales of mutual funds\nand other annuity products; and assisting clients in clearing\ntransactions, providing brokerage services and other such\nactivities. Brokerage commissions are recognized in Commissions\nand fees at the point in time the associated service is\nfulfilled, generally on the trade execution date. Certain costs\npaid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges are recorded\nnet against commission revenue, as the Company is an agent for\nthose services. Sales of certain investment products include a\nportion of variable consideration associated with the underlying\nproduct. In these instances, a portion of the revenue associated\nwith the sale of the product is not recognized until the\nvariable consideration becomes fixed and determinable. Brokerage\ncommissions are earned primarily by Markets and USPB . See Note\n3 for segment results. Credit card and bank card income is\nprimarily composed of interchange fees, which are earned by card\nissuers based on card spend volumes, and certain card fees,\nincluding annual fees. Costs related to customer reward programs\nand certain payments to partners (primarily based on program\nsales, profitability and customer acquisitions) are recorded as\na reduction of credit card and bank card income. Citi\u2019s credit\ncard programs have certain partner sharing agreements that vary\nby partner. These partner sharing agreements are subject to\ncontractually based performance thresholds that, if met, would\nrequire Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\n\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses, which,\nto the extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces\nCiti\u2019s liability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program\nyear, would generally result in lower payments to partners in\ntotal for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances,\nother partner payments are based on program sales and new\naccount acquisitions. Interchange revenues are recognized as\nearned on a daily basis when Citi\u2019s performance obligation to\ntransmit funds to the payment networks has been satisfied.\nAnnual card fees, net of origination costs, are deferred and\namortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Costs\nrelated to card reward programs are recognized when the rewards\nare earned by the cardholders. Payments to partners are\nrecognized when incurred. Credit card and bank card income is\nearned primarily by Wealth and Services . See Note 3 for segment\nresults. Deposit-related fees consist of service charges on\ndeposit accounts and fees earned from performing cash management\nactivities and other deposit account services. Such fees are\nrecognized in the period in which the related service is\nprovided. Deposit-related fees are earned primarily by Services\nand USPB . See Note 3 for segment results. Transactional service\nfees primarily consist of fees charged for processing services\nsuch as cash management, global payments, clearing,\ninternational funds transfer and other trade services. Such fees\nare recognized as/when the associated service is satisfied,\nwhich normally occurs at the point in time the service is\nrequested by the customer and provided by Citi. Transactional\nservice fees are earned primarily by Services. See Note 3 for\nsegment results. Insurance distribution revenue consists of\ncommissions earned from third-party insurance companies for\nmarketing and selling insurance policies on behalf of such\nentities. Such commissions are recognized in Commissions and\nfees at the point in time the associated service is fulfilled,\ngenerally when the insurance policy is sold to the policyholder.\nSales of certain insurance products include a portion of\nvariable consideration associated with the underlying product.\nIn these instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the\nsale of the policy is not recognized until the variable\nconsideration becomes fixed and determinable. The Company\nrecognized $ 165million, $ 188million and $ 201million of\nrevenue related to such variable consideration for the years\nended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The custody product is composed of numerous\nservices related to the administration, safekeeping and\nreporting for both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The\nservices offered to clients include trade settlement,\nsafekeeping, income collection, corporate action notification,\nrecord-keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management.\nThese services are provided for a wide range of securities,\nincluding but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate\nbonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market\ninstruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative\ninstruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and precious\nmetals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the associated\nservice is satisfied, which normally occurs at the point in time\nthe service is requested by the customer and provided by Citi.\nCustody fees are earned primarily by Services . See Note 3 for\nsegment results. Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and\ninvestment management services. As an escrow agent, Citi\nreceives, safekeeps, services and manages clients\u2019 escrowed\nassets, such as cash, securities, property (including\nintellectual property), contracts or other collateral. Citi\nperforms its escrow agent duties by safekeeping the assets\nduring the specified time period agreed upon by all parties and\ntherefore earns its revenue evenly during the contract duration.\nInvestment management services consist of managing assets on\nbehalf of Citi\u2019s retail and institutional clients. Revenue from\nthese services primarily consists of asset-based fees for\nadvisory accounts, which are based on the market value of the\nclient\u2019s assets and recognized monthly, when the market value is\nfixed. In some instances, the Company contracts with third-party\nadvisors and with third-party custodians. The Company has\ndetermined that it acts as principal in the majority of these\ntransactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to third\nparties gross within Transactional and tax charges . Fiduciary\nfees are earned primarily by USPB and Legacy Franchises within\nAll Other .

INCENTIVE PLANS\nDiscretionary Annual Incentive\nAwards Citigroup grants\nimmediate cash bonus payments\nand various forms of immediate\nand deferred awards as part of\nits discretionary annual\nincentive award program\ninvolving a large segment of\nCitigroup\u2019s employees\nworldwide. Discretionary\nannual incentive awards are\ngenerally awarded in the first\nquarter of the year based on\nthe previous year\u2019s\nperformance. Awards valued at\nless than U.S. $ 75,000(or the\nlocal currency equivalent) are\ngenerally paid entirely in the\nform of an immediate cash\nbonus. Pursuant to Citigroup\npolicy and/or regulatory\nrequirements, certain\nemployees are subject to\nmandatory deferrals of\nincentive pay and generally\nreceive 15%\u2013 60% of their\nawards in the form of deferred\nstock or deferred cash stock\nunits. Discretionary annual\nincentive awards to certain\nemployees in the EU are\nsubject to deferral\nrequirements regardless of the\ntotal award value, with at\nleast 50% of the immediate\nincentive delivered in the\nform of a stock payment award\nsubject to a restriction on\nsale or transfer (generally,\nfor 12months). For deferred\nincentive awards granted in\n2022 and after, Citigroup\nchanged the annual deferred\ncompensation structure from\ngranting deferred cash awards\nfor certain regulated\nemployees to deferred stock\nawards. Certain employees\nlocated in countries that have\nregulations or tax advantages\nfor offering deferred cash or\ndeferred cash stock units\nreceived those types of awards\nas a part of their annual\nincentive compensation rather\nthan deferred stock. Subject\nto certain exceptions\n(principally, for retirement-\neligible employees),\ncontinuous employment within\nCitigroup is required to vest\nin deferred annual incentive\nawards. Post employment\nvesting by retirement-eligible\nemployees and participants who\nmeet other conditions is\ngenerally conditioned upon\ntheir compliance with certain\nrestrictions during the\nremaining vesting period.\nGenerally, the deferred awards\nvest in equal annual\ninstallments over four years.\nVested stock awards are\ndelivered in shares of common\nstock. Deferred cash awards\nare payable in cash and,\nexcept as prohibited by\napplicable regulatory\nguidance, earn a fixed\nnotional rate of interest that\nis paid only if and when the\nunderlying principal award\namount vests. Deferred cash\nstock unit awards are payable\nin cash at the vesting value\nof the underlying stock. The\nvalue of each deferred stock\nunit is equal to one share of\nCitigroup stock, and the award\nwill fluctuate with changes in\nthe stock price. Recipients of\ndeferred stock awards and\ndeferred cash stock unit\nawards, however, may, except\nas prohibited by applicable\nregulatory guidance, be\nentitled to receive or accrue\ndividend-equivalent payments\nduring the vesting period.\nGenerally, in the EU, vested\nshares are subject to a\nrestriction on sale or\ntransfer after vesting, and\nvested deferred cash awards\nand deferred cash stock units\nare subject to hold back\n(generally, for 6or 12months\nbased on the award type).\nStock awards, deferred cash\nstock units and deferred cash\nawards are subject to one or\nmore cancellation and clawback\nprovisions that apply in\ncertain circumstances,\nincluding gross misconduct and\nin the circumstances required\nby SEC rule 10D-1.\n\nOutstanding (Unvested) Stock\nAwards\nA summary of the status of unvested stock awards granted as\ndiscretionary annual incentive or sign-on and replacement stock\nawards is presented below:\n                                                                \n                                                     Weighted-  \n                                                 average\u00a0grant  \n                                                     date\u00a0fair  \n  Unvested\u00a0stock\u00a0awards           Shares       value per share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unvested at December\u00a0       59,857,333    $            56.09  \n  31, 2023                                                      \n  Granted(1)                  32,164,458                 53.00  \n  Canceled                    -2,693,522                 55.04  \n  Vested(2)                  -21,641,734                 58.59  \n  Unvested at December\u00a0       67,686,535    $            53.87  \n  31, 2024                                                      \n                                                                \n(1) The weighted-average fair value of the shares granted during\n2023 and 2022 was $ 49.36and $ 65.07, respectively.\n(2) The total fair value of stock awards that vested during the\nyears ending 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $ 1.1billion, $ 835million\nand $ 863million, respectively.\nTotal unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to\nunvested stock awards was $\n1.1billion at December 31,\n2024. The cost is expected to\nbe recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of 1.7years.\nPerformance Share Units\nCertain senior executives were\nawarded performance share\nunits (PSUs) every February\nfrom 2021 to 2024, for\nperformance in the year prior\nto the award date. Each award\nreferenced two forward-looking\nthree-year performance\nmetrics. In each year an award\nwas granted, the metrics were\nequally weighted. For PSUs\nawarded in 2021, 2022 and\n2023, the metrics were average\nreturn on tangible common\nequity and cumulative tangible\nbook value per share. For PSUs\nawarded in 2024, the metrics\nwere weighted-average return\non tangible common equity and\ncumulative tangible book value\nper share. The award is\nsettled solely in cash after\nthe end of each performance\nperiod. For all award years,\nif the total shareholder\nreturn is negative over the\nthree-yearperformance period,\nexecutives may earn no more\nthan 100% of the target PSUs,\nregardless of the extent to\nwhich Citigroup outperforms\nagainst performance goals\nand/or peer firms. The number\nof PSUs ultimately earned\ncould vary from zero, if\nperformance goals are not met,\nto as much as 150% of target,\nif performance goals are\nmeaningfully exceeded. The\nreported financial metrics\nduring the performance period\nare adjusted to reflect any\nmandatory equitable\nadjustments as required under\nthe applicable award\nagreements for unusual and\nnon-recurring items as\npresented to and approved by\nthe Compensation, Performance\nManagement and Culture (CPC)\nCommittee. For all award\nyears, the value of each PSU\nis equal to the value of\noneshare of Citi common stock.\nDividend equivalents are\nforfeitable, accrued and paid\non the number of earned PSUs\nafter the end of the\nperformance period.\n                              177                               \nPSUs are subject to variable\naccounting, pursuant to which\nthe associated value of the\naward will fluctuate with\nchanges in Citigroup\u2019s stock\nprice and the attainment of\nthe specified performance\ngoals for each award. The\nvalue of the award, subject to\nthe performance goals and\ntaking into account any\nmandatory equitable\nadjustments as per the terms\nof the award agreement, is\nestimated using a simulation\nmodel that incorporates\nmultiple valuation\nassumptions, including the\nprobability of achieving the\nspecified performance goals of\neach award. The risk-free rate\nused in the model is based on\nthe applicable U.S. Treasury\nyield curve. Other significant\nassumptions for the awards are\nas follows:\n                                                                \n  Valuation                                                     \n  assumptions\u2014weighted         2024        2023        2022     \n  average                                                       \n  Expected volatility         26.82  %    35.97  %    37.01  %  \n  Expected dividend yield      3.84        4.13        2.96     \n                                                                \nA summary of the performance\nshare unit activity for 2024\nis presented below:\n                                               \n  Performance share units               Units  \n  Outstanding, beginning of year    2,043,156  \n  Granted                           1,234,835  \n  Canceled                                  \u2014  \n  Payments(1)                        -418,098  \n  Outstanding, end of year          2,859,893  \n                                               \n(1) $ 24.6million in payments were processed for this program in\n2024.\n\nTransformation Program In order to provide an incentive for\nselect employees to effectively execute Citi\u2019s transformation\nprogram, in August 2021 the Personnel and Compensation (P&C)\nCommittee of Citigroup\u2019s Board of Directors, the predecessor of\nthe Compensation, Performance Management and Culture (CPC)\nCommittee of Citigroup\u2019s Board of Directors, approved a program\nfor the select employees to earn additional compensation based\non the achievement of Citi\u2019s transformation goals from August\n2021 through December 2024 and satisfaction of other conditions.\nPerformance under the program is divided into threeconsecutive\nperiods, ending on December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. The awards\nare subject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the\nassociated value of the award will fluctuate with the attainment\nof the performance conditions for each tranche and changes to\nCitigroup\u2019s stock price for the third tranche. Payment for each\nperiod will be in cash, in a lump sum, with the third payment\nindexed to changes in the value of Citi\u2019s common stock from the\nservice inception date through the payment date. Earnings\ngenerally will be based on collective performance with respect\nto Citi\u2019s transformation goals and will be evaluated and\napproved by the CPC Committee on an annual basis. Payments in\nthe event of any category of employment termination or change in\njob title or employment status are subject to Citi\u2019s discretion.\nCancellation and clawback are provided for in the event of\nmisconduct and certain other\n\ncircumstances. The program applies to senior leaders, other than\nthe CEO, critical to helping deliver a successful transformation\nwith the value of the awards varying based on individual\ncompensation levels. Other Variable Incentive Compensation\nCitigroup has various incentive plans globally that are used to\nmotivate and reward performance primarily in the areas of sales,\noperational excellence and customer satisfaction. Participation\nin these plans is generally limited to employees who are not\neligible for discretionary annual incentive awards. Other forms\nof variable compensation include commissions paid to financial\nadvisors and mortgage loan officers. Additional Information\nExcept for awards subject to variable accounting, the total\nexpense recognized for stock awards represents the grant date\nfair value of such awards, which is generally recognized as a\ncharge to income ratably over the vesting period, other than for\nawards to retirement-eligible employees and immediately vested\nawards. Whenever awards are granted or are expected to be\ngranted to employees who are, or are expected to be while the\nawards are outstanding, retirement eligible, the charge to\nincome is accelerated based on when the applicable conditions\nfor retirement eligibility were or will be met. If the employee\nis retirement eligible on the grant date, or the award is vested\nat the grant date, Citi recognizes the expense each year equal\nto the grant date fair value of the awards that it estimates\nwill be granted in the following year. Recipients of Citigroup\nstock awards generally do not have any stockholder rights until\nshares are delivered upon vesting. Recipients of stock-settled\nawards and other vested stock awards subject to a sale-\nrestriction period are generally entitled to vote the shares in\ntheir award and receive dividends on such shares during the\nsale-restriction period. Once a stock award vests, the shares\ndelivered to the participant are freely transferable, unless\nthey are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer for a\nspecified period. All equity awards granted since April 19, 2005\nhave been made pursuant to stockholder-approved stock incentive\nplans that are administered by the CPC Committee (or its\npredecessor), which is composed entirely of independent non-\nemployee directors. On December 31, 2024, approximately\n42.3million shares of Citigroup common stock were authorized and\navailable for grant under Citigroup\u2019s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan,\nthe only plan from which equity awards are currently granted.\nThe 2019 Stock Incentive Plan and predecessor plans permit the\nuse of treasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with\nawards granted under the plans. Except where local laws favor\nnewly issued shares, treasury shares were used to settle stock\nvestings. The use of treasury stock or newly issued shares to\nsettle stock awards does not affect the compensation expense\nrecorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income for equity\nawards.\n                              178                               \nIncentive Compensation Cost\nThe following table presents\ncomponents of compensation\nexpense, relating to the\nincentive compensation\nprograms described above:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0dollars          2024        2023        2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Charges for estimated                                         \n  awards to                   $    741    $    663    $    742  \n  retirement-eligible                                           \n  employees                                                     \n  Amortization of deferred                                      \n  cash awards,                                                  \n  deferred cash stock              186         340         463  \n  units and                                                     \n  performance stock units                                       \n  Immediately vested stock                                      \n  award                            130         127         101  \n  expense(1)                                                    \n  Amortization of                                               \n  restricted and deferred          718         689         533  \n  stock awards(2)                                               \n  Other variable incentive         355         286         304  \n  compensation                                                  \n  Total                       $  2,130    $  2,105    $  2,091  \n                                                                \n(1) Represents expense for\nimmediately vested stock\nawards that generally were\nstock payments in lieu of cash\ncompensation.

Accordingly, no\nadditional compensation-based contributions have been credited\nto the cash balance portion of the plan for existing plan\nparticipants after 2007. However, certain employees covered\nunder the prior final pay plan formula continue to accrue\nbenefits.

Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s Significant Plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n(2) Curtailment and settlement relate to divestiture and other\nwind-down activities.\n(3) The U.S. qualified plan was fully funded as of January 1,\n2024 and no minimum funding was required for 2024.

Changes in one or a\ncombination of these assumptions will have an impact on the\nCompany\u2019s pension and postretirement PBO, funded status and\nexpense (benefit). Changes in the plans\u2019 funded status resulting\nfrom changes in the PBO and fair value of plan assets will have\na corresponding impact on AOCI . The actuarial assumptions at\nthe respective years ended December 31 in the table below are\nused to measure the year-end PBO and the net periodic expense\n(benefit) for the subsequent year (period). Since Citi\u2019s\nSignificant Plans are measured on a quarterly basis, the year-\nend rates for those plans are used to calculate the net periodic\nexpense (benefit) for the subsequent year\u2019s first quarter. As a\nresult of the quarterly measurement process, the net periodic\n(benefit) expense for the Significant Plans is calculated at\neach respective quarter end based on the preceding quarter-end\nrates (as presented below for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension and\npostretirement benefit plans). The actuarial assumptions for All\nOther Plans are measured annually.\n                              182                               \nCertain assumptions used in determining pension and\npostretirement benefit obligations and net benefit expense for\nthe Company\u2019s plans are presented in the following tables:\n                                                                \n  At\u00a0year\u00a0end                              2024           2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Discount rate                                                 \n  U.S. plans                                                    \n  Qualified pension                       5.55%          5.10%  \n  Nonqualified pension                     5.60           5.15  \n  Postretirement benefit plan              5.55           5.20  \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range                             0.85to12.50    1.35to14.55  \n  Weighted average                         7.31           6.91  \n  Non-U.S. postretirement                                       \n  benefit plan                                                  \n  Range                             3.25to12.20    3.80to10.70  \n  Weighted average                        11.21           9.90  \n  Future compensation increase                                  \n  rate(1)                                                       \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range                             1.60to12.40    1.30to12.40  \n  Weighted average                         3.80           3.84  \n  Expected return on assets                                     \n  U.S. plans                                                    \n  Qualified pension                        6.00           5.70  \n  Postretirement benefit plan(2)      6.00/3.00      5.70/3.00  \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range                             2.00to11.50    2.00to11.50  \n  Weighted average                         6.27           6.62  \n  Non-U.S. postretirement                                       \n  benefit plan                                                  \n  Range                              8.60to9.40     8.60to9.40  \n  Weighted average                         9.39           9.39  \n  Interest crediting rate                                       \n  (weighted                                                     \n  average)(3)                                                   \n  U.S. plans                               4.55           4.10  \n  Non-U.S. plans                           1.77           1.78  \n                                                                \n(1) Not material for U.S.\nplans.

For the years 2024\nand 2023, the expected return\non assets for the VEBA Trust\nwas 3.00% and for 2022 it was\n1.50%. (5) The Company has\ncash balance plans and other\nplans with promised interest\ncrediting rates. For these\nplans, the interest crediting\nrates are set in line with\nplan rules or country\nlegislation .\n                              183                               \nDiscount Rate The discount rates for the U.S. pension and\npostretirement benefit plans were selected by reference to a\nCitigroup-specific analysis using each plan\u2019s specific cash\nflows and a hypothetical bond portfolio of U.S. high-quality\ncorporate bonds that match each plan\u2019s projected cash flows. The\ndiscount rates for the non-U.S. pension and postretirement\nbenefit plans are selected by reference to each plan\u2019s specific\ncash flows and a market-based yield curve developed from the\navailable local high-quality corporate bonds. However, where\ndeveloped corporate bond markets do not exist, the discount\nrates are selected by reference to local government bonds with\nan estimated premium added to reflect the additional risk for\ncorporate bonds in certain countries. Where available, the\nresulting plan yields by jurisdiction are compared with\npublished, high-quality corporate bond indices for\nreasonableness. Expected Return on Assets The Company determines\nits assumptions for the expected return on assets for its U.S.\npension and postretirement benefit plans using a \u201cbuilding\nblock\u201d approach, which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of\nreturn for each asset class. A weighted-average range of nominal\nrates is then determined based on target allocations to each\nasset class. Market performance over a number of earlier years\nis evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to\ndetermine whether there are sound reasons for projecting any\npast trends. The Company considers the expected return on assets\nto be a long-term assessment of return expectations and does not\nanticipate changing this assumption unless there are significant\nchanges in investment strategy or economic conditions. This\ncontrasts with the selection of the discount rate and certain\nother assumptions, which are reconsidered annually (or quarterly\nfor the Significant Plans) in accordance with GAAP. The expected\nreturn on assets reflects the expected annual appreciation of\nthe plan assets and reduces the Company\u2019s annual pension\nexpense. The expected return on assets is deducted from the sum\nof service cost, interest cost and other components of pension\nexpense to arrive at the net pension expense (benefit).\nThe following table presents\nthe expected return on assets\nused in determining the\nCompany\u2019s pension expense\ncompared to the actual return\non assets during 2024, 2023\nand 2022 for the U.S. pension\nand postretirement benefit\nplans:\n                                                                \n  U.S. plans(during the year)          2024     2023      2022  \n  Expected return on assets(1)                                  \n  U.S. pension and postretirement     5.70%    5.70%     5.00%  \n  trust                                                         \n  VEBA Trust(2)                        3.00     3.00      1.50  \n  Actual return on assets(1)                                    \n  U.S. pension and postretirement      2.55     9.83    -15.52  \n  trust                                                         \n  VEBA Trust                           6.01     5.87      1.40  \n                                                                \n(1) Expected return on assets\nand actual return on assets is\npresented net of fees.\n(2) The expected return on\nassets for the VEBA Trust was\nadjusted from 1.50% to 3.00%\neffective January 1, 2023 to\nreflect the significant change\nin economic conditions.\nSensitivities of Certain Key\nAssumptions The U.S. Qualified\nPension Plan is frozen, and as\na result, pension expense is\nprimarily driven by interest\ncost. An increase in the\ndiscount rate would increase\npension expense, while a\ndecrease in the discount rate\nwould decrease pension\nexpense. For Non-U.S. Pension\nPlans that are not frozen (in\ncountries such as Mexico, the\nU.K. and South Korea), there\nis more service cost. The\npension expense for the\nNon-U.S. Plans is driven by\nboth service cost and interest\ncost. An increase in the\ndiscount rate generally\ndecreases pension expense due\nto the greater impact on\nservice cost compared to\ninterest cost.\nThe following tables summarize\nthe effect on pension

The investment\nstrategies are targeted to\nproduce a total return that,\nwhen combined with the\nCompany\u2019s contributions to the\nfunds, will maintain the\nfunds\u2019 ability to meet all\nrequired benefit obligations.\nRisk is controlled through\ndiversification of asset types\nand investments in domestic\nand international equities,\nfixed income securities and\ncash and short-term\ninvestments. The target asset\nallocation in most locations\noutside the U.S. is primarily\nin equity and debt securities.\nThese allocations may vary by\ngeographic region and country\ndepending on the nature of\napplicable obligations and\nvarious other regional\nconsiderations. The wide\nvariation in the actual range\nof plan asset allocations for\nthe funded non-U.S. plans is a\nresult of differing local\nstatutory requirements and\neconomic conditions. For\nexample, in certain countries\nlocal law requires that all\npension plan assets must be\ninvested in fixed income\ninvestments, government funds\nor local-country securities.\nSignificant Concentrations of\nRisk in Plan Assets The assets\nof the Company\u2019s pension plans\nare diversified to limit the\nimpact of any individual\ninvestment.

Citi was under audit by the Internal\nRevenue Service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the\nworld. It is thus reasonably possible that significant changes\nin the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur\nwithin the next 12 months. The potential range of amounts that\ncould affect Citi\u2019s effective tax rate is between $ 0and $\n500million.\nThe following are the major\ntax jurisdictions in which the\nCompany and its affiliates\noperate and the earliest tax\nyear subject to examination:\n                                             \n  Jurisdiction               Tax\u00a0year        \n  United States                        2016  \n  New York State and City              2009  \n  Brazil                               2022  \n  Hong Kong                            2023  \n  India                                2018  \n  Mexico                               2017  \n  Singapore                            2023  \n  United Kingdom                       2016  \n                                             \n                              193                               \nNon-U.S. Earnings Non-U.S. pretax earnings approximated $\n19.4billion in 2024, $ 19.4billion in 2023 and $ 16.2billion in\n2022. As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries\nare currently subject to U.S. taxation on all non-U.S. pretax\nearnings of non-U.S. branches. Beginning in 2018, there is a\nseparate foreign tax credit (FTC) basket for branches. Also,\ndividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary or affiliate are\neffectively exempt from U.S. taxation. The Company provides\nincome taxes on the book over tax basis differences of non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries except to the extent that such differences are\nindefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At December 31, 2024, $\n5.8billion of basis differences of non-U.S. entities was\nindefinitely reinvested. At the existing tax rates (including\nwithholding taxes), additional taxes (net of U.S. FTCs) of $\n2.3billion would have to be provided if such assertions were\nreversed. Deferred Tax Assets As of December 31, 2024, Citi had\na valuation allowance of $ 4.3billion, composed of valuation\nallowances of $ 3.3billion on its branch basket FTC carry-\nforwards, $ 0.6billion on its U.S. residual DTA related to its\nnon-U.S. branches, $ 0.3billion on local non-U.S. DTAs and $\n0.1billion on state net operating loss carry-forwards. There was\nan increase of $ 0.7billion from the December 31, 2023 balance\nof $ 3.6billion. The amount of Citi\u2019s valuation allowances (VA)\nmay change in future years. In 2024, Citi\u2019s VA for carry-forward\nFTCs in its branch basket increased by $ 1.4billion, primarily\ndue to the geographic mix of earnings in Citi\u2019s foreign branch\nnetwork. The level of branch pretax income, the local branch tax\nrate and the allocations of overall domestic losses (ODL) and\nexpenses for U.S. tax purposes to the branch basket are the main\nfactors in determining the branch VA. There was no branch basket\nVA release in 2024.\nThe following table summarizes\nCiti\u2019s DTAs:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0billions\u00a0of\u00a0

(2) Pretax.\nAlthough realization is not assured, Citi believes that the\nrealization of the recognized net DTAs of $ 29.8billion at\nDecember 31, 2024 is more-likely-than-not, based on expectations\nas to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise and consideration of available tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes ). The majority\nof Citi\u2019s U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forward and all\nof its New York State and City net operating loss carry-forwards\nare subject to a carry-forward period of 20years. This provides\nenough time to fully utilize the DTAs pertaining to these\nexisting NOL carry-forwards. This is due to Citi\u2019s forecast of\nsufficient U.S. taxable income and because New York State and\nCity continue to tax Citi\u2019s non-U.S. income. With respect to the\nFTCs component of the DTAs, the carry-forward period is 10years.\nUtilization of FTCs in any year is generally limited to 21% of\nforeign source taxable income in that year. However, ODL that\nCiti has incurred of approximately $ 9billion as of December 31,\n2024 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to\nthe extent of 50%\u2013 100% (at taxpayer\u2019s election) of domestic\nsource income produced in subsequent years. Such resulting\nforeign source income would help support the realization of the\nFTC carry-forwards after VA. As noted in the tables above,\nCiti\u2019s FTC carry-forwards were $ 0.7billion ($ 4.0billion before\nVA) as of December 31, 2024, compared to $ 1.2billion ($\n3.1billion before VA) as of December 31, 2023. The increased VA\non branch FTCs is reflected in the \u201cNon-U.S. income tax rate\ndifferential\u201d line in the \u201cTax Rate\u201d section above. Citi\nbelieves that it will more-likely-than-not generate sufficient\nU.S. taxable income within the 10-year carry-forward period to\nbe able to utilize the net FTCs after the VA, after considering\nany FTCs produced in the tax return for such period, which must\nbe used prior to any carry-forward utilization.\n                              195                               \n                                                                \n  11.

Transactions executed by Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing\nactivity.\n\nTo maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market\nconditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages\nthese activities by taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor. Citi\nmanages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions\nby conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in\ncapacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client\nactions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty\ndiversification by establishing concentration triggers and\nassessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.\n\nThe Company\u2019s policy is to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. For resale and\n\nrepurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts\nadditional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin\nprotection. Collateral typically consists of government and\ngovernment-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds,\nequities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. The\nresale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother type of default under the relevant master agreement.\nEvents of default generally include (i) failure to deliver cash\nor securities as required under the transaction, (ii) failure to\nprovide or return cash or securities as used for margining\npurposes, (iii) breach of representation, (iv) cross-default to\nanother transaction entered into among the parties, or, in some\ncases, their affiliates, and (v) a repudiation of obligations\nunder the agreement. The counterparty that receives the\nsecurities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in\nits use of the securities, with the exception of transactions\nexecuted on a tri-party basis, where the collateral is\nmaintained by a custodian and operational limitations may\nrestrict its use of the securities. A substantial portion of the\nresale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as\nthe Company elected the fair value option, as described in Notes\n26 and 27. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of\ncash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as\nspecified in the respective agreements. The securities borrowing\nand lending agreements also represent collateralized financing\ntransactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements.\nCollateral typically consists of government and government-\nagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities.\nSimilar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities\nborrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother default by the other party under the relevant master\nagreement. Events of default and rights to use securities under\nthe securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to\nthe resale and repurchase agreements referenced above. A\nsubstantial portion of securities borrowing and lending\nagreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 27. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The enforceability of offsetting\nrights incorporated in the master netting agreements for resale\nand repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending\nagreements,\n                              197                               \nis evidenced to the extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion\nhas been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that\nprovides the requisite level of certainty regarding the\nenforceability of these agreements and (ii) the exercise of\nrights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and close out\ntransactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be\nstayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default,\nincluding bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding. A legal\nopinion may not have been sought or obtained for certain\njurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently\nambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights\nor where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast\ndoubt on the enforceability of such rights. In some\njurisdictions and for some counterparty types, the insolvency\nlaw for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or\nunclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For example, this may\nbe the case for certain sovereigns, municipalities, central\nbanks and U.S. pension plans. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND\nBROKERAGE PAYABLES\n\nThe Company has receivables\nand payables for financial\ninstruments sold to and\npurchased from brokers,\ndealers and customers, which\narise in the ordinary course\nof business. Citi is exposed\nto risk of loss from the\ninability of brokers, dealers\nor customers to pay for\npurchases or to deliver the\nfinancial instruments sold, in\nwhich case Citi would have to\nsell or purchase the financial\ninstruments at prevailing\nmarket prices. Credit risk is\nreduced to the extent that an\nexchange or clearing\norganization acts as a\ncounterparty to the\ntransaction and replaces the\nbroker, dealer or customer in\nquestion.\n\nCiti seeks to protect itself\nfrom the risks associated with\ncustomer activities by\nrequiring customers to\nmaintain margin collateral in\ncompliance with regulatory and\ninternal guidelines. Margin\nlevels are monitored daily,\nand customers deposit\nadditional collateral as\nrequired. Where customers\ncannot meet collateral\nrequirements, Citi may\nliquidate sufficient\nunderlying financial\ninstruments to bring the\ncustomer into compliance with\nthe required margin level.\n\nExposure to credit risk is\nimpacted by market volatility,\nwhich may impair the ability\nof clients to satisfy their\nobligations to Citi. Credit\nlimits are established and\nclosely monitored for\ncustomers and for brokers and\ndealers engaged in forwards,\nfutures and other transactions\ndeemed to be credit sensitive.\nBrokerage receivables and\nBrokerage payables consisted\nof the following:\n                                                                \n                                     December 31,               \n  In millions of dollars                     2024         2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Receivables from customers      $        18,512    $  15,986  \n  Receivables from brokers,                                     \n  dealers and                              32,329       37,929  \n  clearing organizations                                        \n  Total brokerage                 $        50,841    $  53,915  \n  receivables(1)                                                \n  Payables to customers           $        51,993    $  49,206  \n  Payables to brokers, dealers                                  \n  and                                      14,608       14,333  \n  clearing organizations                                        \n  Total brokerage payables(1)     $        66,601    $  63,539  \n                                                                \n(1) Includes brokerage\nreceivables and payables\nrecorded by Citi broker-dealer\nentities that are accounted\nfor in accordance with the\nAICPA Accounting Guide for\nBrokers and Dealers in\nSecurities as codified in ASC\n940-320.\n                              200                               \n                                                                \n  14.

Upon adoption,\nCiti transferred $ 3.3billion (amortized cost) of mortgage-\nbacked securities from HTM classification to AFS classification\nas allowed under the ASU. At the time of transfer, the\nsecurities were in an unrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion,\nwhich was recorded in AOCI upon transfer . See Note 1.\nThe Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these\nsecurities to maturity or, where applicable, until the exercise\nof any issuer call option, absent any unforeseen significant\nchanges in circumstances, including deterioration in credit or\nchanges in regulatory capital requirements. The net unrealized\nlosses classified in AOCI for HTM debt securities primarily\nrelate to debt securities previously classified as AFS that were\ntransferred to HTM, and include any cumulative fair value hedge\nadjustments. The net unrealized loss amount also includes any\nnon-credit-related changes in fair value of HTM debt securities\nthat have suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings.

There were no purchased credit-deteriorated HTM debt\nsecurities held by the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n                              206                               \nEvaluating Investments for Impairment\u2014AFS Debt Securities\nOverview The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt\nsecurities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the\nimpairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other\nfactors and to evaluate the Company\u2019s intent to sell such\nsecurities. An AFS debt security is impaired when the current\nfair value of an individual AFS debt security is less than its\namortized cost basis. The Company recognizes the entire\ndifference between amortized cost basis and fair value in\nearnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has an\nintent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized\ncost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities that the\nCompany does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required\nto sell, only the credit-related impairment is recognized in\nearnings by recording an allowance for credit losses. Any\nremaining fair value decline for such securities is recorded in\nAOCI . The Company does not consider the length of time that the\nfair value of a security is below its amortized cost when\ndetermining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt securities,\ncredit losses exist where Citi does not expect to receive\ncontractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to\nrecover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under business policies. The sections\nbelow describe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected\ncredit impairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of December 31, 2024. Agency\nMortgage-Backed Securities Citi records no allowances for credit\nlosses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities, because the Company expects to incur no credit\nlosses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no\ncredit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties. State\nand Municipal Securities The process for estimating credit\nlosses in Citigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily\nbased on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit\nratings. Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers\nproviding default protection in the form of financial guarantee\ninsurance. The average external credit rating, disregarding any\ninsurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating\ndowngrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based\non instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of\nissuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for\nadverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of\nvalue, the full impairment is recognized in earnings. For AFS\nstate and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to sell and\nit is not more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required\nto sell, Citi records an allowance for expected credit losses\nfor the amount it expects not to collect, capped at the\ndifference between the bond\u2019s amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue.\n\nRecognition and Measurement of Impairment\nThe following table presents total impairment on AFS investments\nrecognized in earnings:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                         Year ended             \n  dollars                     2024             2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impairment losses                                             \n  recognized in                                                 \n  earnings                                                      \n  for debt securities                                           \n  that the Company                                              \n  intends to sell,                                              \n  would                    $   323    $         188    $   360  \n  more-likely-than-not                                          \n  be required to sell                                           \n  or will be subject to                                         \n  an issuer call                                                \n  deemed probable of                                            \n  exercise                                                      \n                                                                \n                              207                               \nAllowance for Credit Losses on AFS Debt Securities The allowance\nfor credit losses on AFS debt securities held that the Company\ndoes not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell was\n$ 6million and $ 8million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at\nFair Value Non-marketable equity securities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in\nearnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or\n(ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal\nHome Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to\nbe carried at cost. The election to measure a non-marketable\nequity security using the measurement alternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus\nchanges resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair\nvalue on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may\ndiffer from the observed transaction price due to a number of\nfactors, including marketability adjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for\nthe identical investment held by Citi. Equity securities under\nthe measurement alternative, which are composed of private\nequity investments, are also assessed for impairment. On a\nquarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each\nequity security under the measurement alternative is impaired.\nImpairment indicators that are considered include, but are not\nlimited to, the following: \u2022 a significant deterioration in the\nearnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or business\nprospects of the investee; \u2022 a significant adverse change in the\nregulatory, economic or technological environment of the\ninvestee; \u2022 a significant adverse change in the general market\ncondition of either the geographical area or the industry in\nwhich the investee operates; \u2022 a bona fide offer to purchase, an\noffer by the investee to sell or a completed auction process for\nthe same or similar investment for an amount less than the\ncarrying amount of that investment; and \u2022 factors that raise\nsignificant concerns about the investee\u2019s ability to continue as\na going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations,\nworking capital deficiencies or noncompliance with statutory\ncapital requirements or debt covenants. When the qualitative\nassessment indicates that the equity security is impaired, its\nfair value is determined. If the fair value of the investment is\nless than its carrying value, the investment is written down to\nfair value through earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023:\n                                                                \n  In millions of           December 31,           December 31,  \n  dollars                          2024                   2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value     $            1,574    $             1,639  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized\nin earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable\nequity securities measured\nusing the measurement\nalternative:\n                                                                \n                                Year ended December             \n  In millions of                                31,             \n  dollars                                      2024       2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative(1):                                               \n  Impairment losses       $                     108    $   135  \n  Downward changes for                            5         24  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                             84         87  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 26 for additional\ninformation on these\nnonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                     December 31, 2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                          438  \n  Downward changes for                                      38  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                     1,033  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

If the\ninvestee is not publicly\nlisted, other methods are used\n(see Note 26). For impaired\nequity method investments that\nCiti plans to sell prior to\nrecovery of value or would\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell, with no\nexpectation that the fair\nvalue will recover prior to\nthe expected sale date, the\nfull impairment is recognized\nas OTTI in Other revenue\nregardless of severity and\nduration. The measurement of\nthe OTTI does not include\npartial projected recoveries\nsubsequent to the balance\nsheet date.\n                              208                               \nFor impaired equity method\ninvestments that management\ndoes not plan to sell and is\nnot more-likely-than-not to be\nrequired to sell prior to\nrecovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an\nimpairment is other-than-\ntemporary is based on (i)\nwhether and when an equity\nmethod investment will recover\nin value and (ii) whether the\ninvestor has the intent and\nability to hold that\ninvestment for a period of\ntime sufficient to recover the\nvalue. The determination of\nwhether the impairment is\nconsidered other-than-\ntemporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the\ncause of the impairment and\nthe financial condition and\nnear-term prospects of the\nissuer, including any specific\nevents that may influence the\noperations of the issuer; \u2022\nthe intent and ability to hold\nthe investment for a period of\ntime sufficient to allow for\nany anticipated recovery in\nmarket value; and \u2022 the length\nof time and extent to which\nfair value has been less than\nthe carrying value.\n                              209                               \n15.

As part of its risk management process, Citi assigns\nnumeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on\nquantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and\nfacility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or\nmore often if material events related to the obligor or facility\nwarrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk ratings\ninclude financial condition of the obligor, qualitative\nassessment of management and strategy, amount and sources of\nrepayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee\narrangements, amount and type of any contingencies associated\nwith the obligor and the obligor\u2019s industry and geography. The\nobligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default\nprobabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges\nof loss norms, which are the product of the probability of\ndefault and the loss given default. The investment-grade rating\ncategories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as\ndefined by S&P and Moody\u2019s. Loans classified according to the\nbank regulatory definitions as special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful and loss will have risk ratings within the non-\ninvestment-grade categories.\n

The higher sale\nactivity in 2023 was primarily related to a larger mortgage\nportfolio sold.

These scores are\ncontinually updated by the agencies based on an individual\u2019s\ncredit actions (e.g., taking out a loan or missed or late\npayments). The following tables provide details on the FICO\nscores for Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-\nperiod receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are\nupdated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or,\notherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.\nLoans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have\nbeen updated with FICO scores as they become available. With\nrespect to Citi\u2019s consumer loan portfolio outside of the U.S. as\nof December 31, 2024 and 2023 ($ 72.5billion and $ 77.5billion,\nrespectively), various country-specific or regional credit risk\nmetrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are\nleveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality\nof customers (see \u201cConsumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North\nAmerica\u201d below). As a result, details of relevant credit quality\nindicators for those loans are not comparable to the below FICO\nscore distribution for the U.S. portfolio.\n

Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist credit card\nborrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering\nlong-term loan modification programs. These modifications\ngenerally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card,\nplacing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60\nmonths and canceling the customer\u2019s available line of credit.\nCiti also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working\nwith third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure\ncustomers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In certain situations, Citi\nmay forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower\npays a required amount. Residential Mortgages Citi utilizes a\nthird-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential\nmortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks\nto assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate\nreductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term\nextensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in\nforbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the\nend of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently\nmodifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi\nenters into a trial modification with the borrower, generally a\nthree-monthperiod during which the borrower makes monthly\npayments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon\nsuccessful completion of the trial period, and the borrower\u2019s\nformal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower\nenter into a permanent modification.

20,175million, a slight increase from $\n19,873million at December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting the\nimpact of macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate environment and growth in cards\nbalances. Consumer ACLL Citi\u2019s total consumer allowance for\ncredit losses on loans (ACLL) as of December 31, 2024 was $\n16,018million, an increase from $ 15,431million at December 31,\n2023. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of\nmacroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and\ninterest rate environment, as well as cards loan growth.\nCorporate ACLL Citi\u2019s total corporate ACLL as of December 31,\n2024 was $ 2,556million, a decrease from $ 2,714million at\nDecember 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by releases\nfor (i) specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable\nindustries and regions, and (ii) transfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S. banking law. ACLUC As of December 31,\n2024, Citi\u2019s total allowance for unfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC), included in Other liabilities , was $ 1,601million, a\ndecrease from $ 1,728million at December 31, 2023.

These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n                              243                               \n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 45.5billion and $\n6billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 824million and $\n282million in maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\n\nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain investment funds\nfor which the Company provides investment management services\nand personal estate trusts for which the Company provides\nadministrative, trustee and/or investment management services; \u2022\ncertain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the\nCompany provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no\ndecision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some\nof which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-\nrelated commitment. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions\nwas $ 8.1billion and $ 8.5billion, respectively (see Notes 15\nand 26); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the\nCompany holds securities in inventory, as these investments are\nmade on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and\nasset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 14 and\n26); \u2022 certain representations and warranties exposures in\nCitigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the\noriginal mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022\nVIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with\nthe Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. Consolidated VIEs The Company\nengages in on-balance sheet securitizations, which are\nsecuritizations that do not qualify for sales treatment; thus,\nthe assets remain on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any\nproceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities. In\ngeneral, the third-party investors in the obligations of\nconsolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to the assets of the\nrespective VIEs and do not have such recourse to the Company,\nexcept where Citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or\nis the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving\nthe VIE. Thus, Citigroup\u2019s maximum legal exposure to loss\nrelated to consolidated VIEs is significantly less than the\ncarrying value of the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding\nthird-party financing. Intercompany assets and liabilities are\nexcluded from Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets\nare restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral. The\ncash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay\ndown the associated liabilities, which are non-recourse to\nCiti\u2019s general assets. The asset balances for consolidated VIEs\nrepresent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the\nCompany. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or\nthe current fair value of the assets depending on the\nclassification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the\nassociated accounting model ascribed to that classification. The\nasset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has\nsignificant involvement represent the most current information\navailable to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances\nrepresent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments,\nunless fair value information is readily available to the\nCompany. The maximum funded exposure represents the balance\nsheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in the VIE. It\nreflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE,\nadjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments\nreceived. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases\nor declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized\nin earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions\nrepresents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including\nliquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the\nnotional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a\nvariable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has\nentered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that\nare not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest\nrate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the\npurchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or\ntotal return swap where the Company pays the total return on\ncertain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements\nare not included in the maximum exposure amounts.\n                              244                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs, which are included on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The assets include those assets that can only be\nused to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs and are in\nexcess of those obligations. In addition, the assets include\nthird-party assets of consolidated VIEs only and exclude\nintercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The\nliabilities include third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs\nonly and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in\nconsolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts where\ncreditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to the\ngeneral credit of Citigroup.\n

card\nreceivables through trusts established to purchase the\nreceivables. Citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on\na non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving\nsecuritizations: as customers pay their credit card balances,\nthe cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and\nreplenish the receivables in the trust. The Company\u2019s primary\ncredit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial majority\nthrough the Master Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities\nbecause, as servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts. Citigroup holds a seller\u2019s interest\nand certain securities issued by the trusts, which could result\nin exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from\nthe trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables\nremain on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet with nogain or loss\nrecognized.

These certificates have the same life as the\ntransferred assets. In addition to providing a source of\nliquidity and less expensive funding, securitizing these assets\nalso reduces Citi\u2019s credit exposure to the borrowers. These\nmortgage loan securitizations are primarily non-recourse,\nthereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit\nlosses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust.\nCiti\u2019s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the\nservicing rights and in certain instances retains investment\nsecurities, interest-only strips and residual interests in\nfuture cash flows from the trusts and also provides servicing\nfor a limited number of Services , Markets and Banking\nsecuritizations. Citi\u2019s Services , Markets and Banking\nbusinesses may hold investment securities pursuant to credit\nrisk retention rules or in connection with secondary market-\nmaking activities. The Company securitizes mortgage loans\ngenerally through either a U.S. government-sponsored agency,\nsuch as Ginnie Mae, a U.S. agency-sponsored entity, such as\nFannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or a private label (non-agency-\nsponsored mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the primary\nbeneficiary of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization\nentities because Citigroup does not have the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the\nentities\u2019 economic performance. Therefore, Citi does not\nconsolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage securitization\nentities. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or\nsecuritized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are\nU.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in\nnon-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage securitization trusts\nare classified as Trading account assets , except for MSRs,\nwhich are included in Other assets on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Citigroup does not consolidate certain non-\nagency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities because Citi\nis either not the servicer with the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the entity or Citi is the servicer,\nbut the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary\nrelationship; therefore, Citi is not deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary of the entity. In certain instances, the Company has\n(i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly\nimpact the entities\u2019 economic performance and (ii) the\nobligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive\nbenefits that could be potentially significant to its non-\nagency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities and,\ntherefore, is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates\nthe VIE.\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information\nand retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage\nsecuritizations:\n                                                                \n          2\u2026                20\u2026                20\u2026              \n  \u2026       U\u2026                U.\u2026                U.\u2026              \n  \u2026       a\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026     \n  \u2026       s\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026     \n  \u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  8\u2026    $  9\u2026    $  4.9    $  4\u2026    $  6.9    $  1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       8\u2026       8\u2026       4.9       3\u2026       6.7       1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       0.1        \u2014       0.1           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026        \u2014       0\u2026         \u2014       0\u2026         \u2014       0\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014         \u2014        \u2014       0.1           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n                                                                \nNote: Excludes re-securitization transactions.\nFor non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities where the\ntransfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for sale\naccounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the\ndifference between the carrying value of the transferred assets\nand the proceeds received (generally cash but may be beneficial\ninterests or servicing rights).

quarter\nof 2023, Citi relaunched a\nprogram securitizing other\nconsumer loans into asset-\nbacked securities. The\nprincipal securitized and the\nproceeds from new\nsecuritizations for the year\nended December 31, 2024 were $\n1.2billion and $ 1.2billion,\nrespectively, compared to $\n1billion and $ 0.7billion,\nrespectively, as of December\n31, 2023. The gains recognized\non the securitization of\nconsumer loans were $\n5.1million and $ 7.5million\nfor the years ended December\n31, 2024 and 2023. Mortgage\nServicing Rights (MSRs) In\nconnection with the\nsecuritization of mortgage\nloans, Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer\nmortgage business generally\nretains the servicing rights,\nwhich entitle the Company to a\nfuture stream of cash flows\nbased on the outstanding\nprincipal balances of the\nloans and the contractual\nservicing fee. Failure to\nservice the loans in\naccordance with contractual\nrequirements may lead to a\ntermination of the servicing\nrights and the loss of future\nservicing fees. These\ntransactions create intangible\nassets referred to as MSRs,\nwhich are recorded at fair\nvalue on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet (see Note 26 for\nthe valuation of MSRs). The\nMSRs correspond to principal\nloan balances of $ 56billion\nand $ 52billion as of December\n31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nThe Company receives fees\nduring the course of servicing\npreviously securitized\nmortgages.

Re-securitizations The\nCompany engages in re-securitization transactions backed by\neither residential or commercial mortgages in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private\nlabel) securities to re-securitization entities, nor did Citi\nhold retained interests in such securitizations during the years\nended December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and\n2023, Citi held no retained interests in private label re-\nsecuritization transactions structured by Citi. The Company also\nre-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During the years ended December 31, 2024\nand 2023, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value\nof approximately $ 22.8billion and $ 17.1billion, respectively,\nto re-securitization entities. As of December 31, 2024, the fair\nvalue of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization\ntransactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $\n1.6billion (including $ 977million related to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2024),\n\ncompared to $ 1.7billion as of December 31, 2023 (including $\n930million related to re-securitization transactions executed in\n2023), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The\noriginal fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained interest as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023 were approximately $ 76.8billion and $ 84.1billion,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did\nnot consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization\nentities. Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper\nConduits Citi\u2019s multi-seller commercial paper conduits provide\nthe Company\u2019s clients access to low-cost funding in the\ncommercial paper markets. The conduits provide financing\nfacilities to clients that are funded by issuing commercial\npaper to third-party investors. As administrator to Citi\u2019s\nconduits, the Company is responsible for selecting and\nstructuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits, making\ndecisions regarding the funding of the conduits, including\ndetermining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper\nissued, monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits\u2019\nassets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the\nconduits. In return, the Company earns structuring fees from\ncustomers for individual transactions and earns an\nadministration fee from the conduit. The assets are privately\nnegotiated and structured transactions that are generally\ndesigned to be held by the conduit, rather than actively traded\nand sold. The yield earned by the conduit on each asset is\ngenerally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the\nconduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the client. Each\nasset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-\nspecific credit enhancement features provided by the third-party\nclient, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread\ncollateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees.\nThese credit enhancements are sized with the objective of\napproximating a credit rating of A or above, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the\ncommercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately\n$ 21.3billion and $ 21.1billion of purchased assets outstanding,\nand unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $\n16.7billion and $ 16.7billion, respectively. At December 31,\n2024 and 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturities of the\ncommercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately 82and\n68days, respectively. The conduits have obtained letters of\ncredit from the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the\nconduit\u2019s assets with a minimum of $ 200million to $ 350million.\nThe letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits\ntotal approximately $ 2.1billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n2.1billion as of December 31, 2023. In the event that defaulted\nassets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement\ndescribed above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first\nto the Company and then to the commercial paper investors.\nCitigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity\nagreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in\nthe event of a market disruption, among other events. Each asset\nof the conduits is supported by a\n                              251                               \ntransaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset\npurchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has\ngenerally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables\nfrom the conduit at par. The APA generally does not permit the\npurchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any funding under the\nAPA will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to\nincreased interest costs. In addition, the Company provides the\nconduits with program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term\nlending commitments, where the Company has agreed to lend to the\nconduits in the event of a short-term disruption in the\ncommercial paper market, subject to specified conditions. In the\nnormal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper,\nincluding commercial paper issued by Citigroup\u2019s conduits. At\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company owned $ 6.4billion and $\n10.1billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits. The Company\u2019s investments were not driven\nby market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any\nagreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the\nconduits. The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are\nconsolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, through\nits roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has both\nthe power to direct the activities that most significantly\nimpact the entities\u2019 economic performance and an economic\ninterest that could potentially be significant. No assets of any\nconduit are available to satisfy the creditors of Citigroup or\nany of its other subsidiaries. Collateralized Loan Obligations\n(CLOs) A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a VIE that\npurchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of non-\ninvestment-grade corporate loans, financed through the issuance\nof multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors. A third-\nparty asset manager is contracted by the CLO to purchase the\nunderlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit\nrisk associated with those assets. Over the term of a CLO, the\nasset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner\nconsistent with the CLO\u2019s asset management agreement and\nindenture. Citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with\nrespect to certain CLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the\nCLOs are sold to third-party investors. On occasion, certain\nCiti entities may purchase some portion of a CLO\u2019s liabilities\nfor investment purposes. In addition, Citi may purchase,\ntypically in the secondary market, certain securities issued by\nthe CLOs to support its market-making activities. The Company\ngenerally does not have the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic performance of the CLOs,\nas this power is generally held by a third-party asset manager\nof the CLO. As such, those CLOs are not consolidated.\nThe following tables summarize\nselected cash flow information\nand retained interests related\nto Citigroup CLOs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of dollars            2024       2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash flows received on                                        \n  retained                       $   0.3    $   0.1    $   0.3  \n  interests and other net                                       \n  cash flows                                                    \n  Purchases of previously                                       \n  transferred                          \u2014          \u2014          \u2014  \n  financial assets                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millions                                                      \n  of                Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,  \n  dollars               2024             2023             2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying                                                      \n  value of     $         275    $         604    $         681  \n  retained                                                      \n  interests                                                     \n                                                                \nAll of Citi\u2019s retained\ninterests were held-to-\nmaturity securities as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.\nMunicipal Securities Tender\nOption Bond (TOB) Trusts\nMunicipal TOB trusts may hold\nfixed- or floating-rate,\ntaxable or tax-exempt\nsecurities issued by state and\nlocal governments and\nmunicipalities. TOB trusts are\ntypically structured as\nsingle-issuer entities whose\nassets are purchased from\neither the Company or from\nother investors in the\nmunicipal securities market.\nTOB trusts finance the\npurchase of their municipal\nassets by issuing two classes\nof certificates: long-dated,\nfloating rate certificates\n(Floaters) that are putable\npursuant to a liquidity\nfacility and residual interest\ncertificates (Residuals). The\nFloaters are purchased by\nthird-party investors,\ntypically tax-exempt money\nmarket funds. The Residuals\nare purchased by the original\nowner of the municipal\nsecurities that are being\nfinanced. From Citigroup\u2019s\nperspective, there are\ntwotypes of TOB trusts:\ncustomer and non-customer.\nCustomer TOB trusts are those\ntrusts utilized by customers\nof the Company to finance\ntheir securities, generally\nmunicipal securities. The\nResiduals issued by these\ntrusts are purchased by the\ncustomer being financed. Non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are\ngenerally used by the Company\nto finance its own municipal\nsecurities investments; the\nResiduals issued by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are\npurchased by the Company. With\nrespect to both customer and\nnon-customer TOB trusts, Citi\nmay provide remarketing agent\nservices. If Floaters are\noptionally tendered, Citigroup\nmay, but is not obligated to,\npurchase the tendered Floaters\ninto its own inventory. The\nlevel of the Company\u2019s\ninventory of such Floaters\nfluctuates. For certain non-\ncustomer trusts, the Company\nalso provides credit\nenhancement. At December 31,\n2024, $0.4 billion of the\nmunicipal bonds owned by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts were\nsubject to a credit guarantee\nprovided by the Company. At\nDecember 31, 2023 none of the\nmunicipal bonds owned by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts were\nsubject to a credit guarantee\nprovided by the Company.\nCitigroup also provides\nliquidity services to many\ncustomer and non-customer\ntrusts. If a trust is unwound\nearly due to an event other\nthan a credit event on the\nunderlying municipal bonds,\nthe underlying municipal bonds\nare sold out of the trust and\nbond sale proceeds are used to\nredeem the outstanding trust\ncertificates. If this results\nin a shortfall between the\nbond sale proceeds and the\nredemption price of\n                              252                               \nthe tendered Floaters, the Company, pursuant to the liquidity\nagreement, would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to\nsatisfy that shortfall. For certain customer TOB trusts,\nCitigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the\nholder of the Residual, pursuant to which the Residual holder is\nobligated to reimburse the Company for any payment the Company\nmakes under the liquidity arrangement. These reimbursement\nagreements may be subject to daily margining based on changes in\nthe market value of the underlying municipal bonds. In cases\nwhere a third party provides liquidity to a non-customer TOB\ntrust, a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed,\nwhereby the Company (or a consolidated subsidiary of the\nCompany), as Residual holder, would absorb any losses incurred\nby the liquidity provider. For certain other non-customer TOB\ntrusts, Citi serves as tender option provider. The tender option\nprovider arrangement allows Floater holders to put their\ninterests directly to the Company at any time, subject to the\nrequisite notice period requirements, at a price of par. At\nDecember 31, 2024, the Company did not have any liquidity or\nreimbursement agreements. At December 31, 2023, liquidity\nagreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled\n$ 0.4billion, of which $ 0.3billion was offset by reimbursement\nagreements. Citi considers both customer and non-customer TOB\ntrusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB trusts are not consolidated by\nthe Company, as the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the trust\u2019s economic performance rests with\nthe customer Residual holder, who may unilaterally cause the\nsale of the trust\u2019s bonds. Non-customer TOB trusts generally are\nconsolidated because the Company holds the Residual interest and\nthus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trust\u2019s\nbonds. The Company also provides other liquidity agreements or\nletters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment\nfunds, which are not variable interest entities, and\nmunicipality-related issuers that totaled $ 0.5billion as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and $ 1.2billion as of December 31, 2023.\nThese liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by\nreimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.\nMunicipal Investments Municipal investment transactions include\ndebt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the\nconstruction and rehabilitation of low-income housing,\nfacilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the\nconstruction or operation of renewable municipal energy\nfacilities. Citi generally invests in these partnerships as a\nlimited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt\nof tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by\nthe partnership. The Company may also provide construction loans\nor permanent loans for the development or operation of real\nestate properties held by partnerships. These entities are\ngenerally considered VIEs. The power to direct the activities of\nthese entities is typically held by the general partner.\nAccordingly, these entities are not consolidated by Citigroup.\nClient Intermediation Client intermediation transactions\nrepresent a range of transactions designed to provide investors\nwith specified returns based on the returns of an underlying\nsecurity, referenced asset or index. These transactions include\ncredit-linked notes and equity-linked notes. In these\ntransactions, the VIE typically obtains exposure to the\nunderlying security, referenced asset or index through a\nderivative instrument, such as a total-return swap or a credit-\ndefault swap. In turn, the VIE issues notes to investors that\npay a return based on the specified underlying security,\nreferenced asset or index. The VIE invests the proceeds in a\nfinancial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves\nas collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the\ntransaction. The Company\u2019s involvement in these transactions\nincludes being the counterparty to the VIE\u2019s derivative\ninstruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by\nthe VIE. In certain transactions, the investor\u2019s maximum risk of\nloss is limited and the Company absorbs risk of loss above a\nspecified level. Citi does not have the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their\neconomic performance and thus it does not consolidate them.\nCiti\u2019s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as\nthe amount invested in notes issued by the VIE and the notional\namount of any risk of loss absorbed by Citi through a separate\ninstrument issued by the VIE. The derivative instrument held by\nthe Company may generate a receivable from the VIE (e.g., where\nthe Company purchases credit protection from the VIE in\nconnection with the VIE\u2019s issuance of a credit-linked note),\nwhich is collateralized by the assets owned by the VIE. These\nderivative instruments are not considered variable interests and\nany associated receivables are not included in the calculation\nof maximum exposure to the VIE. Investment Funds The Company is\nthe investment manager for certain investment funds and\nretirement funds that invest in various asset classes including\nprivate equity, hedge funds, real estate, fixed income and\ninfrastructure. Citigroup earns a management fee, which is a\npercentage of capital under management, and may earn performance\nfees. In addition, for some of these funds the Company has an\nownership interest in the investment funds. Citi has also\nestablished a number of investment funds as opportunities for\nqualified employees to invest in private equity investments. The\nCompany acts as investment manager for these funds and may\nprovide employees with financing on both recourse and non-\nrecourse bases for a portion of the employees\u2019 investment\ncommitments.\n                              253                               \nAsset-Based Financing\n\nThe Company provides loans and other forms of financing to VIEs\nthat hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same credit\napprovals as all other loans originated or purchased by the\nCompany. Financings in the form of debt securities or\nderivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading\naccount assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings.\nThe Company generally does not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact these VIEs\u2019 economic\nperformance; thus, it does not consolidate them.\n\nThe primary types of Citi\u2019s asset-based financings, total assets\nof the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss are presented below.

Futures contracts and other option\ncontracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an\nexchange with a CCP as the counterparty from the inception of\nthe transaction. Citigroup enters into derivative contracts\nrelating to interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and other\nmarket/credit risks for the following reasons: \u2022 Trading\nPurposes : Citigroup trades derivatives as an active market\nmaker. Citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection\nwith their risk management actions to transfer, modify or reduce\ntheir interest rate, foreign exchange and other market/credit\nrisks or for their own trading purposes. Citigroup also manages\nits derivative risk positions through offsetting trade\nactivities. \u2022 Hedging : Citigroup uses derivatives in connection\nwith its own risk management activities to hedge certain risks\nor reposition the risk profile of the Company. Hedging may be\naccomplished by applying hedge accounting in accordance with ASC\n815, Derivatives and Hedging . For example, Citigroup issues\nfixed-rate long-term debt and then enters into a receive-fixed,\npay-variable-rate interest rate swap with the same tenor and\nnotional amount to synthetically convert the interest payments\nto a net variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common\nform of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes net interest\ncost in certain yield curve environments. Derivatives are also\nused to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of on-\nbalance sheet assets and liabilities, including AFS securities,\ncommodities and borrowings, as well as other interest-sensitive\nassets and liabilities. In addition, foreign exchange contracts\nare used to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt, foreign\ncurrency-denominated AFS securities and net investment\nexposures.\n\nDerivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity\nrisks in excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative product is the\nexposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates,\nmarket prices, foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a\nfunction of the type of product, the volume of transactions, the\ntenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility.\nCredit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of\nnonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative\nliability where the value of any collateral held by Citi is not\nadequate to cover such losses. The recognition in earnings of\nunrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to\nmanagement\u2019s assessment of the probability of counterparty\ndefault. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises\nwhen the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to\nmonetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a\nreasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial\nstress. Derivative transactions are customarily documented under\nindustry standard master netting agreements, which provide that\nfollowing an event of default, the non-defaulting party may\npromptly terminate all transactions between the parties and\ndetermine the net obligation due to be paid to, or by, the\ndefaulting party. These net obligations under master netting\nagreements are often secured by collateral posted under an\nindustry standard credit support annex to the master netting\nagreement. The netting and collateral rights incorporated in the\nmaster netting agreements are considered to be legally\nenforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from\ncounsel of recognized standing that provides (i) the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding enforceability and (ii) that the\nexercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and\nclose-out transactions on a net basis under these agreements\nwill not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event\nof default, including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar\nproceeding. A legal opinion may not be sought for certain\njurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the\nenforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or\nconflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of\nsuch rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of\ncertainty. For example, this may be the case for certain\nsovereigns, municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension\nplans. Exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by\nmarket volatility, which may impair the ability of\ncounterparties to satisfy their obligations to the Company.\nCredit limits are established and closely monitored for\ncustomers engaged in derivatives transactions. Citi considers\nthe level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its\noffsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit\nsupport annexes to be an important factor in its risk management\nprocess. Specifically, Citi generally transacts much lower\nvolumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where\nCiti does not have the requisite level of legal certainty\nregarding enforceability, because such derivatives consume\ngreater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those\nexecuted under enforceable master netting agreements.\n                              255                               \nCash collateral and security collateral in the form of G10\ngovernment debt securities are often posted by a party to a\nmaster netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the\nother party; the receiving party is free to\ncommingle/rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course\nof its business. Nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds,\nmunicipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and/or MBS may also be\npledged as collateral for derivative transactions. Security\ncollateral posted to open and maintain a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty, in the form of cash and/or\nsecurities, may from time to time be segregated in an account at\na third-party custodian pursuant to a tri-party account control\nagreement. Information pertaining to Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table\nbelow. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from\nwhich contractual payments are derived and do not represent a\ncomplete measure of Citi\u2019s exposure to derivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure arises primarily from market\nfluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e.,\ncredit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial\nstress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation\nadjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover,\nnotional amounts presented below do not reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-\nfixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets\nthis risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with\na different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals\nis reported, although these offsetting positions may result in\nde minimis overall market risk. In addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period\nin the normal course of business based on Citi\u2019s market share,\nlevels of client activity and other factors. All derivatives are\nrecorded in Trading account assets/ Trading account liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n                              256                               \nDerivative

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk, and as a market-maker to facilitate client\ntransactions.\nThe following tables present the gross and net fair values of\nthe Company\u2019s derivative transactions and the related offsetting\namounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against gross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements.\nUnder ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or paid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support annex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security\ncollateral. In addition, the following tables reflect rule\nchanges adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow\nentities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as settlement of the related derivative\nfair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to\npresenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are\nsubject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables\nalso present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the\nCompany\u2019s balance sheet presentation, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians,\nbut which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an\nevent of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              257                               \nDerivative Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables\n

Credit Derivatives Citi\nis a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives.\nThrough these contracts, Citi either purchases or writes\nprotection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference\ncredits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate\ncredit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and\nother cash positions and to facilitate client transactions. Citi\nmanages counterparty credit risk arising from credit derivative\ncontracts primarily through master netting agreements,\ncollateral agreements and daily margin settlement requirements.\nA majority of Citi\u2019s top 15counterparties (by receivable balance\nowed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks, financial\ninstitutions or other dealers. Contracts with these\ncounterparties do not include ratings-based termination events.\nHowever, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental\neffect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may call for\nadditional collateral. The range of credit derivatives entered\ninto includes credit default swaps, total return swaps, credit\noptions and credit-linked notes. A credit default swap is a\ncontract in which, for a fee, a protection seller agrees to\nreimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a\npredefined credit event on a reference entity. These credit\nevents are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and\nthe reference entity and are generally limited to the market\nstandard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the\nreference entity and, in a more limited range of transactions,\ndebt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions that\nreference emerging market entities also typically include\nadditional credit events to cover the acceleration of\nindebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment\nmoratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided\non a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed securities.\nIf there is no credit event, as defined by the specific\nderivative contract, then the protection seller makes no\npayments to the protection buyer and receives only the\ncontractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs\nas defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the\nprotection seller will be required to make a payment to the\nprotection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of\nprotection may not be required to make a payment until a\nspecified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the\nportfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a\nspecified amount. A total return swap typically transfers the\ntotal economic performance of a reference asset, which includes\nall associated cash flows, as well as capital appreciation or\ndepreciation. The protection buyer receives a floating rate of\ninterest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the\nprotection seller and, in return, the protection seller receives\nthe cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any\nappreciation. Thus, according to the total return swap\nagreement, the protection seller will be obligated to make a\npayment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any\ndepreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows\nassociated with the underlying asset. A total return swap may\nterminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit\nevent with respect to the reference entity, subject to the\nprovisions of the related total return swap agreement between\nthe protection seller and the protection buyer. A credit option\nis a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge\nchanges in the credit quality of a reference entity. For\nexample, in a credit spread option, the option writer assumes\nthe obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the\nreference entity at a specified \u201cstrike\u201d spread level. The\noption purchaser buys the right to sell credit default\nprotection on the reference entity to, or purchase it from, the\noption writer at the strike spread level. The payments on credit\nspread options depend either on a particular credit spread or\nthe price of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or other\nreference entity. The options usually terminate if a credit\nevent occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity. A\ncredit-linked note is a form of credit derivative structured as\na debt security with an embedded credit default swap. The\npurchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to\nthe issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be\nnegatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference\nentity. If the reference entity defaults, the note may be cash\nsettled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of\nthe reference entity. Thus, the maximum amount of the note\npurchaser\u2019s exposure is the amount paid for the credit-linked\nnote.\n                              263                               \nThe following tables

sold.\n(2) The fair value amount payable is composed of $ 6,097million\nunder protection purchased and $ 1,985million under protection\nsold.\nFair values included in the above tables are prior to\napplication of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For\nnotional amounts, there is generally a difference between the\ntotal notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and\nCiti may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering\ninto offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired.\nThe open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are\nlargely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets\nare considered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either\nto a duration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of\nsubordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit\nderivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to\nevaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned\ninternal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be \u201cBaa/BBB\u201d and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. Citigroup\nevaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives\nfor which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit\nrating assigned to the underlying reference credit. Credit\nderivatives written on an underlying non-investment-grade\nreference entity represent greater payment risk to the Company.\nThe non-investment-grade category in the table above also\nincludes credit derivatives where the underlying reference\nentity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the\nderivative.\n                              264                               \nThe maximum potential amount\nof future payments under\ncredit derivative contracts\npresented in the table above\nis based on the notional value\nof the derivatives. The\nCompany believes that the\nnotional amount for credit\nprotection sold is not\nrepresentative of the actual\nloss exposure based on\nhistorical experience. This\namount has not been reduced by\nthe value of the reference\nassets and the related cash\nflows. In accordance with most\ncredit derivative contracts,\nshould a credit event occur,\nthe Company usually is liable\nfor the difference between the\nprotection sold and the value\nof the reference assets.\nFurthermore, the notional\namount for credit protection\nsold has not been reduced for\nany cash collateral paid to a\ngiven counterparty, as such\npayments would be calculated\nafter netting all derivative\nexposures, including any\ncredit derivatives with that\ncounterparty in accordance\nwith a related master netting\nagreement. Due to such netting\nprocesses, determining the\namount of collateral that\ncorresponds to credit\nderivative exposures alone is\nnot possible. The Company\nactively monitors open credit-\nrisk exposures and manages\nthis exposure by using a\nvariety of strategies,\nincluding purchased credit\nderivatives, cash collateral\nor direct holdings of the\nreferenced assets. This risk\nmitigation activity is not\ncaptured in the table above.\nCredit Risk-Related Contingent\nFeatures in Derivatives\nCertain derivative instruments\ncontain provisions that\nrequire the Company to either\npost additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at December\n31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n15billion and $ 15billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 13billion and $\n12billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. A downgrade\ncould trigger additional\ncollateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company\nand certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and\nCitibank were downgraded a\nsingle notch by all threemajor\nrating agencies as of December\n31, 2024, the Company could be\nrequired to post an additional\n$ 0.2billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in an amount of\nless than $ 1million upon the\nsingle notch downgrade,\nresulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$ 0.2billion .\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers The\nCompany executes total return\nswaps that provide it with\nsynthetic exposure to\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic return of the\nsecurities or other financial\nassets referenced in the\ncontract. In certain cases,\nthe derivative transaction is\naccompanied by the Company\u2019s\ntransfer of the referenced\nfinancial asset to the\nderivative counterparty, most\ntypically in response to the\nderivative counterparty\u2019s\ndesire to hedge, in whole or\nin part, its synthetic\nexposure under the derivative\ncontract by holding the\nreferenced asset in funded\nform. In certain jurisdictions\nthese transactions qualify as\nsales, resulting in\nderecognition of the\nsecurities transferred (see\nNote 1 for further discussion\nof the related sale conditions\nfor transfers of financial\nassets). For a significant\nportion of the transactions,\nthe Company has also executed\nanother total return swap\nwhere the Company passes on\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic return of the\nreferenced securities to a\ndifferent third party seeking\nthe exposure. In those cases,\nthe Company is not exposed, on\na net basis, to changes in the\neconomic return of the\nreferenced securities. These\ntransactions generally involve\nthe transfer of the Company\u2019s\nliquid government bonds,\nconvertible bonds or publicly\ntraded corporate equity\nsecurities from the trading\nportfolio and are executed\nwith third-party financial\ninstitutions. The accompanying\nderivatives are typically\ntotal return swaps. The\nderivatives are cash settled\nand subject to ongoing margin\nrequirements. When the\nconditions for sale accounting\nare met, the Company reports\nthe transfer of the referenced\nfinancial asset as a sale and\nseparately reports the\naccompanying derivative\ntransaction. These\ntransactions generally do not\nresult in a gain or loss on\nthe sale of the security,\nbecause the transferred\nsecurity was held at fair\nvalue in the Company\u2019s trading\nportfolio. For transfers of\nfinancial assets accounted for\nas a sale by the Company, and\nfor which the Company has\nretained substantially all of\nthe economic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n6.2billion and $ 4.3billion as\nof December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. At December 31,\n2024, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 5.8billion . The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of December 31, 2024\nwas $ 179million recorded as\ngross derivative assets and $\n29million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n4.3billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 121million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n29million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              265                               \n                                                                \n  25. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK                             \n                                                                \nConcentrations of credit risk\nexist when changes in\neconomic, industry or\ngeographic factors similarly\naffect groups of\ncounterparties whose aggregate\ncredit exposure is material in\nrelation to Citigroup\u2019s total\ncredit exposure. Although\nCitigroup\u2019s portfolio of\nfinancial instruments is\nbroadly diversified along\nindustry, product and\ngeographic lines, material\ntransactions are completed\nwith other financial\ninstitutions, particularly in\nthe securities trading,\nderivatives and foreign\nexchange businesses. In\nconnection with the Company\u2019s\nefforts to maintain a\ndiversified portfolio, the\nCompany limits its exposure to\nany one geographic region,\ncountry or individual creditor\nand monitors this exposure on\na continuous basis. At\nDecember 31, 2024, Citigroup\u2019s\nmost significant concentration\nof credit risk was in AFS and\nHTM securities and Trading-\nrelated assets (trading\nsecurities) (collectively\nreferred to below as\n\u201csecurities exposure\u201d) with\nthe U.S. government and its\nagencies, foreign governments,\nand states and municipalities.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nthe Company\u2019s securities\nexposure to the U.S.\ngovernment and its agencies\nwas $ 493billion and $\n517billion; to foreign\ngovernments was $ 209billion\nand $ 206billion; and to\nstates and municipalities was\n$ 11billion and $ 12billion,\nrespectively.\n                              266                               \n                                                                \n              This page intentionally left blank.               \n                                                                \n                              267                               \n                                                                \n  26. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT                                    \n                                                                \nASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement , defines fair value,\nestablishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and\nrequires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value\nis defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date, and\ntherefore represents an exit price. Among other things, the\nstandard requires the Company to maximize the use of observable\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value. Under ASC 820-10, the probability of\ncounterparty default is factored into the valuation of\nderivatives and other positions, and the impact of Citigroup\u2019s\nown credit risk is factored into the valuation of derivatives\nand other liabilities that are measured at fair value. Fair\nValue Hierarchy Principles ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of\ninputs based on whether the inputs are observable or\nunobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data\nand reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable\ninputs reflect the Company\u2019s market assumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022\nLevel 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active\nmarkets. \u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in\nactive markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active and model-derived\nvaluations in which all significant inputs and value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable . As required under\nthe fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and\nobservable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The\nfair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes\nrules-based and data-driven criteria to determine whether an\ninstrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022 The\ndetermination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active\nmarket and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is based on\nthe frequency of observed transactions and the quality of\nindependent market data available on the measurement date. \u2022 A\nLevel 2 classification is assigned where there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to models, or where any unobservable\ninputs are not significant to the valuation. The determination\nof whether an input is considered observable is based on the\navailability of independent market data and its corroboration,\nfor example through observed transactions in the market. \u2022\nOtherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.\n\nDetermination of Fair Value and Hierarchy Levels For assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value, the Company measures fair\nvalue using the procedures set out below, irrespective of\nwhether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as\na result of an election, a non-recurring lower-of-cost-or-market\n(LOCOM) adjustment, or because they are required to be measured\nat fair value. When available, the Company uses quoted market\nprices from active markets to determine fair value and\nclassifies such items as Level 1. In some specific cases where a\nmarket price is available, the Company will apply practical\nexpedients (such as matrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in\nwhich case the items may be classified as Level 2. The Company\nmay also apply a price-based methodology that utilizes, where\navailable, quoted prices or other market information obtained\nfrom recent trading activity in positions with the same or\nsimilar characteristics to the position being valued. If\nrelevant and observable prices are available, those valuations\nmay be classified as Level 2. However, when there are one or\nmore significant unobservable \u201cprice\u201d inputs, those valuations\nwill be classified as Level 3. Furthermore, when a quoted price\nis considered stale, a significant adjustment to the price of a\nsimilar security is necessary to reflect differences in the\nterms of the actual security being valued, or alternatively,\nwhen prices from independent sources are insufficient to\ncorroborate a valuation, the \u201cprice\u201d inputs are considered\nunobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as\nLevel 3. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value\nis based upon internally developed valuation techniques that\nuse, where possible, current market-based parameters, such as\ninterest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Items\nvalued using such internally generated valuation techniques are\nclassified according to the lowest level input or value driver\nthat is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be\nclassified as Level 3 even though there may be some significant\ninputs that are readily observable. Where internal valuation\ntechniques are used to determine fair value estimates,\nindependent vendor or broker data is utilized when possible.\nVendor and broker valuations may be based on a variety of inputs\nranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models,\nand the Company assesses the quality and relevance of this\ninformation in determining the estimate of fair value. The\nfollowing section describes the valuation methodologies used by\nthe Company to measure various financial instruments at fair\nvalue. Where appropriate, the description includes details of\nthe valuation models, the key inputs to those models and any\nsignificant assumptions. Market Valuation Adjustments Generally,\nthe unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual\nfinancial instrument. The Company applies market valuation\nadjustments that are consistent with the unit of account, which\ndo not include adjustments due to the size of the Company\u2019s\nposition, except as follows. ASC 820-10 permits an exception,\nthrough an accounting policy election, to measure the fair value\nof a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on\nthe basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria\nare met. Citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of\nfinancial instruments that meet those\n                              268                               \ncriteria, such as derivatives,\non the basis of the net open\nrisk position. Valuation\nadjustments are applied to\nitems classified as Level 2 or\nLevel 3 in the fair value\nhierarchy to ensure that the\nfair value reflects the price\nat which the net open risk\nposition could be exited.\nThese valuation adjustments\nare based on the bid/offer\nspread for an instrument in\nthe market. When Citi has\nelected to measure certain\nportfolios of financial\ninvestments, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open risk position,\nthe valuation adjustment may\ntake into account the size of\nthe position. Credit valuation\nadjustments (CVA) and funding\nvaluation adjustments (FVA)\nare applied to certain over-\nthe-counter (OTC) derivative\ninstruments where adjustments\nto reflect counterparty credit\nrisk, own credit risk and term\nfunding risk are required to\nestimate fair value. This\nprincipally includes\nderivatives with a base\nvaluation (e.g., discounted\nusing overnight indexed swap\n(OIS)) requiring adjustment\nfor these effects, such as\nuncollateralized interest rate\nswaps. The CVA represents a\nportfolio-level adjustment to\nreflect the risk premium\nassociated with the\ncounterparty\u2019s (assets) or\nCiti\u2019s (liabilities) non-\nperformance risk. The FVA\nrepresents a market funding\nrisk premium inherent in the\nuncollateralized portion of a\nderivative portfolio and in\ncertain collateralized\nderivative portfolios that do\nnot include standard credit\nsupport annexes (CSAs), such\nas where the CSA does not\npermit the reuse of collateral\nreceived. Citi\u2019s FVA\nmethodology leverages the\nexisting CVA methodology to\nestimate a funding exposure\nprofile. The calculation of\nthis exposure profile\nconsiders collateral\nagreements in which the terms\ndo not permit the Company to\nreuse the collateral received,\nincluding where counterparties\npost collateral to third-party\ncustodians. Citi\u2019s CVA and FVA\nmethodologies consist of two\nsteps: \u2022 First, the exposure\nprofile for each counterparty\nis determined using the terms\nof all individual derivative\npositions, and a Monte Carlo\nsimulation or other\nquantitative analysis is used\nto generate a series of\nexpected cash flows at future\npoints in time. The\ncalculation of this exposure\nprofile considers the effect\nof credit risk mitigants and\nsources of funding, including\npledged cash or other\ncollateral and any legal right\nof offset that exists with a\ncounterparty through\narrangements such as netting\nagreements. Individual\nderivative contracts that are\nsubject to an enforceable\nmaster netting agreement with\na counterparty are aggregated\nas a netting set for this\npurpose, since it is those net\ncash flows that are subject to\nnonperformance risk. This\nprocess identifies specific,\npoint-in-time future cash\nflows that are subject to\nnonperformance and term\nfunding risk, rather than\nusing the current recognized\nnet asset or liability as a\nbasis to measure the CVA and\nFVA. \u2022 Second, for CVA,\nmarket-based views of default\nprobabilities derived from\nobserved credit spreads in the\ncredit default swap (CDS)\nmarket are applied to the\nexpected future cash flows\ndetermined in step one. Citi\u2019s\nown credit CVA is determined\nusing Citi-specific CDS\nspreads for the relevant\ntenor. Generally, counterparty\nCVA is determined using CDS\nspread indices for each\n\ncredit rating and tenor. For\ncertain identified netting\nsets where individual analysis\nis practicable (e.g.,\nexposures to counterparties\nwith liquid CDSs),\ncounterparty-specific CDS\nspreads are used. For FVA, a\nterm structure of spreads is\napplied to the expected\nfunding exposures (e.g., the\nmarket liquidity spread used\nto represent the term funding\npremium associated with\ncertain OTC derivatives). The\nCVA and FVA are designed to\nincorporate a market view of\nthe credit and funding risk,\nrespectively, inherent in the\nderivative portfolio. However,\nmost unsecured derivative\ninstruments are negotiated\nbilateral contracts and are\nnot commonly transferred to\nthird parties. Derivative\ninstruments are normally\nsettled contractually or, if\nterminated early, are\nterminated at a value\nnegotiated bilaterally between\nthe parties. Thus, the CVA and\nFVA may not be realized upon a\nsettlement or termination in\nthe normal course of business.\nIn addition, all or a portion\nof these adjustments may be\nreversed or otherwise adjusted\nin future periods in the event\nof changes in the credit or\nfunding risk associated with\nthe derivative instruments.\nThe table below summarizes the\nCVA and FVA applied to the\nfair value of derivative\ninstruments (recorded in\nTrading account assets and\nTrading account liabilities on\nthe Consolidated Balance\nSheet) at December 31, 2024\nand 2023:\n                                                                \n                         Credit and funding                     \n                                  valuation                     \n                                adjustments                     \n                           contra-liability                     \n                             (contra-asset)                     \n  In millions of               December 31,       December 31,  \n  dollars                              2024               2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Counterparty CVA    $                -561    $          -580  \n  Asset FVA                            -539               -562  \n  Citigroup (own                        346                381  \n  credit) CVA                                                   \n  Liability FVA                         209                255  \n  Total CVA and                                                 \n  FVA\u2014derivative      $                -545    $          -506  \n  instruments                                                   \n                                                                \n                              269                               \nThe table below summarizes\npretax gains (losses) related\nto changes in CVA and FVA on\nderivative instruments, net of\nhedges (recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome), and changes in debt\nvaluation adjustments (DVA) on\nCiti\u2019s own fair value option\n(FVO) liabilities (recorded in\nOther comprehensive income in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nComprehensive Income) for the\nyears indicated:\n                                                                \n                       Credit/fundin\u2026                           \n                            valuation                           \n                          adjustments                           \n  In millions of          gain (loss)                           \n  dollars                        2024         2023        2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Counterparty      $             -63    $     -31    $   -227  \n  CVA                                                           \n  Asset FVA                        68           64        -102  \n  Own credit CVA                  -56         -212         157  \n  Liability FVA                   -46          -23         155  \n  Total CVA and                                                 \n  FVA\u2014derivative    $             -97    $    -202    $    -17  \n  instruments                                                   \n  DVA related to                                                \n  own FVO           $            -573    $  -2,078    $  2,685  \n  liabilities(1)                                                \n  Total CVA, DVA    $            -670    $  -2,280    $  2,668  \n  and FVA                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 21.\nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities\nSold Under Agreements to Repurchase As no quoted prices exist\nfor these instruments, fair value is determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow technique. Cash flows are estimated based\non the terms of the contract, taking into account any embedded\nderivatives or other features. These cash flows are discounted\nusing interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the\ninstrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral.\nGenerally, when such instruments are recorded at fair value,\nthey are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy,\nas the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable.\nHowever, certain long-dated positions are classified within\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Trading Account Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Trading Securities and Trading Loans When available,\nthe Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to\ndetermine the fair value of trading securities; such items are\nclassified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples\ninclude government securities and exchange-traded equity\nsecurities. For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the\ncounter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing\nvarious valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows,\nprice-based and internal models. Where internal valuation\ntechniques are used to determine fair value estimates, prices\nfrom independent sources, including third-party vendors, are\nutilized when possible. A price-based methodology utilizes,\nwhere available, quoted prices or other market information\nobtained from recent trading activity of instruments with\nsimilar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued. The\nyields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the\nsame price information. Trading securities and loans priced\nusing such methods are generally classified as Level 2.\n\nHowever, when the significant inputs to the valuation are\nunobservable, or prices from independent sources are\ninsufficient to corroborate valuation, a loan or security is\ngenerally classified as Level 3. Where internal valuation\ntechniques are used to determine fair value estimates, prices\nfrom independent sources, including third-party vendors, are\nutilized when possible. When the Company\u2019s principal exit market\nfor a portfolio of loans is through securitization, the Company\nuses the securitization price as a key input into the fair value\nof the loan portfolio. The securitization price is determined\nfrom the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization\nwithin the current market environment. Where such a valuation\napproach is possible, loan portfolios are typically classified\nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For most of the\nsubprime mortgage-backed security (MBS) exposures, fair value is\ndetermined utilizing observable transactions where available, or\nother valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis\nutilizing valuation assumptions derived from similar, more\nobservable securities as market proxies. The valuation of\ncertain asset-backed security (ABS) collateralized debt\nobligation (CDO) positions is inferred through the net asset\nvalue of the underlying assets of the ABS CDO. Trading Account\nAssets and Liabilities\u2014Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives,\nmeasured at fair value using quoted (i.e., exchange) prices in\nactive markets, where available, are classified as Level 1\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. Derivatives without a quoted\nprice in an active market and derivatives executed over the\ncounter are valued using internal valuation techniques. These\nderivative instruments are classified as either Level 2 or Level\n3 depending on the observability of the significant inputs to\nthe valuation. The valuation techniques depend on the type of\nderivative and the nature of the underlying instrument. The\nprincipal techniques used to value these instruments are\ndiscounted cash flows and internal models, such as derivative\npricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo\nsimulations). The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative\nand the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest\nrate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities and\ncorrelation. Investments The investments category includes\navailable-for-sale debt and marketable equity securities whose\nfair values are generally determined by utilizing similar\nprocedures described for trading securities above or, in some\ncases, using vendor pricing as the primary source. Also included\nin investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and\nreal estate entities. Determining the fair value of nonpublic\nsecurities involves a significant degree of management judgment,\nas no quoted prices exist and such securities are not generally\ntraded. In addition, there may be transfer restrictions on\nprivate equity securities. The Company\u2019s process for determining\nthe fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted\nvaluation techniques, including guideline public company\nanalysis and comparable\n                              270                               \ntransactions. In determining\nthe fair value of nonpublic\nsecurities, the Company also\nconsiders events such as a\nproposed sale of the investee\ncompany, initial public\nofferings, equity issuances or\nother observable transactions.\nPrivate equity securities are\ngenerally classified within\nLevel 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy. Mortgage Servicing\nRights The fair value of the\nmortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs), included in Intangible\nassets , is primarily affected\nby changes in prepayments of\nmortgages that result from\nshifts in mortgage interest\nrates. Specifically, higher\ninterest rates tend to lead to\ndeclining prepayments, which\ncauses the fair value of the\nMSRs to increase. In managing\nthis risk, Citigroup\neconomically hedges a\nsignificant portion of the\nvalue of its MSRs through the\nuse of interest rate\nderivative contracts, forward\npurchase and sale commitments\nof mortgage-backed securities\nand purchased securities, all\nclassified as Trading account\nassets . See Note 23 for\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s MSRs. Short-Term\nBorrowings and Long-Term Debt\nWhere fair value accounting\nhas been elected, the fair\nvalue of non-structured\nliabilities is determined by\nutilizing internal models\nusing the appropriate discount\nrate for the applicable\nmaturity. Such instruments are\nclassified within Level 2 of\nthe fair value hierarchy when\nall significant inputs are\nreadily observable. The\nCompany determines the fair\nvalue of hybrid financial\ninstruments, including\nstructured liabilities, using\nthe appropriate derivative\nvaluation methodology\n(described above in \u201cTrading\nAccount Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Derivatives\u201d)\ngiven the nature of the\nembedded risk profile. Such\ninstruments are classified\nwithin Level 2 or Level 3\ndepending on the observability\nof significant inputs to the\nvaluation.\n                              271                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company\nmay hedge positions that have been classified in the Level 3\ncategory with other financial instruments (hedging instruments)\nthat may be classified as Level 3, but also with financial\ninstruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2. The effects of\nthese hedges are presented gross in the following tables:\n\nFair Value Levels\n                                                                \n  In

the\nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The gains and losses\npresented below include changes in the fair value related to\nboth observable and unobservable inputs. The Company often\nhedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified\nin a different level. For example, the gains and losses for\nassets and liabilities in the Level 3 category presented in the\ntables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and\ngains on hedging instruments that may be classified in the Level\n1 and Level 2 categories. In addition, the Company hedges items\nclassified in the Level 3 category with instruments also\nclassified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Level 3\nto Level 2 transfers were primarily the result of enhanced\nsignificance testing of unobservable inputs for certain\nstructured debt instruments. The Level 2 to Level 3 transfers\nwere primarily the result of certain unobservable inputs\nbecoming more significant to the overall valuation of these\ninstruments. The Level 3 to Level 2 transfers of $ 1.0billion\nrelated to Equity contracts were primarily the result of certain\nunobservable inputs related to equity options becoming less\nsignificant to the overall valuation of these instruments. The\nfollowing were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period\nDecember 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023: During the 12 months\nended December 31, 2023, transfers of Long-term debt were $\n4.9billion from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $ 4.9billion\ntransfer, approximately $ 4.2billion related to interest rate\noption volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or\nsignificant relative to their overall valuation, and $\n0.6billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in\naddition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate\nvolatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to\ntheir overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have\nresulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some\nunobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall\nvaluation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-\nin or deep-out of the money) . This has primarily resulted in $\n10.2billion of certain structured long-term debt products being\ntransferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the 12 months ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n                              279                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements The Company\u2019s Level 3 inventory consists of both\ncash instruments and derivatives of varying complexity. The\nfollowing tables present the valuation techniques covering the\nmajority of Level 3 inventory and the most significant\nunobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements.\nMethodologies are applied consistently.\n\nChanges in listed inputs period versus period represent\nvariables that become more, or less, significant, hence their\naddition or removal from the tables below. Differences between\nthese tables and amounts presented in the Level 3 Fair Value\nRollforward tables represent individually immaterial items that\nhave been measured using a variety of valuation

there is insufficient\nor dispersed market data to allow a precise determination of the\nexit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today\u2019s\nmarket. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value\ninstruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that\nmay be both unobservable and significant to the instrument\u2019s (or\nportfolio\u2019s) overall fair value measurement. The uncertainties\nassociated with key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements may not be independent of one another. In\naddition, the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair\nvalue measurement for a given change in an unobservable input\ndepends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the\nCompany holds the instrument as an asset or a liability. For\ncertain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk management\nare sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather\nthan on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs.\nThe following section describes some of the most significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements. Correlation Correlation is a measure of the extent\nto which two or more variables change in relation to each other.\nA variety of correlation-related assumptions are required for a\nwide range of instruments, including equity and credit baskets,\nforeign exchange options, Credit Index Tranches and many other\ninstruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations\nare not directly observable in the market and must be calculated\nusing alternative sources, including historical information.\nEstimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may\nvary over time, and calculating correlation information from\nmarket data requires significant assumptions regarding the\ninformational efficiency of the market (e.g., swaption markets).\nUncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate\nlevel of correlation as an input into some fair value\nmeasurements is required. Changes in correlation levels can have\na substantial impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of\nan instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default\ncorrelation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising\na CDO structure would affect the fair value of the senior\ntranche. For example, an increase in the default correlation of\nthe underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior\ntranche, because highly correlated instruments produce greater\nlosses in the event of default and a portion of these losses\nwould become attributable to the senior tranche. That same\nchange in default correlation would have a different impact on\njunior tranches of the same structure. Volatility Volatility\nrepresents the speed and severity of market price changes and is\na key factor in pricing options. Volatility generally depends on\nthe tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or\nlevel defined in the contract. Volatilities for certain\ncombinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to\nbe estimated using alternative methods, such as comparable\ninstruments, historical analysis or other sources of market\ninformation. This leads to uncertainty around the final fair\nvalue measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities.\nThe general relationship between changes in the value of an\ninstrument (or a portfolio) to changes in volatility also\ndepends on changes in interest rates and the level of the\nunderlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets)\nbenefit from increases in volatility, whereas short option\npositions (liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are\nmore sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For\nexample, an at-the-money option would experience a greater\npercentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money\noption. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than\none underlying security (e.g., an option on a basket of\nequities) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying\nsecurities as well as their correlations. Yield In some\ncircumstances, the yield of an instrument is not observable in\nthe market and must be estimated from historical data or from\nyields of similar securities. This estimated yield may need to\nbe adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being\nvalued. Whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to\nthe value of the security, the fair value measurement is\nclassified as Level 3. Adjusted yield is generally used to\ndiscount the projected future principal and interest cash flows\non instruments, such as asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield\nis impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and\nrelevant credit spreads. Prepayment Voluntary unscheduled\npayments (prepayments) change the future cash flows for the\ninvestor and thereby change the fair value of the security. The\neffect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential\nmortgage-backed securities. Prepayment is generally negatively\ncorrelated with delinquency and interest rate. A combination of\nlow prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input\u2019s\nnegative impact on a mortgage security\u2019s valuation. As\nprepayment speeds change, the weighted-average life of the\nsecurity changes, which impacts the valuation either positively\nor negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and the\ndirection of the change in the weighted-average life. Recovery\nRecovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a\nbond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation\nscenario. For many credit securities (e.g., commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities), the expected recovery amount of a defaulted\nproperty is typically unknown until a liquidation of the\nproperty is imminent. The assumed recovery of a security may\ndiffer from its actual recovery that will be observable in the\nfuture. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate assumption\nincreases the fair value of the security. An increase in loss\nseverity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the amount\nof principal available for distribution and, as a result,\ndecreases the fair value of the security.\n                              283                               \nCredit Spread Credit spread is\na component of the security\nrepresenting its credit\nquality. Credit spread\nreflects the market perception\nof changes in prepayment,\ndelinquency and recovery\nrates, therefore capturing the\nimpact of other variables on\nthe fair value. Changes in\ncredit spread affect the fair\nvalue of securities\ndifferently depending on the\ncharacteristics and maturity\nprofile of the security. For\nexample, credit spread is a\nmore significant driver of the\nfair value measurement of a\nhigh-yield bond as compared to\nan investment-grade bond.\nGenerally, the credit spread\nfor an investment-grade bond\nis also more observable and\nless volatile than its high-\nyield counterpart.\n\nItems Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nCertain assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and,\ntherefore, are not included in\nthe tables above.

If no such quoted price exists,\nthe fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a\nsimilar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of\nthat loan. Fair value for the other real estate owned is based\non appraisals. For loans whose carrying amount is based on the\nfair value of the underlying collateral, the fair values depend\non the type of collateral. Fair value of the collateral is\ntypically estimated based on quoted market prices if available,\nappraisals or other internal valuation techniques. Where the\nfair value of the related collateral is based on an appraised\nvalue, the loan is generally classified as Level 3. In addition,\nfor corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are often\nbased on sales of similar assets; however, because the prices of\nsimilar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the\nunique features of the underlying collateral, these fair value\nmeasurements are generally classified as Level 3. The fair value\nof non-marketable equity securities under the measurement\nalternative is based on observed transaction prices for the\nidentical or similar investment of the same issuer, or an\ninternal valuation technique in the case of an impairment. Where\nthere are insufficient market observations to conclude the\ninputs are observable, where significant adjustments are made to\nthe observed transaction prices or when an internal valuation\ntechnique is used, the security is classified as Level 3. Fair\nvalue may differ from the observed transaction price due to a\nnumber of factors, including marketability adjustments and\ndifferences in rights and obligations when the observed\ntransaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.\n                              284                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Nonrecurring Fair\nValue Measurements\nThe

instruments that are not\ncarried at fair value. The tables below therefore exclude items\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the\ntables above. The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate\ninvestments, pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance\ncontracts and tax-related items. Also, as required, the\ndisclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount\nthat could result from offering for sale at one time the entire\nholdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value\nassociated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other\nexpenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In\naddition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets\nand liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise,\nrelationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full\nassessment of Citigroup\u2019s financial position and the value of\nits net assets. Fair values vary from period to period based on\nchanges in a wide range of factors, including interest rates,\ncredit quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing\nassets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered\ninto.\n                                                                \n            Dec\u2026                   Est\u2026                         \n

See Notes 21 and 26.\n                              287                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 21\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss\nof $ 573million and a loss of $ 2,078million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in fair value\nresulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were\nestimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads\nobservable in the bond market into the relevant valuation\ntechnique used to value each liability as described above. The\nFair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nSelected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to\nResell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the U.S., the U.K. and\nJapan. In each case, the election was made because the related\ninterest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily\nwith offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at\nfair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for\ntransactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal\ntransactions . The related interest income and interest expense\nare measured based on the contractual rates specified in the\ntransactions and are reported as Interest income and Interest\nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Loans and Other\nCredit Products Citigroup has also elected the fair value option\nfor certain other originated and purchased loans, including\ncertain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters\nof credit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading\nbusinesses. Significant groups of transactions include loans and\nunfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or\nsecuritized in the near term, or transactions where the economic\nrisks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased\ncredit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company\npays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party.\nCitigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate\naccounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex\nand to achieve operational simplifications.

Related interest income is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nincome on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk were a loss of $\n38million and a gain of $ 39million, respectively. Changes in\nfair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated\nbased on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and\nrecovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of\nits commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment\nis bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract and reports the contract within\nTrading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across\nunallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $\n0.9billion and $ 0.6billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi\ntrades unallocated precious metals investments and executes\nforward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with\ntrading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious\nmetals investment, Citi\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is\nrepaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated\nprecious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the\ntrading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is\naccounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.\nCertain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS) Citigroup has elected\nthe fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime\nfixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans\nHFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are\neconomically hedged with derivative instruments.

The Company\nhas elected the fair value option where the interest rate risk\nof such liabilities may be economically hedged with derivative\ncontracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets\nthat will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings.\nThe elections have been made to mitigate accounting mismatches\nand to achieve operational simplifications. These positions are\nreported in Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The portion of the changes\nin fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (i.e., DVA) is reflected as a component of AOCI while\nall other changes in fair value are reported in Principal\ntransactions . Interest expense on non-structured liabilities is\nmeasured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as\nInterest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nThe following table provides information about long-term debt\nand short-term borrowings carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of           December 31,           December 31,  \n  dollars                          2024                   2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Long-term debt                                                \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the    $          112,719    $           116,338  \n  Consolidated                                                  \n  Balance Sheet                                                 \n  Aggregate                                                     \n  unpaid                                                        \n  principal                                                     \n  balance in                     -1,943                 -2,842  \n  excess of (less                                               \n  than) fair                                                    \n  value                                                         \n  Short-term                                                    \n  borrowings                                                    \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the    $           12,484    $             6,545  \n  Consolidated                                                  \n  Balance Sheet                                                 \n  Aggregate                                                     \n  unpaid                                                        \n  principal                                                     \n  balance in                        -87                    -60  \n  excess of (less                                               \n  than) fair                                                    \n  value                                                         \n                                                                \n                              290                               \n28.

This\ncollateral was received in connection with resale agreements,\nsecurities borrowings and loans, securities for securities\nlending transactions, derivative transactions and margined\nbroker loans.

For certain contracts meeting the definition of a\nguarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a\nliability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in\nissuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose\nthe maximum potential amount of future payments that the\nguarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts\nbear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\nThe following tables present information about Citi\u2019s\nguarantees:\n

liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n(2) At December 31, 2024 and 2023, this maximum potential\nexposure was estimated to be approximately $ 124.3billion and $\n138billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants. As such, any losses\nincurred and the carrying amounts of Citi\u2019s contingent\nobligations related to merchant processing activities were\nimmaterial. See \u201cCard Merchant Processing\u201d below.\n(3) Includes additional guarantees entered into as part of the\nextension and amendment of the American Airlines co-branded\ncredit card partnership agreement, executed in December 2024.\nSee \u201cCredit Card Arrangements with Partners\u201d below. Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of\nactual potential loss exposure based on historical and expected\nfuture performance of the portfolio.\n(4) Includes guarantees of subsidiaries.\n                              292                               \nFinancial Standby Letters of Credit Citi issues standby letters\nof credit, which substitute its own credit for that of the\nborrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is\nobligated to repay Citi. Standby letters of credit protect a\nthird party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial\nstandby letters of credit include (i) guarantees of payment of\ninsurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial\nrevenue bond underwriting, (ii) settlement of payment\nobligations to clearing houses, including futures and over-the-\ncounter derivatives clearing (see further discussion below),\n(iii) support options and purchases of securities in lieu of\nescrow deposit accounts and (iv) letters of credit that backstop\nloans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade\nacceptances. Performance Guarantees Performance guarantees and\nletters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer\u2019s tender\nbid on a construction or systems-installation project or to\nguarantee completion of such projects in accordance with\ncontract terms. They are also issued to support a customer\u2019s\nobligation to supply specified products, commodities or\nmaintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative\nInstruments Considered to Be Guarantees Derivatives are\nfinancial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional\namount and an underlying instrument, reference credit or index,\nwhere there is little or no initial investment and whose terms\nrequire or permit net settlement. See Note 24 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities. Derivative instruments\nconsidered to be guarantees include only those instruments that\nrequire Citi to make payments to the counterparty based on\nchanges in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset,\na liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party.\nMore specifically, derivative instruments considered to be\nguarantees include certain over-the-counter written put options\nwhere the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-\ndealer (such counterparties are considered to be dealers in\nthese markets and may, therefore, not hold the underlying\ninstruments). Credit derivatives sold by Citi are excluded from\nthe tables above as they are disclosed separately in Note 24. In\ninstances where Citi\u2019s maximum potential future payment is\nunlimited, the notional amount of the contract is disclosed.\nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts\npresented in the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase\nreserve for its potential repurchases or make-whole liability\nregarding residential mortgage representation and warranty\nclaims related to its whole loan sales to U.S. government-\nsponsored agencies and, to a lesser extent, private investors.\nThe repurchase reserve was approximately $ 12million and $\n11million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and these\namounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Securities Lending Indemnifications Owners of\nsecurities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other\nparties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party\nto satisfy some other obligation. Banks may administer such\nsecurities lending programs for their clients. Securities\nlending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee\nthat a securities lending customer will be made whole in the\nevent that the security borrower does not return the security\nsubject to the lending agreement and collateral held is\ninsufficient to cover the market value of the security. Card\nMerchant Processing Card merchant processing guarantees\nrepresent the Company\u2019s indirect obligations in connection with\n(i) providing transaction processing services to various\nmerchants with respect to its private label cards and (ii)\npotential liability for bank card transaction processing\nservices. The nature of the liability in either case arises as a\nresult of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder\nthat is ultimately resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor. The\nmerchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder. In\ngeneral, if the card processing company is unable to collect\nthis amount from the merchant, the card processing company bears\nthe loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to the\ncardholder. With regard to (i) above, Citi has the primary\ncontingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private\nlabel merchants. The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows\nbetween Citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis, and\nCiti has the right to offset any payments with cash flows\notherwise due to the merchant. To further mitigate this risk,\nCiti may delay settlement, require a merchant to make an escrow\ndeposit, include event triggers to provide Citi with more\nfinancial and operational control in the event of the financial\ndeterioration of the merchant or require various credit\nenhancements (including letters of credit and bank guarantees).\nIn the unlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to\ndeliver products, services or a refund to its private label\ncardholders, Citi is contingently liable to credit or refund\ncardholders. With regard to (ii) above, Citi has a potential\nliability for bank card transactions where Citi provides the\ntransaction processing services as well as those where a third\nparty provides the services and Citi acts as a secondary\nguarantor, should that processor fail to perform. Citi\u2019s maximum\npotential contingent liability related to both bank card and\nprivate label merchant processing services is estimated to be\nthe total volume of card transactions that meet the requirements\nto be valid charge-back transactions at any given time. At\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, this maximum potential exposure was\nestimated to be $ 124.3billion and $ 138.0billion, respectively.\nHowever, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not\nrepresentative of the actual potential loss exposure based on\nits historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely\nto arise, as most products and services are delivered when\npurchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned\n                              293                               \nto merchants. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its\ncontingent liability related to merchant processing based on the\nfinancial strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and\nnature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss\nexperience. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the losses incurred\nand the carrying amounts of Citi\u2019s contingent obligations\nrelated to merchant processing activities were immaterial.\nCredit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of its\ncredit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nand a minimum revenue target to be achieved by the program\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination and revenue targets are not met, the guarantees\nserve to compensate the partner for certain payments that\notherwise would have been generated in connection with such\noriginations and revenues generated by the program. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide coverage for certain losses\nassociated with purchased products, and protection for certain\ntravel-related purchases. These guarantees are not included in\nthe table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees\nand Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the actual and\nestimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi\u2019s\nobligations related to these programs were immaterial.\nGuarantees of Subsidiaries The Company, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, may enter into agreements that contain\nindemnifications between legal entities within the consolidated\ngroup, whereupon payment may become due if certain external\nevents occur. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered\ninto an agreement that indemnifies certain subsidiaries of the\nCompany against certain matters related to the business operated\nby the Company through other subsidiaries, including certain\nexisting and future legal actions and other matters, such as tax\nmatters. Certain of such indemnification obligations have no\nstated expiration date and are not subject to specific\nlimitations on the maximum potential amount of future payments\nthat the Company could be required to make. The Company is not\nable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments\nto be made under this agreement because the triggering events\nare not predictable. Other Representation and Warranty\nIndemnifications In the normal course of business, Citi provides\nstandard representations and warranties to counterparties in\ncontracts in connection with numerous transactions and also\nprovides indemnifications, including indemnifications that\nprotect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that\nadditional taxes are owed, due either to a change in the tax law\nor an adverse interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to\nthese transactions provide Citi with comparable\nindemnifications. While such representations, warranties and\nindemnifications are essential components of many contractual\nrelationships, they do not represent the underlying business\npurpose for the transactions. The indemnification clauses are\noften standard contractual terms related to Citi\u2019s own\nperformance under the terms of a contract and are entered into\nin the normal course of business based on an assessment that the\nrisk of loss is remote. Often these clauses are intended to\nensure that terms of a contract are met at inception.\nNocompensation is received for these standard representations\nand warranties, and it is not possible to determine their fair\nvalue because they rarely, if ever, result in a payment. In many\ncases, there are nostated or notional amounts included in the\nindemnification clauses, and the contingencies potentially\ntriggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are\nnot expected to occur. As a result, these indemnifications are\nnot included in the tables above. Value-Transfer Networks\n(Including Exchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs) Citi is a\nmember of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer\nnetworks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement systems as\nwell as exchanges) around the world. As a condition of\nmembership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready\nto pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the\norganization due to another member\u2019s default on its obligations.\nCiti\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its membership\ninterests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s funds, or, in\ncertain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share. The maximum\nexposure is difficult to estimate as this would require an\nassessment of claims that have not yet occurred; however, Citi\nbelieves the risk of loss is remote given historical experience\nwith the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s participation in VTNs is not\nreported in the guarantees tables above, and there are no\namounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2024 or 2023 for potential obligations that could\narise from Citi\u2019s involvement with VTN associations. Long-Term\nCare Insurance Indemnification In 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity\n(Travelers), then a subsidiary of Citi, entered into a\nreinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and rewards of its\nlong-term care (LTC) business to GE Life (now Genworth Financial\nInc., or Genworth), then a subsidiary of the General Electric\nCompany (GE). As part of this transaction, the reinsurance\nobligations were provided by two regulated insurance\nsubsidiaries of GE Life, which funded twocollateral trusts with\nsecurities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are\nreferred to as the Genworth Trusts.\n                              294                               \nAs part of GE\u2019s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the\nrisks and rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance\nagreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth\nthrough GE\u2019s Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC)\nsubsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition,\nGE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC\nthat is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay\nits reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance\nagreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has\nreinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has\nreinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC\npolicies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations\nnow benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While\nneither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the\ncapital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse\nand Citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital\nmaintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will\ncontinue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance\nobligations to Genworth. In connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of\nTravelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an\nindemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder\nclaims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the\nTravelers LTC policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by\nsubsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail\ninsurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers\nLTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original\nreinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and\nGenworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole\nbeneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are\ndesigned to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal\nto the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the\nTravelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are\nevaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair\nvalue of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount\nequal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the\nliabilities change over time. If both (i) Genworth fails to\nperform under the original Travelers/GE Life reinsurance\nagreement for any reason, including its insolvency or the\nfailure of UFLIC to perform under its reinsurance contract or GE\nto perform under the capital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the\nassets of the two Genworth Trusts are insufficient or\nunavailable, then Citi, through its LTC reinsurance\nindemnification, must reimburse Brighthouse for any losses\nincurred in connection with the LTC policies. Since both events\nwould have to occur before Citi would become responsible for any\npayment to Brighthouse pursuant to its indemnification\nobligation, and the likelihood of such events occurring is\ncurrently not probable, there is noliability reflected on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\nrelated to this indemnification. However, if both events become\nreasonably possible (meaning more than remote but less than\nprobable), Citi will be required to estimate and disclose a\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss to the extent that\nsuch an estimate could be made. In addition, if both events\nbecome probable, Citi will be required to accrue for such\nliability in accordance with applicable accounting principles.\nFutures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides\nclearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients\nthat need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and\ncircumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for\naccounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these\nclient transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the\nunderlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. See Note 24 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities that are reflected in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. As a clearing member, Citi\ncollects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin)\nbetween its clients and the respective CCP. In certain\ncircumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or\nsecurities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs.\nThis excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as\nbanks or carry brokers. There are twotypes of margin: initial\nand variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash\ninitial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial\nmargin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or\ndepository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables\n(payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and\ndue from banks , respectively. However, for exchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain\nbenefits from or control the client cash balances, the client\ncash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the\nCCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi\nhas contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 14.9billion and $ 17.8billion as of December 31,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. Variation margin due from clients\nto the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts for\neach trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the\nrisk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to\npost variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the\nvalue of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of\nnon-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event\nthat the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n                              295                               \nFICC Sponsored Member Repo Program Citi acts as a sponsoring\nmember of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation (FICC) to clear eligible resale and\nrepurchase agreements on behalf of its clients that become\nsponsored members of the FICC. Citi, as sponsoring member, is\nrequired to provide a guarantee to the FICC with respect to the\nprompt payment and performance of its sponsored members. Because\nCiti obtains a security interest in the cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral that the clients place with the clearing\nhouse, Citi expects the risk of loss from this guarantee to be\nremote. See Note 12 for additional information on Citi\u2019s resale\nand repurchase agreements, including risk mitigation practices\nfor these transactions. Carrying Value\u2014Guarantees and\nIndemnifications At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total\ncarrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees\nand indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to\napproximately $ 1.0billion and $ 1.2billion, respectively. The\ncarrying value of financial and performance guarantees is\nincluded in Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the\ncarrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities\n. Collateral Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse\nlosses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications\namounted to $ 49.0billion and $ 52.5billion at December 31, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets\nheld as collateral amounted to $ 62.5billion and $ 67.7billion\nat December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities\nlending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in\nfavor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 3.1billion and $\n3.1billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other\nproperty may also be available to Citi to cover losses under\ncertain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of\nsuch property has not been determined. Performance Risk Citi\nevaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the\nassigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be Baa/BBB and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. On certain\nunderlying referenced assets or entities, ratings are not\navailable. Such referenced assets are included in the \u201cnot\nrated\u201d category. The maximum potential amount of the future\npayments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to\nbe the notional amount of these contracts, which is the par\namount of the assets guaranteed. Presented in the tables below\nare the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are\nclassified based on internal and external credit ratings. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts\nbear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

business HFS countries\nunder sales agreements are reflected in their original\ncategories until the respective sales are completed.\n(2) Other commitments and contingencies include commitments to\npurchase certain debt and equity securities.\nThe majority of unused\ncommitments are contingent\nupon customers maintaining\nspecific credit standards.\nCommercial commitments\ngenerally have floating\ninterest rates and fixed\nexpiration dates and may\nrequire payment of fees. Such\nfees (net of certain direct\ncosts) are deferred and, upon\nexercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the\nloan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the\ncommitment period. Commercial\nand Similar Letters of Credit\nA commercial letter of credit\nis an instrument by which\nCitigroup substitutes its\ncredit for that of a customer\nto enable the customer to\nfinance the purchase of goods\nor to incur other commitments.\nCitigroup issues a letter on\nbehalf of its client to a\nsupplier and agrees to pay the\nsupplier upon presentation of\ndocumentary evidence that the\nsupplier has performed in\naccordance with the terms of\nthe letter of credit. When a\nletter of credit is drawn, the\ncustomer is then required to\nreimburse Citigroup. One- to\nFour-Family Residential\nMortgages A one- to four-\nfamily residential mortgage\ncommitment is a written\nconfirmation from Citigroup to\na seller of a property that\nthe bank will advance the\nspecified sums enabling the\nbuyer to complete the\npurchase. Revolving Open-End\nLoans Secured by One- to Four-\nFamily Residential Properties\nRevolving open-end loans\nsecured by one- to four-family\nresidential properties are\nessentially home equity lines\nof credit. A home equity line\nof credit is a loan secured by\na primary residence or second\nhome to the extent of the\nexcess of fair market value\nover the debt outstanding for\nthe first mortgage. Commercial\nReal Estate, Construction and\nLand Development Commercial\nreal estate, construction and\nland development include\nunused portions of commitments\nto extend credit for the\npurpose of financing\ncommercial and multifamily\nresidential properties as well\nas land development projects.\n\nBoth secured-by-real-estate\nand unsecured commitments are\nincluded in this line, as well\nas undistributed loan\nproceeds, where there is an\nobligation to advance for\nconstruction progress\npayments. However, this line\nonly includes those extensions\nof credit that, once funded,\nwill be classified as Total\nloans, net on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Credit Card\nLines Citigroup provides\ncredit to customers by issuing\ncredit cards. The credit card\nlines are cancelable by\nproviding notice to the\ncardholder or without such\nnotice as permitted by local\nlaw. Commercial and Other\nConsumer Loan Commitments\nCommercial and other consumer\nloan commitments include\noverdraft and liquidity\nfacilities as well as\ncommercial commitments to make\nor purchase loans, purchase\nthird-party receivables,\nprovide note issuance or\nrevolving underwriting\nfacilities and invest in the\nform of equity. Other\nCommitments As a Federal\nReserve member bank, Citi is\nrequired to subscribe to half\nof a certain amount of shares\nissued by its Federal Reserve\nDistrict Bank. As of December\n31, 2024 and 2023, Citi holds\nshares with a carrying value\nof $ 4.5billion, with the\nremaining half subject to call\nby the Federal Reserve\nDistrict Bank Board. In the\nnormal course of business,\nCiti enters into reverse\nrepurchase and securities\nborrowing agreements, as well\nas repurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023,\nCiti had approximately $\n117.7billion and $\n120.9billion of unsettled\nreverse repurchase and\nsecurities borrowing\nagreements, and approximately\n$ 126.8billion and $\n96.4billion of unsettled\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements,\nrespectively. See Note 12 for\na further discussion of\nsecurities purchased under\nagreements to resell and\nsecurities borrowed, and\nsecurities sold under\nagreements to repurchase and\nsecurities loaned, including\nthe Company\u2019s policy for\noffsetting repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements.\nThese amounts are not included\nin the table above.\n                              297                               \n29. LEASES\n\nThe Company\u2019s operating\nleases, where Citi is a\nlessee, include real estate,\nsuch as office space and\nbranches, and various types of\nequipment. These leases may\ncontain renewal and extension\noptions and early termination\nfeatures; however, these\noptions do not impact the\nlease term unless the Company\nis reasonably certain that it\nwill exercise options. These\nleases have a weighted-average\nremaining lease term of\napproximately 6.5years as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 6years\nas of December 31, 2023.\n\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s leases, see\nNote 1.\nThe following table presents\ninformation on the right-of-\nuse (ROU) asset and lease\nliabilities included in\nPremises and equipment and\nOther liabilities ,\nrespectively:\n                                                                \n                               December 31,       December 31,  \n  In millions of dollars               2024               2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  ROU asset                 $         2,836    $         2,801  \n  Lease liability                     3,013              2,974  \n                                                                \nThe Company recognizes fixed\nlease costs on a straight-line\nbasis throughout the lease\nterm in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

It distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the\nfollowing three terms: \u201cprobable,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe future\nevent or events are likely to occur\u201d; \u201cremote,\u201d meaning that\n\u201cthe chance of the future event or events occurring is slight\u201d;\nand \u201creasonably possible,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe chance of the\nfuture event or events occurring is more than remote but less\nthan likely.\u201d These three terms are used below as defined in ASC\n450. Accruals . ASC 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency\nwhen it is \u201cprobable that one or more future events will occur\nconfirming the fact of loss\u201d and \u201cthe amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated.\u201d In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup\nestablishes accruals for contingencies, including any\nlitigation, regulatory or tax matters disclosed herein, when\nCitigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the\nreasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts,\nthe minimum amount of the range is accrued, unless some higher\namount within the range is a better estimate than any other\namount within the range. Once established, accruals are adjusted\nfrom time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional\ninformation. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation\nto those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the\namounts accrued for those matters. Disclosure . ASC 450 requires\ndisclosure of a loss contingency if \u201cthere is at least a\nreasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may\nhave been incurred\u201d and there is no accrual for the loss because\nthe conditions described above are not met or an exposure to\nloss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In accordance with\nASC 450, if Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because\nCitigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not\nprobable, or that a loss is probable but not reasonably\nestimable, and the reasonably possible loss is material, it\ndiscloses the loss contingency. In addition, Citigroup discloses\nmatters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably\npossible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the\namount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss\nor range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can\nbe made. ASC 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of\nthe reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate\ncannot be made. Neither accrual nor disclosure is required for\nlosses that are deemed remote.\n\nLitigation, Regulatory and Other Contingencies Overview. In\naddition to the matters described below, in the ordinary course\nof business, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and\ncurrent and former officers, directors and employees (for\npurposes of this section, sometimes collectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties) routinely are named as defendants\nin, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings.\nCertain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek\nrelief in connection with alleged violations of consumer\nprotection, fair lending, securities, banking, antifraud,\nantitrust, anti-money laundering, employment and other statutory\nand common laws. Certain of these actual or threatened legal\nactions and proceedings include claims for substantial or\nindeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for\ninjunctive relief, and in some instances seek recovery on a\nclass-wide basis. In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup\nand Related Parties also are subject to governmental and\nregulatory examinations, information-gathering requests,\ninvestigations and proceedings (both formal and informal),\ncertain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements,\nfines, penalties, restitution, disgorgement, injunctions or\nother relief. In addition, certain affiliates and subsidiaries\nof Citigroup are banks, registered broker-dealers, futures\ncommission merchants, investment advisors or other regulated\nentities and, in those capacities, are subject to regulation by\nvarious U.S., state and foreign securities, banking, commodity\nfutures, consumer protection and other regulators. In connection\nwith formal and informal inquiries by these regulators,\nCitigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries receive numerous\nrequests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony and\nother information in connection with various aspects of their\nregulated activities. From time to time Citigroup and Related\nParties also receive grand jury subpoenas and other requests for\ninformation or assistance, formal or informal, from federal or\nstate law enforcement agencies including, among others, various\nUnited States Attorneys\u2019 Offices, the Money Laundering and Asset\nRecovery Section and other divisions of the Department of\nJustice, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United\nStates Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation relating to Citigroup and its customers. Because\nof the global scope of Citigroup\u2019s operations and its presence\nin countries around the world, Citigroup and Related Parties are\nsubject to litigation and governmental and regulatory\nexaminations, information-gathering requests, investigations and\nproceedings (both formal and informal) in multiple jurisdictions\nwith legal, regulatory and tax regimes that may differ\nsubstantially, and present substantially different risks, from\nthose Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to in the United\nStates. In some instances, Citigroup and Related Parties may be\ninvolved in proceedings involving the same subject matter in\nmultiple jurisdictions, which may result in overlapping,\ncumulative or inconsistent outcomes. Citigroup seeks to resolve\nall litigation, regulatory, tax and other matters in the manner\nmanagement believes is in the best interests of Citigroup and\nits shareholders, and contests liability, allegations of\nwrongdoing and, where applicable, the amount of damages or scope\nof any penalties or other relief sought as appropriate in each\npending matter.\n                              299                               \nInherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed. Certain of the\nmatters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or\nindeterminate damages. The claims asserted in these matters\ntypically are broad, often spanning a multiyear period and\nsometimes a wide range of business activities, and the\nplaintiffs\u2019 or claimants\u2019 alleged damages frequently are not\nquantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement\nof claim. Other matters relate to regulatory investigations or\nproceedings, as to which there may be no objective basis for\nquantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or other\nremedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the\nloss in such matters, even if it believes that a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case,\nproceeding or investigation have yielded additional information\nsufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of\nreasonably possible loss. Such developments may include, among\nother things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties,\nrulings by the court on key issues, analysis by retained experts\nand engagement in settlement negotiations. Depending on a range\nof factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the novelty of\nthe legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court\u2019s\nscheduling order, the timing of court decisions and the adverse\nparty\u2019s, regulator\u2019s or other authority\u2019s willingness to\nnegotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it may be months or\nyears after the filing of a case or commencement of a proceeding\nor an investigation before an estimate of the range of\nreasonably possible loss can be made. Matters as to Which an\nEstimate Can Be Made . For some of the matters disclosed below,\nCitigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For\nsome of the matters included within this estimation, an accrual\nhas been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and\nreasonably estimable, but a reasonably possible exposure to loss\nexists in excess of the amount accrued. In these cases, the\nestimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in\nexcess of the accrued amount. For other matters included within\nthis estimation, no accrual has been made because a loss,\nalthough estimable, is believed to be reasonably possible, but\nnot probable; in these cases, the estimate reflects the\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss. As of December 31,\n2024, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued\nloss for these matters ranges up to approximately $ 1.3billion\nin the aggregate. These estimates are based on currently\navailable information. As available information changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and\nthe estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many\nestimates presented in financial statements and other financial\ndisclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably\npossible loss arising from litigation, regulatory and tax\nproceedings are subject to particular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making an estimate, (i) Citigroup may\nhave only preliminary, incomplete or inaccurate information\nabout the facts underlying the claim, (ii) its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the court, other tribunal or authority on\nsignificant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse\nparties, regulators or other authorities, may prove to be wrong\nand (iii) the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not\namenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative\nanalytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may\noccur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate\nbecause it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all of\nthese reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued\nin relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included\nin the estimate. Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made\n. For other matters disclosed below, Citigroup is not currently\nable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.\nMany of these matters remain in very preliminary stages (even in\nsome cases where a substantial period of time has passed since\nthe commencement of the matter), with few or no substantive\nlegal decisions by the court, tribunal or other authority\ndefining the scope of the claims, the class (if any) or the\npotentially available damages or other exposure, and fact\ndiscovery is still in progress or has not yet begun. In many of\nthese matters, Citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or\nstatement of claim or asserted its defenses, nor has it engaged\nin any negotiations with the adverse party (whether a regulator,\ntaxing authority or a private party). For all these reasons,\nCitigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss, if any, for these matters. Opinion of\nManagement as to Eventual Outcome. Subject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s management, based on current\nknowledge and after taking into account its current accruals,\nthat the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note\nwould not likely have a material adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless,\ngiven the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain\nof these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could,\nfrom time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular\nquarterly or annual periods. Foreign Exchange Matters In 2019,\ntwo applications, captioned MICHAEL O\u2019HIGGINS FX CLASS\nREPRESENTATIVE LIMITED v. BARCLAYS BANK PLC AND OTHERS and\nPHILLIP EVANS v. BARCLAYS BANK PLC AND OTHERS, were made to the\nU.K.\u2019s Competition Appeal Tribunal requesting permission to\ncommence collective proceedings against Citigroup, Citibank, and\nother defendants. On February 8, 2024, Michael O\u2019Higgins FX\nClass Representative Limited withdrew its application. The Evans\napplication seeks compensatory damages for losses alleged to\nhave arisen from the actions at issue in the European\nCommission\u2019s foreign exchange spot trading infringement decision\n(European Commission Decision of May 16, 2019 in Case\nAT.40135-FOREX (Three Way Banana Split) C(2019) 3631 final).\nAfter claimants appealed the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal\u2019s\njudgment on certification, the Court of Appeal issued a judgment\nin November 2023 that the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal\nshould not have declined to certify the proceedings. On April\n17, 2024, the U.K. Supreme Court granted the defendants\u2019\npermission to appeal the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment. On\nSeptember 2, 2024, the U.K. Supreme Court scheduled a\n                              300                               \nhearing of the appeal for April 1\u20132, 2025. Additional\ninformation concerning these actions is publicly available in\ncourt filings under the case numbers 1329/7/7/19 and 1336/7/7/19\nin the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, CA-2022-002002 and\nCA-2022-002003 in the Court of Appeal, and UKSC 2023/0177 in the\nU.K. Supreme Court. In 2019, a putative class action was filed\nagainst Citibank and other defendants, captioned J WISBEY &\nASSOCIATES PTY LTD v. UBS AG & ORS, in the Federal Court of\nAustralia. Plaintiffs allege that defendants manipulated the\nforeign exchange markets. Plaintiffs assert claims under\nantitrust laws and seek compensatory damages and declaratory and\ninjunctive relief. Additional information concerning this action\nis publicly available in court filings under the docket number\nVID567/2019. In 2019, two motions for certification of class\nactions filed against Citigroup, Citibank, Citicorp, and other\ndefendants were consolidated, under the caption GERTLER, ET AL.\nv. DEUTSCHE BANK AG, in the Tel Aviv Central District Court in\nIsrael. Plaintiffs allege that defendants manipulated the\nforeign exchange markets. In August 2021, Citibank\u2019s motion to\ndismiss plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification was denied. In\nApril 2022, the Supreme Court of Israel denied Citibank\u2019s motion\nfor leave to appeal the Central District Court\u2019s denial of its\nmotion to dismiss. On February 20, 2024, the parties filed a\nmotion for the Tel Aviv Central District Court to approve a\nsettlement. On September 15, 2024, the parties responded to\nobjections filed in connection with the proposed settlement. On\nDecember 26, 2024, the court held a hearing to consider whether\nto approve the settlement. Additional information concerning\nthis action is publicly available in court filings under the\ndocket number CA 29013-09-18. On December 13, 2021, a Dutch\nfoundation filed a writ of summons against Citigroup, Citibank,\nand other defendants, captioned STICHTING FX CLAIMS v. NATWEST\nMARKETS N.V., ET AL., in the Amsterdam District Court in the\nNetherlands. Claimant seeks damages on behalf of certain\ninstitutional investors for losses alleged to have arisen from\nthe actions at issue in the European Commission\u2019s foreign\nexchange spot trading infringement decision (European Commission\nDecision of May 16, 2019 in Case AT.40135- FOREX (Three Way\nBanana Split) C(2019) 3631 final). In March 2023, the court\ndismissed claims made on behalf of parties located outside the\nNetherlands and permitted the other claims to go forward.\nClaimant appealed that decision and in September 2023 and\nJanuary 2025 filed new writs of summons asserting similar claims\non behalf of additional institutional investors. Additional\ninformation concerning this action is publicly available in\ncourt filings under the case numbers C/13/718639 / HA ZA 22-460\nand C/13/743903 / HA ZA 23-1143 in the Amsterdam District Court\nand under the case number 200.329.379/01 in the Amsterdam Court\nof Appeal. Fund Administration Matter In 2016, an arbitration\nproceeding was commenced in Brazil\u2019s Market Arbitration Chamber\nagainst an asset manager of a Brazilian real estate investment\nfund and Citibank Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mob S.A.\n(Citi DTVM). The claimant alleged that the asset manager had\nengaged in fraud in connection with investments in real estate\nprojects and that Citi DTVM, as fund administrator, should be\nheld jointly and severally liable for its investment losses. In\n2020, the arbitration panel concluded that the asset manager had\nengaged in fraudulent activities in certain real estate projects\nand that Citi DTVM was jointly and severally liable pursuant to\nthe terms of the fund administration contract. The damages phase\nof the arbitration proceeding is ongoing. Greek Pension Claims\nBeginning in 2015, four claims were filed in the Court of First\nInstance of Athens by former Citi employees against Citibank\nEurope PLC (as a successor to Citibank International PLC, Athens\nbranch) regarding the treatment of their pension benefits\nfollowing the sale of Citi\u2019s consumer operations in Greece. In\nSOULTANA AGGELAKI & OTHERS v. CITIBANK EUROPE PUBLIC LIMITED\nCOMPANY, in February 2017, the Court of First Instance of Athens\nissued a decision rejecting the claims. In January 2019, the\nAthens Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Court of\nFirst Instance of Athens. On May 14, 2024, following the further\nappeal by the claimants, the Greek Supreme Court dismissed some\nclaims, allowed others to proceed, and referred others back to\nthe Athens Court of Appeal for further consideration of the\ncalculation methodology. The Court of Appeal held a hearing on\nFebruary 18, 2025. Additional information concerning this action\nis available in court filings under the docket numbers 70/2019\nin the Athens Court of Appeal and 430/2024 in the Greek Supreme\nCourt. In AGGELAKIS CHRISTOS & OTHERS v. CITIBANK EUROPE PUBLIC\nLIMITED COMPANY, in February 2017, the Court of First Instance\nof Athens dismissed the claims. On appeal, the Athens Court of\nAppeal initially stayed the case pending the outcome of the\nappeal filed with the Supreme Court in SOULTANA AGGELAKI &\nOTHERS v. CITIBANK EUROPE PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY and has now\nscheduled a hearing for March 18, 2025. Additional information\nis available in court filings under the docket number 4716/2020\nin the Athens Court of Appeal. In GIACHOUNTOUDI & OTHERS v.\nCITIBANK EUROPE PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY, on October 15, 2024, the\nCourt of First Instance of Athens issued a decision rejecting\nthe claims. The claimants have appealed, and the Court of Appeal\nhas scheduled a hearing for March 18, 2025. This matter is filed\nunder the docket numbers 2808/92/2019 in the Court of First\nInstance of Athens and 1086/771/2025 in the Athens Court of\nAppeal. In GLYKAS & OTHERS v. CITIBANK EUROPE PUBLIC LIMITED\nCOMPANY, in August 2017, the Court of First Instance of Athens\ndismissed the claims. On appeal, the Athens Court of Appeal\ninitially stayed the action pending the outcome of the appeal\nfiled with the Supreme Court in SOULTANA AGGELAKI & OTHERS v.\nCITIBANK EUROPE PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY and has scheduled a\nhearing for March 4, 2025. Additional information is available\nin court filings under the docket number 4717/2020 in the Athens\nCourt of Appeal.\n                              301                               \nInterbank Offered Rates-Related Litigation and Other Matters\nCitigroup and Citibank, along with other U.S. Dollar (USD) LIBOR\npanel banks, are defendants in a multi-district litigation\nproceeding before the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York captioned IN RE LIBOR-BASED\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The putative class\nactions and certain of the individual actions have been\ndismissed as to Citigroup and Citibank based on pretrial rulings\nor following settlements. Plaintiffs with surviving claims\nagainst Citigroup and Citibank assert claims under the Sherman\nAct and state law based on allegations that defendants\nsuppressed or otherwise manipulated USD LIBOR. Plaintiffs seek\ncompensatory damages and other relief. Additional information\nconcerning these actions and related actions and appeals is\npublicly available in court filings under the docket numbers 11\nMD 2262 (S.D.N.Y.) (Buchwald, J.) and 17-1569 (2d Cir.). In\nAugust 2020, individual borrowers and consumers of loans and\ncredit cards filed an action against Citigroup, Citibank, CGMI,\nand other defendants, captioned MCCARTHY, ET AL. v.\nINTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE, INC., ET AL., in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California.\nPlaintiffs allege that defendants conspired to fix ICE LIBOR,\nassert claims under the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, and\nseek declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and treble damages.\nIn October 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In\nOctober 2023, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss the amended complaint with prejudice for all claims\nagainst Citigroup, Citibank, and CGMI. On December 9, 2024, the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed\nthe district court\u2019s ruling in all respects. On December 24,\n2024, plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing en banc .\nAdditional information concerning this action is publicly\navailable in court filings under the docket numbers 20-CV-5832\n(N.D. Cal.) (Donato, J.) and 23-3458 (9th Cir.). Interchange Fee\nLitigation Beginning in 2005, several putative class actions\nwere filed against Citigroup, Citibank, and Citicorp, together\nwith Visa, MasterCard, and other banks and their affiliates, in\nvarious federal district courts and consolidated with other\nrelated individual cases in a multi-district litigation\nproceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York. This proceeding is captioned IN RE PAYMENT\nCARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND MERCHANT DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION.\nThe plaintiffs, merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard\nbranded payment cards, as well as various membership\nassociations that claim to represent certain groups of\nmerchants, allege, among other things, that defendants have\nengaged in conspiracies to set the price of interchange and\nmerchant discount fees on credit and debit card transactions and\nto restrain trade unreasonably through various Visa and\nMasterCard rules governing merchant conduct, all in violation of\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act and certain California statutes.\nPlaintiffs further allege violations of Section 2 of the Sherman\nAct. Supplemental complaints also were filed against defendants\nin the putative class actions alleging that Visa\u2019s and\nMasterCard\u2019s respective initial public offerings were\nanticompetitive and violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and\nthat MasterCard\u2019s initial public offering constituted a\nfraudulent conveyance. In 2014, the district court entered a\nfinal judgment approving the terms of a class settlement.\nVarious objectors appealed from the final class settlement\napproval order to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. In 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the\ndistrict court\u2019s approval of the class settlement and remanded\nfor further proceedings. The district court thereafter appointed\nseparate counsel for a putative class seeking damages and a\nputative class seeking injunctive relief. Amended or new\ncomplaints on behalf of the putative classes and various\nindividual merchants were subsequently filed, including a\nfurther amended complaint on behalf of a putative damages class\nand a new complaint on behalf of a putative injunctive class,\nboth of which named Citigroup, Citibank, and Citicorp LLC. In\naddition, numerous merchants have filed amended or new\ncomplaints against Visa, MasterCard, and in some instances one\nor more issuing banks, including Citigroup, Citibank, and\nCiticorp Payment Services. In 2019, the district court granted\nthe damages class plaintiffs\u2019 motion for final approval of a new\nsettlement with the defendants. The settlement involves the\ndamages class only and does not settle the claims of the\ninjunctive relief class or any actions brought on a non-class\nbasis by individual merchants. The settlement provides for a\ncash payment to the damages class of $ 6.24billion, later\nreduced by $ 700million based on the transaction volume of class\nmembers that opted out from the settlement. Several merchants\nand merchant groups appealed the final approval order. In\nSeptember 2021, the court granted the injunctive relief class\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify a non-opt-out class. On March 15,\n2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\naffirmed the district court\u2019s final approval of the damages\nclass settlement and remanded the case back to the district\ncourt for administration of the settlement claims process. On\nJanuary 8, 2024, the district court issued decisions on two\npending motions for summary judgment. It granted in part and\ndenied in part defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The\ndistrict court also denied Mastercard\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment as to Mastercard\u2019s lack of market power. From February\nto April 2024, the court issued opinions regarding the parties\u2019\nremaining respective summary judgment motions. On March 26,\n2024, the injunctive relief class plaintiffs filed a motion\nseeking preliminary approval of the parties\u2019 March 25, 2024,\nagreement to settle the injunctive relief class claims. On June\n25, 2024, the district court denied the motion for preliminary\napproval of the injunctive relief class settlement. Beginning on\nJune 25, 2024, the district court issued orders concluding the\nmulti-district litigation proceedings and remanding the cases to\nother districts in GRUBHUB HOLDINGS, INC., ET AL. v. VISA INC.,\nET AL.; MIRAGE WINE & SPIRITS, INC., ET AL. v. VISA INC., ET\nAL.; TARGET CORP., ET AL. v. VISA INC., ET AL.; and 7-ELEVEN,\nINC., ET AL. v. VISA INC., ET AL. Additional information\nconcerning these actions is publicly available in court filings\nunder the docket numbers 1:05-md-01720\n                              302                               \n(E.D.N.Y.)

Interest Rate and Credit\nDefault Swap Litigation Beginning in 2015, Citigroup, Citibank,\nCGMI, CGML and numerous other parties were named as defendants\nin a number of industry-wide putative class actions related to\ninterest rate swap (IRS) trading. These actions have been\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York under the caption IN RE INTEREST\nRATE SWAPS ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The actions allege that\ndefendants colluded to prevent the development of exchange-like\ntrading for IRS and assert federal and state antitrust claims\nand claims for unjust enrichment. Also consolidated under the\nsame caption are individual actions filed by swap execution\nfacilities, asserting federal and state antitrust claims, as\nwell as claims for unjust enrichment and tortious interference\nwith business relations. Plaintiffs in these actions seek treble\ndamages, fees, costs, and injunctive relief. Lead plaintiffs in\nthe class action moved for class certification in 2019 and\nsubsequently filed an amended complaint. On December 15, 2023,\nthe court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. On\nJuly 11, 2024, the district court granted preliminary approval\nof the parties\u2019 settlement of the class action. On October 10,\n2024, the district court issued an order granting the motion to\napprove preliminarily the plans of allocation and preliminarily\nproviding for notice to the settlement class. Additional\ninformation concerning these actions is publicly available in\ncourt filings under the docket numbers 18-CV-5361 (S.D.N.Y.)\n(Oetken, J.) and 16-MD-2704 (S.D.N.Y.) (Oetken, J.) and 24-81\n(2d Cir.). Madoff-Related Litigation In 2008, a Securities\nInvestor Protection Act (SIPA) trustee was appointed for the\nSIPA liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC\n(BLMIS) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York. Beginning in 2010, the SIPA trustee\ncommenced actions against multiple Citi entities, including\nCitibank, Citicorp North America, Inc., and CGML, captioned\nPICARD v. CITIBANK, N.A., ET AL., seeking recovery of monies\nthat originated at BLMIS and were allegedly received by the Citi\nentities as subsequent transferees. In February 2022, the SIPA\ntrustee filed an amended complaint against Citibank, Citicorp\nNorth America, Inc., and CGML. In April 2022, these Citi\nentities moved to dismiss the amended complaint, which the\nbankruptcy court denied. In November 2022, the remaining Citi\nentities moved to file an interlocutory appeal of the bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s decision, which the district court denied on March 14,\n2024, and answered the amended complaint.

Beginning in 2010,\nthe British Virgin Islands liquidators of Fairfield Sentry\nLimited, whose assets were invested with BLMIS, commenced\nmultiple actions against CGML, Citibank (Switzerland) AG,\nCitibank, NA London, Citivic Nominees Ltd., Cititrust Bahamas\nLtd., and Citibank Korea Inc., captioned FAIRFIELD SENTRY LTD.,\nET AL. v. CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS LTD., ET AL.; FAIRFIELD\nSENTRY LTD., ET AL. v. CITIBANK (SWITZERLAND) AG, ET AL.;\nFAIRFIELD SENTRY LTD., ET AL. v.

CITIVIC NOMINEES LTD., ET\nAL.; FAIRFIELD SENTRY LTD., ET AL. v. DON CHIMANGO SA, ET AL.;\nand FAIRFIELD SENTRY LTD., ET AL. v. CITIBANK KOREA INC. ET AL.,\nin the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District\nof New York. The actions seek recovery of monies that were\nallegedly received directly or indirectly from Fairfield Sentry.\nIn August 2022, the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York affirmed various decisions of the\nbankruptcy court, which dismissed claims against CGML, Citibank\n(Switzerland) AG, Citibank, NA London, Citivic Nominees Ltd.,\nCititrust Bahamas Ltd., and Citibank Korea Inc., and permitted a\nsingle claim against Citibank, NA London, CGML, Citivic Nominees\nLtd., and Citibank (Switzerland) AG to proceed. In September\n2022, the liquidators appealed the district court\u2019s decision\ndismissing the liquidators\u2019 claims. In September 2022, CGML,\nCitibank (Switzerland) AG, Citibank, NA London, and Citivic\nNominees Ltd. moved for leave to appeal the district court\u2019s\ndecision permitting the single claim to proceed against them. In\nJuly 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit granted CGML, Citibank (Switzerland) AG, Citivic\nNominees Ltd., and Citibank, NA London leave to appeal the\ndistrict court\u2019s decision permitting a single claim to proceed\nagainst them and ordered those appeals to be heard in tandem\nwith the liquidators\u2019 pending consolidated direct appeal. In May\n2023, the liquidators voluntarily dismissed the single pending\nclaim against Citibank (Switzerland) AG and Citivic Nominees\nLtd. without prejudice, but the action continued against other\ndefendants. On January 9, 2025, the liquidators voluntarily\ndismissed the entire action with prejudice, thereby permanently\ndisposing of the single pending claim the liquidators previously\nvoluntarily dismissed without prejudice. The claims previously\ndismissed by the bankruptcy court against Citibank (Switzerland)\nAG and Citivic Nominees Ltd. remain subject to the pending\nconsolidated direct appeal in the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit and are unaffected by the liquidators\u2019\nvoluntary dismissals.

Parmalat Litigation\nIn 2004, an Italian commissioner appointed to oversee the\nadministration of various Parmalat companies filed a complaint\nagainst Citigroup, Citibank, and related parties, alleging that\nthe defendants facilitated a number of frauds by Parmalat\ninsiders. In 2008, a jury rendered a verdict in Citigroup\u2019s\nfavor and awarded Citi $ 431million. In 2019, the Italian\nSupreme Court affirmed the decision in the full amount of $\n431million. Citigroup has taken steps to enforce the judgment in\nItalian and Belgian courts. Additional information concerning\nthese actions is publicly available in court filings under the\ndocket numbers 27618/2014, 4133/2019, 22098/2019, and 3023/2024\n(Italy), and 20/3617/A, 20/4007/A, and C.24.266.T (Belgium). In\n2015, Parmalat filed a claim in an Italian civil court in Milan\nclaiming damages of \u20ac 1.8billion against Citigroup, Citibank,\nand related parties. The Milan court dismissed Parmalat\u2019s claim\non grounds that it was duplicative of Parmalat\u2019s previously\nunsuccessful claims. In 2019, the Milan Court of Appeal rejected\nParmalat\u2019s appeal of the Milan court\u2019s dismissal. In June 2019,\nParmalat filed a further appeal with the Italian Supreme Court,\nand a hearing took place in November 2024. Additional\ninformation concerning this action is publicly available in\ncourt filings under the docket numbers 1009/2018 and 20598/2019.\nOn January 29, 2020, Parmalat, its three directors, and its sole\nshareholder, Sofil S.a.s., as co-plaintiffs, filed a claim\nbefore the Italian civil court in Milan seeking a declaratory\njudgment that they do not owe compensatory damages of \u20ac\n990million to Citibank. On November 5, 2020, Citibank joined the\nproceedings, seeking dismissal of the declaratory judgment\napplication and raised a counterclaim, seeking \u20ac 990million as\ndamages. These proceedings are currently stayed. Additional\ninformation concerning this action is publicly available in\ncourt filings under the docket number 8611/2020. Shareholder\nDerivative and Securities Litigation Beginning in October 2020,\nfour derivative actions were filed in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York, purportedly on\nbehalf of Citigroup (as nominal defendant) against certain of\nCitigroup\u2019s current and former directors. The actions were later\nconsolidated under the case name IN RE CITIGROUP INC.\nSHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. The consolidated complaint\nasserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,\nand contribution and indemnification in connection with\ndefendants\u2019 alleged failures to implement adequate internal\ncontrols. In addition, the consolidated complaint asserts\nderivative claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with\nstatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2019 and 2020 annual meeting proxy\nstatements. In February 2021, the court stayed the action\npending resolution of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in IN RE\nCITIGROUP SECURITIES LITIGATION. In April 2023, after\ndefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was granted in IN RE CITIGROUP\nSECURITIES LITIGATION, the court maintained the stay in this\naction pending resolution of the securities plaintiffs\u2019 motion\nfor leave to amend the complaint and, if leave is granted, any\nsubsequent motion to dismiss. Additional information concerning\nthis action is publicly available in court filings under the\ndocket number 1:20-CV-09438 (S.D.N.Y.) (Preska, J.).

The actions were later consolidated under the case\nname IN RE CITIGROUP INC. DERIVATIVE LITIGATION, and the court\nstayed the action pending resolution of defendants\u2019 motion to\ndismiss in IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES LITIGATION. In April 2023,\na third related derivative action also filed in the Supreme\nCourt of the State of New York was consolidated for all purposes\ninto this action. That same month, following the dismissal of\nthe securities complaint in IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES\nLITIGATION, the court maintained the stay in this action pending\nresolution of the securities plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to\namend the complaint and, if leave is granted, any subsequent\nmotion to dismiss. Additional information concerning this action\nis publicly available in court filings under the docket number\n656759/2020 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (Schecter, J.).

The action raises substantially the same claims and\nallegations as IN RE CITIGROUP INC. SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE\nLITIGATION. The LIPSHUTZ action additionally asserts that\nplaintiffs made a litigation demand on the Citigroup Board of\nDirectors and that the demand was wrongfully refused. In May\n2023, on defendants\u2019 motion, the action was transferred to the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork so that it could be litigated along with IN RE CITIGROUP\nINC. SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE\n                              304                               \nLITIGATION and IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES LITIGATION.

The actions were\nconsolidated under the case name IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES\nLITIGATION. The consolidated complaint later added certain of\nCitigroup\u2019s current and former directors as defendants.

The amended\ncomplaint alleges a conspiracy to fix prices in the Mexican\nsovereign bond market, asserts antitrust and unjust enrichment\nclaims, and seeks treble damages, restitution, and injunctive\nrelief. In November 2020, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion\nto dismiss, and the plaintiffs appealed.

Prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023, a TDR was\ndeemed to occur when the\nCompany modified the original\nterms of a loan agreement by\ngranting a concession to a\nborrower that was experiencing\nfinancial difficulty. Loans\nwith short-term and other\ninsignificant modifications\nthat are not considered\nconcessions were not TDRs. The\naccounting guidance for TDRs\nwas eliminated with the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02.
