Additional\nInformation Additional\ninformation about Citigroup is\navailable on Citi\u2019s website at\nwww.citigroup.com. Citigroup\u2019s\nannual reports on Form 10-K,\nquarterly reports on Form\n10-Q, current reports on Form\n8-K and proxy statements, as\nwell as other filings with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) are available\nfree of charge through Citi\u2019s\nwebsite by clicking on \u201cSEC\nFilings\u201d under the \u201cInvestors\u201d\ntab. The SEC\u2019s website also\ncontains these filings and\nother information regarding\nCiti at www.sec.gov. Certain\nreclassifications have been\nmade to the prior periods\u2019\nfinancial statements and\ndisclosures to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation,\nincluding, effective January\n1, 2025, certain transaction\nprocessing fees paid by Citi,\nprimarily to credit card\nnetworks, reported within U.S.\nPersonal Banking (USPB) ,\nServices , Wealth and All\nOther \u2014Legacy Franchises\n(Mexico Consumer/SBMM\n(Banamex) and Asia Consumer),\nwhich were previously\npresented within Other\noperating expenses and are now\npresented as contra-revenue\nwithin Commissions and fees\nreported in Non-interest\nrevenue . Prior periods were\nconformed to reflect this\nchange in presentation. Also\neffective January 1, 2025,\nUSPB changed its reporting for\ncertain installment lending\nproducts that were transferred\nfrom Retail Banking to Branded\nCards to reflect where these\nproducts are managed. Prior\nperiods were conformed to\nreflect this change.\nPlease see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of material risks\nand uncertainties that could\nimpact Citigroup\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures Citi prepares its financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or\notherwise include components that differ from the most directly\ncomparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for\nGAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the\nsame way as non-GAAP measures with similar names used by other\ncompanies. Citi\u2019s non-GAAP measures in this Form 10-Q include: \u2022\nExpenses excluding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) special assessment and/or divestiture-related impacts \u2022\nAll Other (managed basis), which excludes divestiture-related\nimpacts \u2022 Revenues excluding divestiture-related impacts \u2022\nBanking and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gain (loss) on\nloan hedges \u2022 Tangible common equity (TCE), return on tangible\ncommon equity (RoTCE) and tangible book value per share (TBVPS)\n\u2022 Non- Markets net interest income For more information on the\nFDIC special assessment, see \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and Note 17\nbelow. Citi believes its results excluding the FDIC special\nassessment are useful to investors, industry analysts and others\nin evaluating Citi\u2019s results of operations and comparing its\noperational performance between periods, by providing a\nmeaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-\nto-period operating results, particularly given the outsized\nimpact of this item, as well as additional comparability to peer\ncompanies. Citi\u2019s revenues and expenses excluding divestiture-\nrelated impacts represent as reported, or GAAP, financial\nresults adjusted for items that are incurred and recognized,\nwhich are wholly and necessarily a consequence of actions taken\nto sell (including through a public offering), dispose of or\nwind down business activities associated with Citi\u2019s previously\nannounced exit markets within All Other \u2014Legacy Franchises.\nCiti\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision\nmaker, regularly reviews financial information for All Other on\na managed basis that excludes these divestiture-related impacts.\nFor more information on Citi\u2019s results excluding divestiture-\nrelated impacts, see \u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and \u201c All Other\n\u2014Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)\u201d below.

This is the fourth\nconsecutive quarter of\npositive operating leverage\nfor Citi at the company-wide\nlevel. Citi\u2019s positive\noperating leverage was driven\nby revenue growth of 3% and\ndisciplined expense management\n(down 5%). Excluding the\nimpact of FDIC special\nassessments and divestiture-\nrelated expenses in both\nperiods, total expenses\ndecreased 3% compared to the\nprior-year period.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to advance\nits transformation, including,\namong other things, making key\ninvestments to consolidate and\nmodernize its infrastructure,\nretiring legacy applications\nand automating high-priority\nmanual reconciliations. (See\n\u201cCiti\u2019s Multiyear\nTransformation\u201d below.)\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $2.8 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends ($1.1\nbillion), as well as share\nrepurchases ($1.75 billion)\nunder its multiyear $20\nbillion common stock\nrepurchase program.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) Capital ratio under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach was 13.4% as of March\n31, 2025, approximately 130\nbasis points above its current\nrequired regulatory minimum.\n\n\u2022 As part of its strategic\nrefresh, Citi continued to\nmake progress with the wind-\ndowns of its Korea consumer\nbanking operations and its\noverall operations in Russia,\nas well as the preparation for\na planned initial public\noffering (IPO) of its consumer\nbanking and small business and\nmiddle-market banking\noperations in Mexico (Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM (Banamex)).\n                                                                \n  First Quarter of 2025 Results Summary                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti reported net income of\n$4.1 billion, or $1.96 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $3.4 billion, or $1.58 per\nshare in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nNet income increased 21%\nversus the prior-year period,\ndriven by higher revenues and\nlower expenses, partially\noffset by higher cost of\ncredit. Citi\u2019s effective tax\nrate was approximately 25% in\nboth the current and prior-\nyear periods. Average diluted\nshares outstanding decreased\n1%.\n\nCiti\u2019s revenues of $21.6\nbillion in the first quarter\nof 2025 increased 3% versus\nthe prior-year period, on a\nreported basis. The increase\nincluded no divestiture-\nrelated impacts in the current\nquarter and $(12) million in\nthe prior-year period.\nExcluding the divestiture-\nrelated impact in the prior-\nyear period, revenues also\nincreased 3%, driven by growth\nacross each of Citi\u2019s five\nbusinesses, largely offset by\na decline in All\n\nOther (managed basis). (For\nadditional information on the\ndivestiture-related impacts,\nsee \u201c All Other \u2014Divestiture-\nRelated Impacts (Reconciling\nItems)\u201d below.)\n\nCiti\u2019s average loans were $691\nbillion, up 2% versus the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by growth in Retail\nBanking and Branded Cards in\nUSPB as well as higher loans\nin Markets and Services ,\npartially offset by lower\nloans in Banking and Wealth .\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s loans by\nbusiness, including drivers\nand loan trends, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u2014Loans\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s average deposits were\napproximately $1.3 trillion,\ndown 2% versus the prior-year\nperiod, driven by an increase\nin Services that was more than\noffset by lower deposits in\nAll Other (managed basis),\nUSPB , Markets and Wealth .\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s deposits by\nbusiness, including drivers\nand deposit trends, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cLiquidity\nRisk\u2014Deposits\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s operating expenses of\n$13.4 billion decreased 5%\nfrom the prior-year period.\nThe decrease included\ndivestiture-related impacts of\n$34 million and an FDIC\nspecial assessment of $20\nmillion in the current\nquarter. This compares to\ndivestiture-related impacts of\n$110 million and an FDIC\nspecial assessment of $251\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod. Excluding divestiture-\nrelated impacts and the FDIC\nspecial assessments in both\nperiods, expenses decreased\n3%, largely driven by the\nabsence of a restructuring\ncharge and lower compensation\nexpenses, which benefited from\na favorable foreign exchange\n(FX) translation impact. These\ndrivers were partially offset\nby increases in\ntechnology/communications and\nprofessional services expenses\nrelated to Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, as well as\nadvertising and marketing\nexpense.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was $2.7 billion,\ncompared to $2.4 billion in\nthe prior-year period. The\nincrease was largely driven by\na higher net build in the\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL) related to uncertainty\nand deterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook in the\ncurrent quarter relative to\nthe prior-year period and\nhigher net credit losses in\nthe card portfolios in USPB .\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u2014Citi\u2019s\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n(ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $2.5\nbillion increased 7% from the\nprior-year period. Consumer\nnet credit losses of $2.3\nbillion increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by the card\nportfolios in USPB . Corporate\nnet credit losses were $182\nmillion versus $164 million in\nthe prior-year period.\n\nSubject to continued evolving\nmacroeconomic conditions, Citi\nexpects to continue to\nexperience an elevated net\ncredit loss rate for full-year\n2025 in line with 2024, with\nhigher loss rates in the first\nhalf of the year in Branded\nCards and Retail\n                               7                                \nServices consistent with\nseasonal patterns. Citi also\nexpects that its future ACL\nbuilds during the remainder of\n2025 will be a function of\nboth the macroeconomic\nenvironment and business\nvolumes, among other factors.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\ndecreased to 13.4% as of March\n31, 2025, compared to 13.5% as\nof March 31, 2024, based on\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets (RWA). The\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby the payment of common and\npreferred dividends, common\nshare repurchases, an increase\nin RWA and net adverse\nmovements in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (AOCI) ,\nlargely offset by net income.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025,\nCiti repurchased $1.75 billion\nof common shares and paid $1.1\nbillion of common dividends\n(see \u201cUnregistered Sales of\nEquity Securities, Repurchases\nof Equity Securities and\nDividends\u201d below).

Services revenues of\n$4.9 billion increased 3%,\ndriven by growth in Treasury\nand Trade Solutions (TTS). Net\ninterest income increased 5%,\ndriven by higher deposit\nspreads, as well as an\nincrease in deposit and loan\nbalances. Non-interest revenue\ndecreased 4%, driven by a\ndecline in Securities Services\ndue to the presence of certain\nepisodic fees in the prior-\nyear period, as well as higher\nrevenue share and the impact\nof FX translation in both TTS\nand Securities Services,\npartially offset by continued\nstrength in underlying fee\ndrivers across both\nbusinesses.\n\nTTS revenues of $3.6 billion\nincreased 4%, driven by a 5%\nincrease in net interest\nincome, partially offset by a\n2% decrease in non-interest\nrevenue. The increase in net\ninterest income was driven by\nhigher deposit spreads, as\nwell as increases in both\ndeposit and loan balances. The\ndecrease in non-interest\nrevenue was driven by the\nimpact of higher revenue share\nand FX translation, primarily\noffset by an increase in\ncross-border transaction value\nof 5%, an increase in U.S.\ndollar clearing volume of 8%\nand an increase in commercial\ncard spend volume of 2%.\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nof $1.2 billion were largely\nunchanged versus the prior-\nyear period. Net interest\nincome increased 7% on higher\ndeposit balances, which was\noffset by a 6% decrease in\nnon-interest revenue. The\ndecrease in non-interest\nrevenue was driven by the\npresence of certain episodic\nfees in the prior-year period,\nthe impact of FX translation\nand higher revenue share,\npartially offset by increases\nin assets under custody and\nadministration.\n\nServices expenses of $2.6\nbillion decreased 3%, largely\ndriven by lower deposit\ninsurance costs, severance and\nlegal expenses. Cost of credit\nwas $51 million, compared to\n$64 million in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nServices in the first quarter\nof 2025, see \u201c Services \u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  Markets                                                       \n                                                                \nMarkets net income of $1.8\nbillion increased 27% from the\nprior-year period, driven by\nhigher revenues, partially\noffset by higher expenses.\n\nMarkets revenues of $6.0\nbillion increased 12%, driven\nby an 8% increase in Fixed\nIncome Markets and a 23%\nincrease in Equity Markets.\nThe increase in Fixed Income\nMarkets was driven by growth\nacross rates and currencies,\nas well as spread products and\nother fixed income. Rates and\ncurrencies increased 9%,\nlargely driven by increased\nclient and trading activity.\nSpread products and other\nfixed income increased 7%,\ndriven by higher client\nactivity and loan growth,\nmainly in spread products. The\nincrease in Equity Markets was\nprimarily driven by equity\nderivatives, on increased\nmarket volatility and higher\nclient activity, and momentum\nin prime services, with prime\nbalances up approximately 16%.\n\nMarkets expenses of $3.5\nbillion increased 2%, driven\nby higher volume and other\nrevenue-related expenses.

In April 2025,\nthe U.S. administration\nannounced a 10% baseline\ntariff on imports from nearly\nall U.S. trading partners, as\nwell as additional\nindividualized \u201creciprocal\u201d\ntariffs, which after\nretaliatory measures have\nresulted in tariffs as high as\n145% on Chinese imports. The\nU.S. administration\nsubsequently delayed most\ntariffs above the 10% baseline\n(excluding China) for 90 days\nto allow for negotiations. The\nU.S. administration has also\nimplemented separate tariffs\non Mexico and Canada, as well\nas on automobile, steel and\naluminum imports, among\nothers. Certain U.S. trading\npartners have announced\nretaliatory tariffs in\nresponse.

Other \u2014Legacy Franchises\n(Mexico Consumer/SBMM (Banamex) and Asia Consumer), which were\npreviously presented within Other operating expenses, are\npresented as contra-revenue within Commissions and fees reported\nin Non-interest revenue . Prior periods were conformed to\nreflect this change in presentation.\n\n(2) The return on average common stockholders\u2019 equity is\ncalculated using net income less preferred stock dividends\ndivided by average common stockholders\u2019 equity. The return on\naverage total Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity is calculated using\nnet income divided by average Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(3) RoTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

Positive\noperating leverage indicates that the revenue growth rate was\ngreater than the expense growth rate.\n\n(5) Citi\u2019s binding CET1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were\nderived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas\nCiti\u2019s binding Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches framework for both periods presented.\n\n(6) Dividends declared per common share as a percentage of net\nincome per diluted share.\n\n(7) Total common dividends declared plus common share\nrepurchases as a percentage of net income available to common\nshareholders ( Net income less preferred dividends).

The\nincrease in net interest\nincome was driven by higher\ndeposit spreads, as well as an\nincrease in deposit and loan\nbalances. Average deposits\nincreased 1%, driven by North\nAmerica, partially offset by a\ndecline in International. The\ndecrease in non-interest\nrevenue was driven by higher\nrevenue share with Banking\u2014\nCorporate Lending and the\nimpact of FX translation,\nprimarily offset by growth in\nunderlying fee drivers,\nincluding cross-border\ntransaction value (up 5%),\nU.S. dollar clearing volume\n(up 8%) and commercial card\nspend volume (up 2%).\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nwere largely unchanged, as a\n6% decrease in non-interest\nrevenue was offset by a 7%\nincrease in net interest\nincome, driven by higher\ndeposit balances. Average\ndeposits increased 10%,\nreflecting growth in both\nNorth America and\nInternational. The decrease in\nnon-interest revenue was\ndriven by the presence of\ncertain episodic\n                               17                               \nfees in the prior-year period,\nalong with the impact of FX\ntranslation and higher revenue\nshare with Banking \u2014Corporate\nLending. The impact of these\ndrivers was partially offset\nby 9% growth in AUC/AUA, which\nbenefited from higher market\nvaluations, new client\nonboarding and deepening of\nrelationships with existing\nclients.\n\nExpenses decreased 3%, largely\ndriven by lower deposit\ninsurance costs, severance and\nlegal expenses.\n\nProvisions were $51 million,\ncompared to $64 million in the\nprior-year period, driven by a\nlower net ACL build on loans\nand unfunded lending\ncommitments of $18 million,\ncompared to $46 million in the\nprior-year period.\n\nThe current-quarter net ACL\nbuild of $45 million was\ndriven by uncertainty and\ndeterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook and an\nincrease in transfer risk\nassociated with unremittable\ncorporate dividends outside\nthe U.S. being held on behalf\nof clients, driven by safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law.

ECM fees were down\n26% amid a decline in the\nmarket wallet for follow-ons\nand convertibles, partially\noffset by an increase in IPO\nactivity.

Citigold,\nPrivate Bank and Wealth at\nWork. Net interest income\nincreased 30%, driven by\ngrowth in deposit spreads,\npartially offset by lower\ndeposit balances. Non-interest\nrevenue increased 16%,\nprimarily driven by higher\ninvestment fee revenues on\ngrowth in client investment\nassets.\n\nClient balances increased 7%,\ndriven by higher client\ninvestment assets (up 16%),\nreflecting strong net new\ninvestment assets (NNIA)\ngeneration and higher market\nvaluations. NNIA increased\n$16.5 billion in the quarter\nand more than $56 billion in\nthe last 12 months,\nrepresenting 11% organic\ngrowth.\n\nAverage deposits decreased 2%,\ndriven by a shift in deposits\nto higher-yielding investments\non the Wealth platform and\nother operating outflows,\nlargely offset by client\ntransfers to Citigold from\nUSPB ($14 billion at the time\nof transfer over the last 12\nmonths). Average loans\ndecreased 2%, driven by the\ntransfers of certain\nrelationships and associated\nmortgage loans to USPB from\nWealth , largely offset by\ngrowth in secured lending\nvolumes.\n\nPrivate Bank revenues\nincreased 16%, primarily\ndriven by higher deposit\nspreads and higher investment\nfee revenues, partially offset\nby lower deposit balances.\n\nCitigold revenues increased\n24%, driven by higher deposit\nspreads, higher investment fee\nrevenues and higher lending\nrevenues, partially offset by\nlower deposit balances.\n\nWealth at Work revenues\nincreased 48%, driven by\nhigher deposit spreads, higher\nlending revenues and higher\ninvestment fee revenues.\n\nExpenses were unchanged from\nthe prior-year period, as the\nbenefits from prior\nrepositioning as well as lower\ntechnology expenses were\noffset by higher revenue-\nrelated expenses and higher\nseverance.\n\nProvisions were $98 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $170\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by a net ACL\nbuild related to uncertainty\nand deterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook in the\ncurrent quarter, compared to\nan ACL release in the prior-\nyear period.

Branded Cards\naverage loans increased 5%,\nreflecting the higher card\nspend volume and higher\nrevolving balances.\n\nRetail Services revenues\ndecreased 11%, primarily\ndriven by lower non-interest\nrevenue due to the higher\npartner payment accruals,\npartially offset by higher net\ninterest revenue on growth in\ninterest-earning balances.\nRetail Services average loans\ndecreased 1%, largely\nreflecting lower card spend\nvolume. Card spend volume\ndecreased 5%, primarily due to\ncontinued lower in-store foot\ntraffic.\n\nRetail Banking revenues\nincreased 17%, driven by the\nimpact of higher deposit\nspreads, largely offset by the\ndeposit impact from client\ntransfers to Wealth . Average\ndeposits decreased 11%,\nlargely reflecting the\ntransfers of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits to Wealth\n($14 billion at the time of\ntransfer over the last 12\nmonths).\n\nExpenses were unchanged, as\ncontinued productivity savings\nwere offset by higher\nadvertising and marketing as\nwell as legal expenses.\n\nProvisions were $1.8 billion,\ncompared to $2.2 billion in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby a net ACL release on loans\nof $171 million, compared to a\nnet build of $337 million in\nthe prior-year period. The\ndecrease in Provisions was\npartially offset by higher net\ncredit losses in the card\nportfolios.\n\nNet credit losses of $2.0\nbillion increased 6%,\nprimarily reflecting the\ncontinued maturation of\nmultiple cards loan vintages\noriginated in recent years.\nThe maturation was delayed by\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus during the\npandemic. In addition, the\nyear-over-year increase was\ndriven by macroeconomic\npressures related to the\nelevated inflationary and\ninterest rate environment\nimpacting both cards\nportfolios. Branded Cards net\ncredit losses for credit cards\nwere up 11% to $1.1 billion,\nand Retail Services net credit\nlosses for credit cards were\nunchanged at $0.8 billion.\n\nThe net ACL release was $172\nmillion in the current\nquarter, driven by lower cards\nbalances, primarily offset by\nan ACL build for changes in\nportfolio composition,\nuncertainty and deterioration\nin the macroeconomic outlook\nand the impact of\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment.

revenues\ndecreased to $(176) million,\ncompared to $557 million in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby lower net interest income\nand the impact of valuation\nadjustments on certain\ninvestments and

The proposal would also\nchange the annual effective date of the SCB requirement from\nOctober 1 to January 1 in each year. If adopted as proposed, the\nchanges to the calculation of the SCB requirement would be\neffective beginning with the 2025 supervisory stress test, such\nthat the maximum CET1 Capital declines projected in the 2024 and\n2025 supervisory stress tests for Citi would be averaged in\nproducing Citi\u2019s new SCB requirement, which would be effective\nJanuary 1, 2026.

Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citi believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of March 31,\n2025. Citi has applied\nmanagement judgment to adjust\ninternal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been observed.\n                               45                               \nAs obligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

The results of the\nmark-to-market and any\nrealized gains or losses on\ncredit derivatives are\nreflected primarily in\nPrincipal transactions in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome. At March 31, 2025,\nDecember 31, 2024 and March\n31, 2024, Banking had economic\nhedges on the corporate credit\nportfolio of $38.8 billion,\n$37.8 billion and $38.4\nbillion, respectively. Citi\u2019s\nexpected credit loss model\nused in the calculation of its\nACL does not include the\nfavorable impact of credit\nderivatives and other\nmitigants that are marked-to-\nmarket. In addition, the\nreported amounts of direct\noutstandings and unfunded\nlending commitments in the\ntables above do not reflect\nthe impact of these hedging\ntransactions.

The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate was\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and decreased year-\nover-year.

The\nportfolio is generally\ndelinquency managed, where\nCiti evaluates credit risk\nbased on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 14. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe first quarter of 2025 net\ncredit loss rate for Retail\nBanking was broadly stable\nyear-over-year and decreased\nquarter-over-quarter. The\nquarter-over-quarter decrease\nwas driven by a reduction in\nthe consumer overdraft loss\nrate. The 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate was broadly\nstable quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year.\n          \n  Wealth  \n          \nWealth provides consumer\nmortgages, margin lending,\ncredit cards and other lending\nproducts to customer segments\nthat range from affluent to\nultra-high net worth through\nthe Private Bank, Citigold and\nWealth at Work businesses.\nThese customer segments\nrepresent a target market that\nis characterized by\nhistorically low default rates\nand delinquencies and includes\nloans that are delinquency\nmanaged or classifiably\nmanaged. The delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio consists\nprimarily of mortgages, margin\nlending and credit cards. As\nof March 31, 2025,\napproximately $45 billion, or\n30%, of the portfolios were\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of\nmortgage loans, margin loans,\npersonal and small business\nloans and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit risk\nbased on their internal risk\nrating, of which 69% were\nrated investment grade. While\nthe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rates shown in the\nchart above were calculated\nonly for the delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio, the net\ncredit loss rates presented\nwere calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe first quarter of 2025 net\ncredit loss rate in Wealth was\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year.\nThe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate was broadly\nstable quarter-over-quarter\nand increased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by consumer\nmortgages. The low net credit\nloss and the 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rates continued to\nreflect the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\n                               52                               \n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Banamex and\nprovides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nMexico Consumer serves a mass-\nmarket segment in Mexico and\nfocuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As of March\n31, 2025, approximately 40% of\nMexico Consumer EOP loans\nconsisted of credit card\nloans, which largely drives\nthe overall credit performance\nof Mexico Consumer, as the\ncards net credit losses\nrepresented approximately 65%\nof total Mexico Consumer net\ncredit losses for the first\nquarter of 2025. As presented\nin the chart above, the first\nquarter of 2025 net credit\nloss rate in Mexico Consumer\nincreased quarter-over-\nquarter, driven by a $13\nmillion charge-off for\nuncollectible value added tax\non accrued interest and an\nincrease in settlements. The\nnet credit loss rate increased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the ongoing\nnormalization of loss and\ndelinquency rates from post-\npandemic lows. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate was\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and increased year-\nover-year. The year-over-year\nincrease was driven by the\nongoing normalization of loss\nand delinquency rates from\npost-pandemic lows.

For all other non-\naccrual loans, cash interest\nreceipts are generally\nrecorded as revenue.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  of                                                            \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  no\u2026                                                           \n  lo\u2026       Mar.

Corporate non-accrual loans\nmay still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency.

The\nliquidity risk management\nframework provides that, in\naddition to the aggregate\nrequirements, certain entities\nbe self-sufficient or net\nproviders of liquidity,\nincluding in conditions\nestablished under their\ndesignated stress tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s primary funding sources\ninclude (i) corporate and\nconsumer deposits via Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries, including\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank),\n(ii) long-term debt (primarily\nsenior and subordinated debt)\nmainly issued by Citigroup\nInc., as the parent, and\nCitibank, and (iii)\nstockholders\u2019 equity. These\nsources may be supplemented by\nshort-term borrowings,\nprimarily in the form of\nsecured funding transactions.\n\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nframework, working in concert\nwith overall asset/liability\nmanagement, helps ensure that\nthere is sufficient liquidity\nand tenor in the overall\nliability structure (including\nfunding products) of the\nCompany relative to the\nliquidity requirements of\nCiti\u2019s assets. This reduces\nthe risk that liabilities will\nbecome due before assets\nmature or are monetized. The\nCompany holds excess\nliquidity, primarily in the\nform of high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA), as presented in\nthe table below.\n                               63                               \n                                                                \n  High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nNote: The amounts in the table\nabove are presented on an\naverage basis. For securities,\nthe amounts represent the\nliquidity value that\npotentially could be realized\nand, therefore, exclude any\nsecurities that are encumbered\nand incorporate any haircuts\napplicable under the U.S. LCR\nrule. The table above\nincorporates various\nrestrictions that could limit\nthe transferability of\nliquidity between legal\nentities, including Section\n23A of the Federal Reserve\nAct. Changes in HQLA line\ncategories from the prior-year\nperiod were primarily driven\nby the reallocation of\nnontransferable HQLA, which\ndid not change total average\nHQLA, and thus did not impact\nCiti\u2019s LCR ratio.\n\n(1) Foreign government debt\nincludes securities issued or\nguaranteed by foreign\nsovereigns, agencies and\nmultilateral development\nbanks. Foreign government debt\nsecurities are held largely to\nsupport local liquidity\nrequirements and Citi\u2019s local\nfranchises and principally\ninclude government bonds from\nJapan, Korea, the United\nKingdom, Mexico and China.\n\nThe table above includes\naverage amounts of HQLA held\nat Citigroup\u2019s operating\nentities that are eligible for\ninclusion in the calculation\nof Citigroup\u2019s consolidated\nLCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR\nrules. These amounts include\nthe HQLA needed to meet the\nminimum requirements at these\nentities as well as any\namounts in excess of these\nminimums that are available to\nbe transferred to other\nentities within Citigroup.\nCitigroup\u2019s average HQLA\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nas of the first quarter of\n2025, primarily driven by a\ndecrease in average wholesale\nfunding.

In\ngeneral, an institution\u2019s\navailable stable funding\nincludes portions of equity,\ndeposits and long-term debt,\nwhile its required stable\nfunding is based on the\nliquidity characteristics of\nits assets, derivatives and\ncommitments.

Citi\u2019s deposit\nbase is spread across a\ndiversified set of countries,\nindustries, clients and\ncurrencies and is subject to\nCiti\u2019s Liquidity Risk\nManagement Policy and\nProcedures. End-of-period\ndeposits increased 1% year-\nover-year, driven by increases\nin Services , partially offset\nby declines in Wealth , All\nOther and USPB . End-of-period\ndeposits increased 2%\nsequentially, driven by\nServices and USPB , partially\noffset by a decline in Wealth.\nOn an average basis, deposits\ndecreased 2% year-over-year\nand decreased 1% sequentially.\nIn the first quarter of 2025,\naverage deposits for: \u2022\nServices increased 2% year-\nover-year, as TTS increased\n1%, due to deepened client\nrelationships and growth in\noperational deposits, and\nSecurities Services increased\n10%, driven by growth in\nCustody and Issuer Services. \u2022\nUSPB decreased 11% year-over-\nyear, as the transfer of\ncertain relationships and the\nassociated deposits to Wealth\nmore than offset underlying\ndeposit growth. \u2022 Wealth\ndecreased 2% year-over-year,\ndriven by a shift in deposits\nto higher-yielding investments\non Citi\u2019s platform and other\noperating outflows, largely\noffset by the transfer of\ncertain relationships and\nassociated deposits from USPB\n. \u2022 All Other decreased 16%\nyear-over-year, primarily\nreflecting the continued wind-\ndowns, the impact of FX\ntranslation of deposits in\nLegacy Franchises and\nreductions of corporate\ncertificates of deposit in\nCorporate/Other.\n                               65                               \nThe majority of Citi\u2019s $1.3\ntrillion of end-of-period\ndeposits are institutional\n(approximately $851 billion)\nand span approximately 90\ncountries. A large majority of\nthese institutional deposits\nare within TTS, and of these,\napproximately 80% are from\nclients that use all three TTS\nintegrated services: payments\nand collections, liquidity\nmanagement and working capital\nsolutions. In addition,\napproximately 80% of TTS\ndeposits are from clients that\nhave a longer than 15-year\nrelationship with Citi.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup) and Citi\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries\n(including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated\ninto Citigroup. As of March 31, 2025, non-bank included $92.8\nbillion of long-term debt issued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer and\nother subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup. Certain\nCitigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in\nthis line. (2) Local country and other includes debt issued by\nCiti\u2019s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within\nnon-bank, certain secured financing is also included. (3)\nPredominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by\nBranded Cards receivables.\n\nCiti\u2019s total long-term debt outstanding increased 4% year-over-\nyear, driven by higher benchmark debt issuances by both bank and\nnon-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding\nincreased 3%, largely related to issuances in benchmark debt and\ncustomer-related debt at non-bank entities. As part of its\nliability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to\nconsider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term\ndebt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other\nmeans. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi\u2019s\noverall funding costs. During the first quarter of 2025, Citi\nredeemed or repurchased an aggregate of $14.7 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               66

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nissuances and borrowings from\nthe FHLB and other market\nparticipants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nwith a smaller portion\nexecuted through Citi\u2019s bank\nentities to efficiently fund\nboth (i) secured lending\nactivity and (ii) a portion of\nthe securities inventory held\nin the context of market\nmaking and customer\nactivities. Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $404\nbillion as of March 31, 2025\nincreased 35% year-over-year\nand increased 59% from the\nprior quarter, largely driven\nby additional financing to\nsupport increases in trading-\nrelated assets within Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries. As\nof the quarter ended March 31,\n2025, on an average basis,\nsecured funding was $372\nbillion. The portion of\nsecured funding in the broker-\ndealer subsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity and is primarily\nsecured by high-quality liquid\nsecurities such as U.S.\nTreasury securities, U.S.\nagency securities and foreign\ngovernment debt securities.\nOther \u201cmatched book\u201d activity\nis secured by less liquid\nsecurities, including equity\nsecurities, corporate bonds\nand asset-backed securities,\nthe tenor of which is\ngenerally equal to or longer\nthan the tenor of the\ncorresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $49 billion as of March 31,\n2025 increased 54% year-over-\nyear and 1% sequentially,\ncompared to December 31, 2024.\nThe year-over-year increase\nwas mainly attributable to\nadditional funding raised by\nnon-bank entities to support\nclient activities.

Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfinancing transactions and\nother margin requirements, for\nwhich there are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nIn total, as of March 31,\n2025, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank\nacross all three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$0.2 billion, unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2024. As detailed\nunder \u201cHigh-Quality Liquid\nAssets (HQLA)\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits (ABCP), primarily in\nthe form of asset purchase\nagreements. As of March 31,\n2025, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximately\n$13.6 billion to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits (compared to $14.9\nbillion at December 31, 2024)\n(see Note 21).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate borrowing behavior\nthrough the conduits. A\nreduction in client borrowing\nwould result in a reduced\namount of ABCP issuance.\n                               69                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

This\nwill impact Citi\u2019s CET1 and\nother regulatory capital\nratios. Citi seeks to manage\nits exposure to changes in the\nmarket level of interest\nrates, while limiting the\npotential impact on its AOCI\nand regulatory capital\nposition.\n\nAOCI at risk is managed as\npart of the Company-wide\ninterest rate risk position.\nAOCI at risk considers\npotential changes in AOCI (and\nthe corresponding impact on\nthe CET1 Capital ratio)\nrelative to Citi\u2019s capital\ngeneration capacity.\n\nCiti uses 100 basis point\n(bps) shocks in each scenario\nto reflect its net interest\nincome sensitivity to\nunanticipated changes in\nmarket interest rates,

sensitive (assets\nreprice faster than\nliabilities), resulting in\nhigher net interest income in\nincreasing interest rate\nscenarios. The estimated\nimpact to Citi\u2019s net interest\nincome in a 100 bps upward\nrate shock scenario as of\nMarch 31, 2025 remained\nrelatively stable year-over-\nyear and continued to reflect\nthe IRE sensitivity of\nnon-U.S. dollar currencies. At\nprogressively higher interest\nrate levels, the marginal net\ninterest income benefit is\nlower, as Citi assumes it will\npass on a larger share of rate\nchanges to depositors (i.e.,\nhigher betas), further\nreducing Citi\u2019s IRE\nsensitivity. Currency-specific\ninterest rate changes and\nbalance sheet factors may\ndrive quarter-to-quarter\nvolatility in Citi\u2019s estimated\nIRE for a 100 bps upward rate\nshock.\n\nAll other currencies of $1.5\nbillion as of March 31, 2025\nin the table above includes\nthe impact from the following\ntop five non-U.S. dollar\ncurrencies by absolute size:\napproximately $(0.1) billion\nfrom the euro, $0.2 billion\nfrom the British pound\nsterling and Japanese yen, and\napproximately $0.1 billion\neach from the Chinese yuan and\nIndian rupee. The remaining\nimpact is spread across more\nthan 30 additional currencies.\n\nIn a 100 bps upward rate shock\nscenario, Citi expects that\nthe approximate $1.2 billion\ninitial negative impact to\nAOCI could potentially be\noffset in shareholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio and expected net\ninterest income benefit over a\nperiod of approximately seven\nmonths.\n                               71                               \n                                                                \n  Scenario Analysis                                             \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income and AOCI\nunder eight different interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and all other\ncurrencies in which Citi has\ninvested capital as of March\n31, 2025. The 100 bps and 200\nbps downward rate scenarios\npotentially may be impacted by\nthe low level of interest\nrates in several countries and\nthe assumption that market\ninterest rates, as well as\nrates paid to depositors and\ncharged to borrowers, do not\nfall below zero (i.e., the\n\u201cflooring assumption\u201d). The\ninterest rate scenarios are\nalso impacted by convexity\nrelated to mortgage products\nand deposit pricing.\n                                                                \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         1       2       3       4                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2014       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  2    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes\nthat the rate change will\noccur instantaneously.

The\ninterest rate exposure in the\ntable above assumes no change\nin deposit size or mix from\nthe baseline forecast included\nin the different interest rate\nscenarios presented. As a\nresult, in higher interest\nrate scenarios, customer\nactivity resulting in a shift\nfrom non-interest-bearing and\nlow interest rate deposit\nproducts to higher-yielding\ndeposits would reduce the\nexpected benefit to net\ninterest income. Conversely,\nin lower interest rate\nscenarios, customer activity\nresulting in a shift from\nhigher-yielding deposits to\nnon-interest-bearing and low\ninterest rate deposit products\nwould reduce the expected\ndecrease to net interest\nincome.\n\n(1) The Scenario 1 impact of\n$1,470 million consists of the\nfollowing top five non-U.S.\ndollar currencies as of March\n31, 2025 by absolute size:\napproximately $(0.1) billion\nfrom the euro, $0.2 billion\nfrom the British pound\nsterling and Japanese yen, and\napproximately $0.1 billion\neach from the Chinese yuan and\nIndian rupee. The remaining\nbalance is spread across more\nthan 30 additional currencies.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs presented in the table\nabove, the estimated impact to\nCiti\u2019s net interest income is\nlarger in the short end\ncompared to the long end as\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book has\nrelatively higher interest\nrate exposure to the short end\nof the yield curve. For the\nU.S. dollar, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is larger\nin magnitude than to upward\nrate shocks. This is because\nof the lower benefit to net\ninterest income from Citi\u2019s\ndeposit base at higher rate\nlevels, as well as the\nprepayment effects on mortgage\nloans and mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater in the short\nend compared to the long end.\nThis is because Citi\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio and\npension liabilities are more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                               72                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.5 billion,\nor 1.0%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This\nreduction in the TCE would be\nprimarily driven by\ndepreciation in the value of\nthe euro, Mexican peso and\nIndian rupee.\n\nThis reduction in the TCE does\nnot reflect any mitigating\nactions Citi may take,\nincluding ongoing management\nof its foreign currency\ntranslation exposure. TCE is\nused as a simplified metric to\nmanage CET1 capital ratio\nvolatility. Specifically, as\ncurrency movements change the\nvalue of Citi\u2019s net\ninvestments in foreign\ncurrency-denominated\n\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s RWA\ndenominated in those same\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s CET1\nCapital ratio.

type. The benefit reflects the\nfact that the risks within individual and across risk types are\nnot perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VaR on a\ngiven day will be lower than the sum of the VaRs relating to\neach risk type.

Regulatory VaR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VaR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VaR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VaR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of March 31, 2025, there were no back-\ntesting exceptions observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VaR in the\nlast 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K. Country Risk Country\nrisk is defined as the exposure to potential loss caused by\neconomic, financial or sociopolitical conditions or weaknesses\nin legal systems in a country or jurisdiction that Citi may be\nexposed to through its business activities. Country risk may\nimpair the value of Citi\u2019s franchise within a country or\njurisdiction or adversely affect the ability of Citi to enforce\nthe obligations of its obligors. Citi is exposed to country risk\nthrough its business activities such as lending, payments,\ninvesting and market-making activities, whether cross-border or\nlocally funded, and including activity with corporations,\ngovernments and institutions in a country or jurisdiction. Citi\nmanages country risk through a comprehensive risk framework\nsupported by governance committees and councils that oversee\ncountry risk exposures, including but not limited to relevant\nlimits, concentrations, metrics and frameworks, stress testing,\nsignificant country developments and risk mitigation actions.\nThis is supported by tools and processes designed to facilitate\nthe objective, consistent and ongoing assessments of individual\ncountries and jurisdictions and the risks that may arise from\nCiti\u2019s business activities within them.\n                               80                               \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of March 31, 2025.\n\n(Citi\u2019s combined top 25\nexposures by country and the\nU.S. represent 94% of Citi\u2019s\nexposure to all countries as\nof March 31, 2025.)\n\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry may fluctuate from\nperiod to period due to a\nvariety of factors, including\nclient activity, market flows,\nFX fluctuations and liquidity\nmanagement activities\nundertaken by Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses.\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nbeginning this quarter,\namounts are reflected based on\nthe country of risk of the\nobligor. In prior quarterly\nreports on Form 10-Q and\nannual reports on Form 10-K,\namounts were reflected in the\ntable in the country of the\nCiti booking center in which\neach transaction was booked.\nPrior periods have been\nconformed to reflect this\n\nchange, which provides a more\nmeaningful risk view by\naligning the country\nattribution with the country\nor jurisdiction where the risk\nlies. This change also aligns\nthe disclosure with how risk\nis viewed, measured and\nmanaged by Citi.\n\nThe country of risk will\ngenerally be the same as the\ncountry of incorporation of\nthe obligor, except in certain\nsituations, such as where the\nsource of repayment is\nconcentrated in a different\ncountry or jurisdiction or\nwhere the obligor is\nguaranteed by a parent entity\nincorporated in a different\ncountry or jurisdiction (e.g.,\na Swiss-incorporated\nsubsidiary that is guaranteed\nby a Chinese-incorporated\nparent would be reflected as\nChina risk).\n\nInvestment securities and\ntrading account assets are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.\n

When\nthe Russian ruble depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar, the\nU.S. dollar equivalent value\nof Citigroup\u2019s investment in\nAO Citibank also declines.\nThis change in value is offset\nby the change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative).

In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi has incurred\napproximately $82 million to\ndate in charges, largely from\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges. Citi expects\nto incur an additional\napproximate $21 million in\nestimated charges (in All\nOther , excluding the impact\nfrom any portfolio sales).

Examples of factors\nthat may result in\ndeconsolidation of AO Citibank\ninclude voluntary or forced\nsale of ownership or loss of\ncontrol due to actions of\nrelevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank, Citi would be\nrequired to (i) write off the\nnet investment of less than\n$0.1 billion (unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2024), (ii)\nrecognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\n(unchanged from December 31,\n2024) through earnings and\n(iii) recognize a loss of $1.1\nbillion (an increase of $0.2\nbillion from December 31,\n2024) on intercompany\nliabilities owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve. The $1.6 billion CTA\nwrite-off through earnings\nunder either event is expected\nto be largely equity neutral,\nsince the reversal of the CTA\nloss out of AOCI would improve\nCiti\u2019s total AOCI .\n\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u2014Citi as Paying\nAgent for Russia-related\nClients,\u201d \u201c\u2014Reputational\nRisks\u201d and \u201c\u2014Board of\nDirectors\u2019 Role in Overseeing\nRelated Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2024\nForm 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector.

As of March 31,\n2025, the official ARS\nexchange rate was 1,074, which\ndevalued by 4% against the USD\nduring the first quarter of\n2025.\n\nThe Central Bank of Argentina\n(BCRA) has generally\nmaintained certain capital and\ncurrency controls that have\nbroadly restricted Citi\u2019s\nability to access USD in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nOn April 11, 2025, the\ngovernment of Argentina\nexecuted an extended funding\nfacility with the\nInternational Monetary Fund,\npursuant to which the\ngovernment announced certain\nmeasures related to its\nhistorical capital and\ncurrency controls.\nSpecifically, the government\nannounced that it will allow\nthe official exchange rate to\nfluctuate between 1,000 and\n1,400 ARS per USD, that\nexchange restrictions are\nremoved for individuals\n(though are still applicable\nto local institutions) and\nthat 2025 earnings may be\nremitted in 2026, through\nordinary dividends.\nAdditionally, the BCRA has\nannounced that it will issue a\nnew series of certain USD-\ndenominated bonds (BOPREALs),\nsimilar to the prior year,\nwhich provides a mechanism to\nremit dividends up to a\ncertain amount in 2025 through\nthe purchase and subsequent\nsale of the bonds and\nremittance of the bond\nproceeds.\n\nNonetheless, the historical\nand ongoing capital and\ncurrency controls have\nresulted in indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms that some\nArgentine entities may use to\nobtain USD, often at rates\nthat are significantly higher\nthan Argentina\u2019s official\nexchange rate. If the official\nexchange rate converges with\nthe approximate rate implied\nby the indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms, Citi\ncould incur additional\ntranslation losses on its net\ninvestment in Argentina.\n\nOf the $1.6 billion net\ninvestment in Argentina as of\nMarch 31, 2025, Citi\u2019s net ARS\nexposure was approximately\n$1.1 billion (unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2024).\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, Citi\nhedged approximately $0.2\nbillion of its ARS exposure\nthrough offshore hedges, and\nCiti was unable to hedge its\nremaining exposure, given\nilliquidity in the offshore\nderivatives market.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s emerging markets risks,\nincluding those related to its\nArgentina exposures, see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d\nin Citi\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K.\n                               84                               \nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT\nESTIMATES\n\nThis section contains a\nsummary of Citi\u2019s most\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2024 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A portion of\nthese assets and liabilities\nis reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet as Trading account\nassets , Available-for-sale\nsecurities and Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\ndrivers to the valuation of an\ninstrument and the degree of\nilliquidity and subsequent\nlack of observability in\ncertain markets. The fair\nvalue of these instruments is\nreported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nwith the changes in fair value\nrecognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses, and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2024 Form\n10-K.\n                               85                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below presents\nCiti\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\ntotal ACL as of March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, as well\nas builds and releases during\n2025.

These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\n\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover a R&S timeframe.

The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent includes risks not\nfully captured in the\nquantitative component. Both\nthe quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                               86                               \nQuantitative Component Citi\nestimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions. For its consumer\nand corporate portfolios,\nCiti\u2019s expected credit losses\nare determined primarily by\nutilizing models that consider\nthe borrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables, including housing\nprices, unemployment rate and\nreal GDP, and cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry,\nproduct and business segments.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on portfolio\ncharacteristics, including\nloan delinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well\nas other credit trends.\nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes\nrisks that are not fully\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent. These may include\nbut are not limited to\nportfolio characteristics,\nidiosyncratic events, factors\nnot within historical loss\ndata or the economic forecast,\nuncertainty in the credit\nenvironment and other factors\nas required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The primary examples of\nthese are the following: \u2022\nTransfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S.,\ndriven by certain safety and\nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law \u2022 Potential\nimpacts on vulnerable\nindustries and regions due to\nemerging macroeconomic risks\nand uncertainties, including\nthose related to a potential\nglobal recession, inflation,\ninterest rates and commodity\nprices. \u2022 Risk associated with\nconsumer payment behavior\ngiven the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment As of the first\nquarter of 2025, Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the\nACL decreased quarter-over-\nquarter. The decrease was\nprimarily driven by a\nreduction in qualitative\nreserves associated with\nconsumer payment behavior\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironments, which are now\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, partially offset by\na build for specific risks and\nuncertainties impacting\nvulnerable industries and\nregions, as well as an\nincrease in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S. for safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law.\nMacroeconomic Variables As\nfurther discussed below, Citi\nconsiders various global\nmacroeconomic variables for\nthe base, upside and downside\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe quantitative component of\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP\n\ngrowth rate represent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL. The\ntables below present Citi\u2019s\nforecasted quarterly average\nU.S. unemployment rate and\nyear-over-year U.S. real GDP\ngrowth rate used in\ndetermining the base\nmacroeconomic forecast for\nCiti\u2019s ACL at each quarterly\nreporting period from the\nfirst quarter of 2024 to the\nfirst quarter of 2025:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            2Q25       4Q25       2Q26       8-quart\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.1  %     4.0  %     4.0  %         4.0  %  \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.1        4.1        3.9            4.1     \n  at 2Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.4        4.3        3.9            4.2     \n  at 3Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.3        4.3        4.1            4.2     \n  at 4Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.2        4.3        4.3            4.3     \n  at 1Q25                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking eight\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. real GDP                  2025       2026       2027     \n  Citi forecast                   1.8  %     2.0  %     2.0  %  \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.8        2.0        2.0     \n  at 2Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.8        2.0        2.0     \n  at 3Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.2        2.1        2.2     \n  at 4Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.0        1.9        2.0     \n  at 1Q25                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level. Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof the first quarter of 2025,\nU.S. real GDP growth is\nexpected to slow during 2025,\nwhile the unemployment rate is\nexpected to increase in 2025\nbut begin to decline in 2026.\nScenario Weighting Citi\u2019s ACL\nis estimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other sources of\nmacroeconomic uncertainties\nand risks. Citi evaluates\nscenario weights on a\nquarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario. For example,\ncompared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nreflects a recession,\nincluding an elevated average\nU.S. unemployment rate of 6.7%\nover the eight-quarter R&S\nperiod, with a peak difference\nof 3.2% in the third quarter\nof 2026. To further illustrate\nthe impact of the adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions in\nthe downside scenario, the\nweighted-average U.S.\nunemployment rate that\nconsiders all three\nprobability-weighted scenarios\nis 5.1%. The downside scenario\nalso reflects a year-over-year\nU.S. real GDP contraction in\n2025 of 0.8%, with a peak\nquarter-over-quarter\ndifference to the base\nscenario of 1.2%.\n                               87                               \nCiti\u2019s ACL is sensitive to the\nvarious macroeconomic\nscenarios that drive the\nquantitative component of\nexpected credit losses, due to\nchanges in the length and\nseverity of forecasted\neconomic variables or events\nin the respective scenarios.\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe weighted scenario\nassumptions. To demonstrate\nthis sensitivity, if Citi\napplied 100% weight to the\ndownside scenario as of March\n31, 2025 to reflect the most\nsevere economic deterioration\nforecast in the macroeconomic\nscenarios, there would have\nbeen a hypothetical\nincremental increase in the\nACL of approximately $5.3\nbillion related to lending\nexposures, except for loans\nindividually evaluated for\ncredit losses and other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost.\n\nThis analysis does not\nincorporate any impacts or\nchanges to the qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL. These\nfactors could change the\noutcome of the sensitivity\nanalysis based on historical\nexperience and current\nconditions at the time of the\nassessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of March 31,\n2025.\n\n1Q25 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for\nthe first quarter of 2025 was\n$22.8 billion, an increase of\n$0.6 billion from December 31,\n2024. The net build of $0.2\nbillion in the quarter was\ndriven by uncertainty and\ndeterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook and\nchanges in portfolio\ncomposition in USPB ,\npartially offset by lower end-\nof-period U.S. cards loan\nbalances in USPB . Citi\nbelieves its analysis of the\nACL reflects the forward view\nof the economic environment as\nof March 31, 2025. See Note 15\nfor additional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nprimarily driven by U.S. cards\n(Branded Cards and Retail\nServices) in USPB . Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACLL net\nrelease was ($0.1) billion in\nthe first quarter of 2025,\nprimarily driven by lower\ncards balances, offset by\nchanges in portfolio\ncomposition in USPB , and\nuncertainty and deterioration\nin the macroeconomic outlook\nin USPB , Wealth and All Other\n. This resulted in a March 31,\n2025 ACLL balance of $16.0\nbillion, or 4.14% of total\nfunded consumer loans.\n\nFor U.S. cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans increased to\n8.23% at March 31, 2025,\ndriven by changes in portfolio\ncomposition and uncertainty\nand deterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook,\ncompared to 7.93% at December\n31, 2024. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to total\nfunded loans was 1.17% at\nMarch 31, 2025, compared to\n1.11% at December 31, 2024.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nbuild of $0.2 billion in the\nfirst quarter of 2025, largely\ndriven by uncertainty and\n\ndeterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook. This\nresulted in a March 31, 2025\nACLL balance of $2.7 billion,\nor 0.89% of total funded\ncorporate loans.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC build of\n$0.1 billion in the first\nquarter of 2025, largely\ndriven by uncertainty and\ndeterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook. The\nACLUC reserve balance,\nincluded in Other liabilities\n, was $1.7 billion at March\n31, 2025.\n                                                                \n  ACL on Other Financial Assets                                 \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACL build of less\nthan $0.1 billion on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost for the first\nquarter of 2025, primarily\ndriven by an increase in\ntransfer risk associated with\nunremittable corporate\ndividends outside the U.S.\nbeing held on behalf of\nclients, driven by safety and\nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law. Including\nFX/Other, the ACL reserve\nbalance of $2.3 billion\nincreased $0.3 billion from\nDecember 31, 2024.

The\nquarter-over-quarter decrease\nwas primarily from a carry-\nforward reduction. Of Citi\u2019s\n$29.6 billion of net DTAs,\n$13.8 billion (compared to\n$12.8 billion at December 31,\n2024) was deducted in\ncalculating Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital, and the remaining\n$15.8 billion was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder the Basel III rules. The\n$13.8 billion of DTAs deducted\nfrom regulatory capital was\ncomposed of $11.5 billion\nrelated to tax carry-forwards,\nwith $4.3 billion of temporary\ndifferences in excess of the\n10%/15% regulatory\nlimitations, reduced by $2.0\nbillion of deferred tax\nliabilities, primarily\nassociated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible\nassets that were separately\ndeducted from capital. DTA\nRealizability Citi believes\nthat the net DTAs of $29.6\nbillion at March 31, 2025 are\nmore-likely-than-not to be\nrealized, based on\nmanagement\u2019s expectations of\nfuture taxable income\ngeneration in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\nconsideration of available tax\nplanning strategies (as\ndefined in ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes ).\n                               89                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nMarch 31, 2025. Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO\nhave concluded that at that\ndate Citigroup\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were\neffective.\n\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION\n219 OF THE IRAN THREAT\nREDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN\nRIGHTS ACT\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the\nIran Threat Reduction and\nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012\n(Section 219), which added\nSection 13(r) to the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, Citi is\nrequired to disclose in its\nannual or quarterly reports,\nas applicable, whether it or\nany of its affiliates\nknowingly engaged in certain\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings relating to Iran or\nwith certain individuals or\nentities that are the subject\nof sanctions under U.S. law.\nDisclosure may be required\neven where the activities,\ntransactions or dealings were\nconducted in compliance with\napplicable law. To the extent\nthat transactions or dealings\nfor its clients are permitted\nby U.S. law, Citi may continue\nto engage in such activities.\n\nDuring the first quarter of\n2025, Citigroup identified one\ntransaction that was\nreportable pursuant to Section\n219.\n\nOn January 14, 2025, Citibank,\nN.A., New York Branch\nparticipated in a transaction\nthat indirectly involved the\nForeign Trade Bank of the\nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic\nof Korea (DPRK) when it\nprocessed a funds transfer\nfrom an international\norganization to the account of\nthe DPRK\u2019s Permanent Mission\nat the international\norganization\u2019s federal credit\nunion. The total value of the\npayment was USD 1,000,000.00\nand its purpose was to fund\nthe international\norganization\u2019s humanitarian\nactivities in the DPRK and the\noperations of the DPRK\nmission. This transaction was\nmade pursuant to a license\nissued by the U.S. Department\nof the Treasury\u2019s Office of\nForeign Assets Control on\nNovember 23, 2024, which\nexpires on November 30, 2025.\nCiti realized nominal fees for\nthe processing of the payment.\n                               90                               \n                                                                \n  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                    \n                                                                \nCertain statements in this\nForm 10-Q, including but not\nlimited to statements included\nwithin Management\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of\nOperations, are \u201cforward-\nlooking statements\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995. In addition,\nCitigroup may make forward-\nlooking statements in its\nother documents filed or\nfurnished with the SEC, and\nits management may make\nforward-looking statements\norally to analysts, investors,\nrepresentatives of the media\nand others.\n\nGenerally, forward-looking\nstatements are not based on\nhistorical facts but instead\nrepresent Citigroup\u2019s and its\nmanagement\u2019s beliefs regarding\nfuture events.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND\nACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements as of March 31, 2025 and for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 include the accounts of\nCitigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In the opinion\nof management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring\nadjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial\nStatements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and related notes included within\nCitigroup\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 (2024 Form 10-K). Certain financial\ninformation that is usually included in annual financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP), but is not required for interim\nreporting purposes, has been condensed or omitted. Management\nmust make estimates and assumptions that affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the related footnote disclosures. While\nmanagement uses its best judgment, actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates. As noted above, the Notes to these\nConsolidated Financial Statements are unaudited. Throughout\nthese Notes, \u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe Company\u201d refer to\nCitigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates have been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements and notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation. Cash equivalents are defined as\nthose amounts included in Cash and due from banks and\npredominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from risk\nmanagement activities are classified in the same category as the\nrelated assets and liabilities. Amounts included in Cash and due\nfrom banks and Deposits with banks approximate fair value.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements\nto Reportable Segment Disclosures In November 2023, the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , intended\nto improve reportable segments disclosure requirements primarily\nthrough enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.\nThe ASU includes a requirement to disclose significant segment\nexpenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure\nof segment profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM,\nan explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of\nsegment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and\ndeciding how to allocate resources, and all segments\u2019 profit or\nloss and assets disclosures currently required annually by Topic\n280 along with those introduced by the ASU to be reported on an\ninterim basis. The amendments also clarified that public\nentities are not precluded from reporting additional measures of\na segment\u2019s profit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM.\nCiti adopted the ASU on a retrospective basis for its annual\nperiod ending December 31, 2024 and the ASU for the interim\nperiod beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 3 for further\ndetails. Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness\nof income tax disclosures. This guidance requires that public\nbusiness entities disclose on an annual basis a tabular rate\nreconciliation in eight specific categories disaggregated by\nnature and for foreign tax effects by each jurisdiction that\nmeets a 5% of pretax income multiplied by the applicable\nstatutory tax rate or greater threshold annually. The eight\ncategories include state and local income taxes, net of federal\nincome tax effect; foreign tax effects; enactment of new tax\nlaws; enactment of new tax credits; effect of cross-border tax\nlaws; valuation allowances; nontaxable items and nondeductible\nitems; and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. Additional\ndisclosures include qualitative description of the state and\nlocal jurisdictions that contribute to the majority (greater\nthan 50%) of the effect of the state and local income tax\ncategory and explanation of the nature and effect of changes in\nindividual reconciling items. The guidance also requires\nentities annually to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds\nreceived) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and\nby jurisdiction identified based on the same 5% quantitative\nthreshold.\n                              104                               \nThe standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. The transition method is prospective with the\nretrospective method permitted. Citi plans to adopt the ASU for\nthe year ending December 31, 2025. See Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of 2024 accounting changes. FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses In November 2024,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement\u2014Reporting\nComprehensive Income\u2014Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n(Subtopic 220-40) , to improve the disclosures of expenses by\nrequiring public business entities to provide further\ndisaggregation of relevant expense captions (i.e., employee\ncompensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization) in a\nseparate note to the financial statements, a qualitative\ndescription of the amounts remaining in relevant expense\ncaptions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively,\nand the total amount of selling expenses and, in an annual\nreporting period, an entity\u2019s definition of selling expenses.\nThe transition method is prospective with the retrospective\nmethod permitted, and the ASU will be effective for Citi for its\nannual period ending December 31, 2027 and interim periods for\nthe interim period beginning January 1, 2028. Citi is currently\nevaluating the impact on its disclosures.\n                              105                               \n2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,\nSIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS AND\nOTHER BUSINESS EXITS\n\nSummary of Discontinued\nOperations Citi\u2019s results from\nDiscontinued operations\nconsisted of residual\nactivities related to the\nsales of the Egg Banking plc\ncredit card business in 2011\nand the German retail banking\nbusiness in 2008. All\nDiscontinued operations\nresults are recorded within\nAll Other . Citi\u2019s Income\n(loss) from discontinued\noperations, net of taxes was\n$( 1) million and $( 1)\nmillion for the three months\nended March 31, 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively. Cash flows from\nDiscontinued operations were\nnot material for the periods\npresented. Significant\nDisposals As of March 31,\n2025, Citi had closed the\nsales of nineconsumer banking\nbusinesses within All Other\n\u2014Legacy Franchises: Australia\nclosed in the second quarter\nof 2022, the Philippines\nclosed in the third quarter of\n2022, Bahrain, Malaysia and\nThailand closed in the fourth\nquarter of 2022, India and\nVietnam closed in the first\nquarter of 2023, Taiwan closed\nin the third quarter of 2023\nand Indonesia closed in the\nfourth quarter of 2023.\nFive(Australia, the\nPhilippines, Thailand, India\nand Taiwan) were identified as\nsignificant disposals. As of\nMarch 31, 2025, there were no\nremaining assets or\nliabilities included on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nrelated to the significant\ndisposals. Citi did not have\nany other significant\ndisposals as of March 31,\n2025. As of May 8, 2025, Citi\nhad not entered into sale\nagreements for the remaining\nAll Other \u2014Legacy Franchises\nbusinesses to be sold,\nspecifically the Poland\nconsumer banking business and\nthe Mexico Consumer/SBMM\n(Banamex) businesses. For a\ndescription of the Company\u2019s\nsignificant disposal\ntransactions in prior periods\nand financial impact, see Note\n2 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2024 Form 10-K.\n                              106                               \n                                                                \n  3. OPERATING SEGMENTS                                         \n                                                                \nThe operating segments and\nreporting units reflect how\nthe CEO, who is the chief\noperating decision maker\n(CODM), manages the Company,\nincluding allocating resources\nand measuring performance.\nCiti is organized into\nfivereportable operating\nsegments: Services , Markets ,\nBanking , Wealth and U.S.\nPersonal Banking (USPB) , with\nthe remaining operations\nrecorded in All Other , which\nincludes activities not\nassigned to a specific\nreportable operating segment,\nas well as discontinued\noperations. See operating\nsegment details in Note 3 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2024 Form\n10-K. Revenues and expenses\ndirectly associated with each\nrespective business segment or\ncomponent are included in\ndetermining respective\noperating results. Other\nrevenues and expenses that are\nattributable to a particular\nbusiness segment or component\nare generally allocated from\nAll Other based on respective\nnet revenues, non-interest\nexpenses or other relevant\nmeasures. Revenues and\nexpenses from transactions\nwith other operating segments\nor components are treated as\ntransactions with external\nparties for purposes of\nsegment disclosures, while\nfunding charges paid by\noperating segments and funding\ncredits received by Corporate\nTreasury within All Other are\nincluded in net interest\nincome. The Company includes\nintersegment eliminations\nwithin All Other to reconcile\nthe operating segment results\nto Citi\u2019s consolidated\nresults. The accounting\npolicies of these reportable\noperating segments are the\nsame as those disclosed in\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2024 Form 10-K.\n                              107                               \nThe following tables present certain information regarding the\nCompany\u2019s continuing operations by reportable operating segments\nand All Other on a managed basis that excludes divestiture-\nrelated impacts. The CODM uses Income (loss) from continuing\noperations as the performance measure, to evaluate the results\nof each reportable operating segment by comparing to and\nmonitoring against budget and prior-year results. This\ninformation is used to allocate resources to each of the\nsegments and to make operational decisions when managing the\nCompany, such as whether to reinvest profits or to return\ncapital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at Fair Value\nNon-marketable equity securities are required to be measured at\nfair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings\nunless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the\ninvestment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan\nBank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried\nat cost. The election to measure a non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement alternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus\nchanges resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair\nvalue on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may\ndiffer from the observed transaction price due to a number of\nfactors, including marketability adjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for\nthe identical investment held by Citi. Equity securities under\nthe measurement alternative, which are composed of private\nequity investments, are also assessed for impairment. On a\nquarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each\nequity security under the measurement alternative is impaired.\nFor details on impairment indicators that are considered, see\nNote 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2024\nForm 10-K. When the qualitative assessment indicates that the\nequity security is impaired, its fair value is determined. If\nthe fair value of the investment is less than its carrying\nvalue, the investment is written down to fair value through\nearnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative at\nMarch 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024 :\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                    March 31, 2025               2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value          $           1,541    $         1,574  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized\nin earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable\nequity securities measured\nusing the measurement\nalternative:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                        Three Months Ended             \n  Measurement                             March 31,             \n  alternative(1):                              2025       2024  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impairment losses        $                     52    $    16  \n  Downward changes for                            \u2014          \u2014  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                              9         49  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 23 for additional\ninformation on these\nnonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                        March 31, 2025  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                          469  \n  Downward changes for                                      39  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                     1,039  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

Corporate loans are\nconsidered past due when principal or interest is contractually\ndue but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90\ndays or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest and/or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(4) The Total loans column includes loans at fair value, which\nare not included in the various delinquency columns and,\ntherefore, the

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial\nDifficulty Citi seeks to modify certain corporate loans to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty to reduce Citi\u2019s\nexposure to loss,

Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist credit card\nborrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering\nlong-term loan modification programs. These modifications\ngenerally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card,\nplacing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60\nmonths and canceling the customer\u2019s available line of credit.\nCiti also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working\nwith third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure\ncustomers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In certain situations, Citi\nmay forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower\npays a required amount. Residential Mortgages Citi utilizes a\nthird-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential\nmortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks\nto assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate\nreductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term\nextensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in\nforbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the\nend of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently\nmodifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi\nenters into a trial modification with the borrower, generally a\nthree-monthperiod during which the borrower makes monthly\npayments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon\nsuccessful completion of the trial period, and the borrower\u2019s\nformal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower\nenter into a permanent modification.

The decrease was driven by a\nreduction in U.S. cards loan balances, primarily offset by a\nbuild due to changes in portfolio composition, uncertainty and\ndeterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.

maximum exposure to loss is included in\nthe text that follows this table.\n(2) Included on Citigroup\u2019s March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the\nCompany has any variable interest or continuing involvement\nconsidered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 82.6billion and $\n45.5billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 875million and $\n824million in maximum exposure to loss as of March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, respectively.\n                              157                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain investment funds\nfor which the Company provides investment management services\nand personal estate trusts for which the Company provides\nadministrative, trustee and/or investment management services; \u2022\ncertain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the\nCompany provides credit facilities. The Company has no decision-\nmaking power and does not consolidate these funds, some of which\nmay meet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure\nto loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions\nwas $ 8.4billion and $ 8.1billion, respectively (see Note 14 and\nNote 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2024\nForm 10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which\nthe Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments\nare made on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage-\nand asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and\n23); \u2022 certain representations and warranties exposures in\nCitigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the\noriginal mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022\nVIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with\nthe Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. Consolidated VIEs The Company\nengages in on-balance sheet securitizations, which are\nsecuritizations that do not qualify for sales treatment; thus,\nthe assets remain on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any\nproceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities. In\ngeneral, the third-party investors in the obligations of\nconsolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to the assets of the\nrespective VIEs and do not have such recourse to the Company,\nexcept where Citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or\nis the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving\nthe VIE. Thus, Citigroup\u2019s maximum legal exposure to loss\nrelated to consolidated VIEs is significantly less than the\ncarrying value of the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding\nthird-party financing. Intercompany assets and liabilities are\nexcluded from Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets\nare restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral. The\ncash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay\ndown the associated liabilities, which are non-recourse to\nCiti\u2019s general assets. The asset balances for consolidated VIEs\nrepresent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the\nCompany. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or\nthe current fair value of the assets depending on the\nclassification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the\nassociated accounting model ascribed to that classification. The\nasset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has\nsignificant involvement represent the most current information\navailable to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances\nrepresent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments,\nunless fair value information is readily available to the\nCompany. The maximum funded exposure represents the balance\nsheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in the VIE. It\nreflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE,\nadjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments\nreceived. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases\nor declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized\nin earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions\nrepresents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including\nliquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the\nnotional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a\nvariable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has\nentered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that\nare not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest\nrate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the\npurchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or\ntotal return swap where the Company pays the total return on\ncertain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements\nare not included in the maximum exposure amounts.\n                              158                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs, which are included on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The assets include those assets that can only be\nused to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs and are in\nexcess of those obligations. In addition, the assets include\nthird-party assets of consolidated VIEs only and exclude\nintercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The\nliabilities include third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs\nonly and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in\nconsolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts where\ncreditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to the\ngeneral credit of Citigroup.\n

The\nprincipal securitized and the\nproceeds from new\nsecuritizations for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025\nwere $ 0.3billion and $\n0.2billion, respectively. The\ngains recognized on the\nsecuritization of consumer\nloans were $ 0.2million for\nthe three months ended March\n31, 2025. Mortgage Servicing\nRights (MSRs) In connection\nwith the securitization of\nmortgage loans, Citi\u2019s U.S.\nconsumer mortgage business\ngenerally retains the\nservicing rights, which\nentitle the Company to a\nfuture stream of cash flows\nbased on the outstanding\nprincipal balances of the\nloans and the contractual\nservicing fee. Failure to\nservice the loans in\naccordance with contractual\nrequirements may lead to a\ntermination of the servicing\nrights and the loss of future\nservicing fees. These\ntransactions create intangible\nassets referred to as MSRs,\nwhich are recorded at fair\nvalue on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet (see Note 23 for\nthe valuation of MSRs). The\nMSRs correspond to principal\nloan balances of $ 57billion\nand $ 52billion as of March\n31, 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively.

Re-securitizations The\nCompany engages in re-securitization transactions backed by\neither residential or commercial mortgages in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private\nlabel) securities to re-securitization entities, nor did Citi\nhold retained interests in such securitizations, during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. As of March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, Citi held noretained interests in private\nlabel re-securitization transactions structured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed\nmortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the three months\nended March 31, 2025, Citi transferred agency securities with a\nfair value of approximately $ 7.0billion to re-securitization\nentities, compared to approximately $ 4.4billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024.\n\nAs of March 31, 2025, the fair value of Citi-retained interests\nin agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi\ntotaled approximately $ 2.5billion (including $ 1.3billion\nrelated to re-securitization transactions executed in 2025),\ncompared to $ 1.6billion as of December 31, 2024 (including $\n977million related to re-securitization transactions executed in\n2024), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The\noriginal fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained interest as of March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024 were approximately $ 77.6billion and $\n76.8billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31,\n2024, the Company did not consolidate any private label or\nagency re-securitization entities. Citi-Administered Asset-\nBacked Commercial Paper Conduits At March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had\napproximately $ 18.3billion and $ 21.3billion of purchased\nassets outstanding, and unfunded commitments with clients of\napproximately $ 17.1billion and $ 16.7billion, respectively. At\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the weighted-average\nremaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the\nconduits were approximately 91and 82days, respectively. The\nconduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that\nequal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit\u2019s assets with a minimum\nof $ 200million to $ 350million. The letters of credit provided\nby the Company to the conduits total approximately $ 1.9billion\nand $ 2.1billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. In the event that defaulted assets exceed the\ntransaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any\nlosses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and\nthen to the commercial paper investors. At March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, the Company owned $ 4.7billion and $\n6.4billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits. The Company\u2019s investments were not driven\nby market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any\nagreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the\nconduits. Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts\nThe Company provides credit enhancement for certain non-customer\ntrusts. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, $ 0.7billion\nand $ 0.4billion, respectively, of the municipal bonds owned by\nnon-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee\nprovided by the Company. The Company provides other liquidity\nagreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal\ninvestment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and\nmunicipality-related issuers that totaled $ 0.5billion and $\n0.5billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit\nare offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out\nprovisions.\n                              162                               \nAsset-Based Financing\n\nThe primary types of Citi\u2019s asset-based financings, total assets\nof the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to\nrealize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to\ndefault with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.\n                                                                \n                 March                    Decemb\u2026               \n                   31,                        31,               \n                  2025                       2024               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                         Maxim\u2026                     Maxim\u2026  \n  milli\u2026       Totalu\u2026       tounc\u2026       Totalu\u2026       tounc\u2026  \n  of            assets         VIEs        assets         VIEs  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Type                                                          \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  other     $   63,412    $  10,524    $   61,322    $   9,693  \n  real                                                          \n  estate                                                        \n  Corpo\u2026        50,809       25,220        45,542       21,009  \n  loans                                                         \n  Other                                                         \n  (incl\u2026                                                        \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  funds,       184,528       34,009       153,687       37,567  \n  airli\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  shipp\u2026                                                        \n  Total     $  298,749    $  69,753    $  260,551    $  68,269  \n                                                                \n                              163                               \n                                                                \n  22.

All derivatives are\nrecorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note\n24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2024 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining to Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table\nbelow. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from\nwhich contractual payments are derived and do not represent a\ncomplete measure of Citi\u2019s exposure to derivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure arises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market\nvaluation adjustments that may be required on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts presented below do not reflect the\nnetting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and\noffsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed\nposition with a different counterparty, $200 million in\nderivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting\npositions may result in de minimis overall market risk. In\naddition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate\nfrom period to period in the normal course of business based on\nCiti\u2019s market share, levels of client activity and other\nfactors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n                                                                \n               Hedgi\u2026                                           \n

a\n\u201creference asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk, and as a market-maker to facilitate client\ntransactions.\n                              164                               \nThe following tables present the gross and net fair values of\nthe Company\u2019s derivative transactions and the related offsetting\namounts as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Gross\npositive fair values are offset against gross negative fair\nvalues by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in\nrespect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given\ncounterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in\nthe offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security\ncollateral. In addition, the following tables reflect rule\nchanges adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow\nentities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as settlement of the related derivative\nfair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to\npresenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are\nsubject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables\nalso present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the\nCompany\u2019s balance sheet presentation, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians,\nbut which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an\nevent of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              165                               \nDerivative Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables\n

any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of\na specified event related to the credit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are defined by the existing derivative\ncontracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the\nCompany and its affiliates. The fair value (excluding CVA) of\nall derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net liability position at March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024 was $ 13billion and $ 15billion,\nrespectively. The Company posted $ 11billion and $ 13billion as\ncollateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as\nof March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch\nby all threemajor rating agencies as of March 31, 2025, the\nCompany could be required to post an additional $ 0.2billion as\neither collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could be required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians collateral previously received from\nexisting derivative counterparties in an amount of approximately\n$ 9million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in\naggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of\napproximately $ 0.2billion. Derivatives Accompanied by Financial\nAsset Transfers For transfers of financial assets accounted for\nas a sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained\nsubstantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred\nasset through a total return swap executed with the same\ncounterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still\noutstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash\nproceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $\n6.0billion and $ 6.2billion as of March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, respectively. At March 31, 2025, the fair value of\nthese previously derecognized assets was $ 5.5billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return swaps as of March 31, 2025 was $\n106.1million recorded as gross derivative assets and $\n182.3million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2024, the fair value of these previously\nderecognized assets was $ 5.8billion, and the fair value of the\ntotal return swaps was $ 179million recorded as gross derivative\nassets and $ 29million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.\nThe balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of counterparty and cash collateral\nnetting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the\ntabular disclosures in this Note.\n                              173                               \n                                                                \n              This page intentionally left blank.               \n                                                                \n                              174                               \n23. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For\nadditional information\nregarding fair value\nmeasurement at Citi, see Note\n26 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2024 Form 10-K. Fair Value\nHierarchy Principles ASC\n820-10 specifies a hierarchy\nof inputs based on whether the\ninputs are observable or\nunobservable. Observable\ninputs are developed using\nmarket data and reflect market\nparticipant assumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nvalue drivers are observable\nin the market. \u2022 Level 3:\nValuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which\none or more significant inputs\nor significant value drivers\nare unobservable . As required\nunder the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data-driven criteria to\ndetermine whether an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022\nThe determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based on the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nThe table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments\n(CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) applied to the\nfair value of derivative instruments (recorded in Trading\naccount assets and Trading account liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet) at March 31,

The\nfollowing were the significant\nLevel 3 transfers for the\nperiod from December 31, 2023\nto March 31, 2024:\n\nDuring the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, transfers of\nLong-term debt were $\n1.4billion from Level 2 to\nLevel 3. Of the $ 1.4billion\ntransfer, approximately $\n0.9billion related to interest\nrate option volatility inputs\nbecoming unobservable and/or\nsignificant relative to their\noverall valuation, and $\n0.4billion related to equity\nand credit derivative inputs\n(in addition to other\nvolatility inputs, e.g.,\ninterest rate volatility\ninputs) becoming unobservable\nand/or significant to their\noverall valuation. In other\ninstances, market changes have\nresulted in some inputs\nbecoming more observable, and\nsome unobservable inputs\nbecoming less significant to\nthe overall valuation of the\ninstruments (e.g., when an\noption becomes deep-in or\ndeep-out of the money). This\nhas primarily resulted in $\n0.8billion of certain\nstructured long-term debt\nproducts being transferred\nfrom Level 3 to Level 2 during\nthe three months ended March\n31, 2024.\n                              184                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements The following tables present the valuation\ntechniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the\nmost significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements.

The election is made upon the initial\nrecognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability\nor firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration\nevents occur. The fair value election\n\nmay not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The\nchanges in fair value are recorded in current earnings.\nMovements in DVA are reported as a component of AOCI . The\nCompany has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage\nservicing rights (MSRs). See Note 21 for additional details on\nCiti\u2019s MSRs.

See Notes 19 and 23.\n                              191                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 19\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a gain\nof $ 1,000million and a loss of $( 750) million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Changes in\nfair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit\nrisk were estimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current\ncredit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant\nvaluation technique used to value each liability as described\nabove. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial\nLiabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain\nUncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the\nfair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income\nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nborrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-\nterm borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the\nU.S., the U.K. and Japan. In each case, the election was made\nbecause the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio\nbasis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are\naccounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair\nvalue for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . The related interest income and\ninterest expense are measured based on the contractual rates\nspecified in the transactions and are reported as Interest\nincome and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Loans and Other Credit Products Citigroup has also\nelected the fair value option for certain other originated and\npurchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such\nas guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s\nlending and trading businesses. Significant groups of\ntransactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are\nexpected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or\ntransactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative\ninstruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total\nreturn swaps where the Company pays the total return on the\nunderlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases\nwhere hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending\ntransactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                                           Decemb\u2026              \n                   March                       31,              \n                31, 2025                      2024              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026        Trading       Loans       Trading       Loans  \n  of              assets                    assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $     5,055    $  8,165    $    5,025    $  8,040  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess             173         -76           137         -55  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                \u2014           1             \u2014           2  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                \u2014           \u2014             \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 207million and $\n280million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\n                              192                               \nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest income is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nincome on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended March 31, 2025\nand 2024 due to instrument-specific credit risk were a gain of $\n24million and a loss of $( 16) million, respectively. Changes in\nfair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated\nbased on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and\nrecovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of\nits commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment\nis bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract and reports the contract within\nTrading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades\nunallocated precious metals investments and executes forward\npurchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading\ncounterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals\ninvestment, Citi\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid\nand Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious\nmetal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. Certain\nMortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS) Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option for certain purchased and originated prime\nfixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans\nHFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are\neconomically hedged with derivative instruments.

                                                 \n(1) The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be approximately $ 80billion\nand $ 124billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants. As such, any losses\nincurred and the carrying amounts of Citi\u2019s contingent\nobligations related to merchant processing activities were\nimmaterial. See \u201cCard Merchant Processing\u201d below.\n\n(3) Includes additional guarantees entered into as part of the\nextension and amendment of the American Airlines co-branded\ncredit card partnership agreement, executed in December 2024.\nSee \u201cCredit Card Arrangements with Partners\u201d in Note 28 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K. Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of\nactual potential loss exposure based on historical and expected\nfuture performance of the portfolio.\n\n(4) Includes guarantees of subsidiaries.\n\n(5) In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an\nagreement that indemnifies certain subsidiaries of the Company\nagainst certain matters related to the business operated by the\nCompany through other subsidiaries, including certain existing,\nas well as potential future, legal proceedings, including tax\nmatters. Certain of such indemnification obligations have no\nstated expiration date and are not subject to specific\nlimitations on the maximum potential amount of future payments\nthat the Company could be required to make. The Company is not\nable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments\nto be made under this agreement because the triggering events\nare not predictable.\n                              195                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse In addition to the amounts presented in\nthe tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $\n13million and $ 12million at March 31, 2025 and December 31,\n2024, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Futures and Over-\nthe-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services\non central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of\nnon-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post\nvariation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of\nthe client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of non-\nperformance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event\nthat the client fails to perform. Carrying Value\u2014Guarantees and\nIndemnifications At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the\ntotal carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the\nguarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above\namounted to approximately $ 1.0billion and $ 1.0billion,\nrespectively. The carrying value of financial and performance\nguarantees is included in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash\ncollateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under\nthese guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 53.1billion\nand $ 49.0billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 77.5billion and $ 62.5billion at March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities\nlending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in\nfavor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 2.8billion and $\n3.1billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to\ncover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications;\nhowever, the value of such property has not been determined.\n\nPerformance Risk\nPresented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts\nof future payments that are classified based on internal and\nexternal credit ratings. The determination of the maximum\npotential future payments is based on the notional amount of the\nguarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such,\nCiti believes such amounts bear no relationship to the\nanticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

to\npurchase certain debt and equity securities.\nThe majority of unused\ncommitments are contingent\nupon customers maintaining\nspecific credit standards.\nCommercial commitments\ngenerally have floating\ninterest rates and fixed\nexpiration dates and may\nrequire payment of fees. Such\nfees (net of certain direct\ncosts) are deferred and, upon\nexercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the\nloan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the\ncommitment period. Other\nCommitments As a Federal\nReserve member bank, Citi is\nrequired to subscribe to half\nof a certain amount of shares\nissued by its Federal Reserve\nDistrict Bank. As of March 31,\n2025 and December 31, 2024,\nCiti holds shares with a\ncarrying value of $\n4.5billion, with the remaining\nhalf subject to call by the\nFederal Reserve District Bank\nBoard. In the normal course of\nbusiness, Citi enters into\nreverse repurchase and\nsecurities borrowing\nagreements, as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nMarch 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, Citi had\napproximately $ 177.1billion\nand $ 117.7billion of\nunsettled reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, and approximately\n$ 174.5billion and $\n126.8billion of unsettled\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements,\nrespectively.

LEASES\n\nThe Company\u2019s operating\nleases, where Citi is a\nlessee, include real estate,\nsuch as office space and\nbranches, and various types of\nequipment. These leases may\ncontain renewal and extension\noptions and early termination\nfeatures; however, these\noptions do not impact the\nlease term unless the Company\nis reasonably certain that it\nwill exercise options.

CONTINGENCIES                                             \n                                                                \nThe following information supplements and amends, as applicable,\nthe disclosure in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note,\nCitigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and\nformer officers, directors, and employees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties. In\naccordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for\ncontingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, or tax\nmatters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable\nthat a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted\nfrom time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional\ninformation. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation\nto those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the\namounts accrued for those matters. With respect to previously\nincurred loss contingencies for which recovery is expected, Citi\napplies loss recovery accounting when disputes and uncertainties\naffecting recognition are resolved. If Citigroup has not accrued\nfor a matter because the matter does not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above), or Citigroup believes an exposure\nto loss exists in excess of the amount accrued for a particular\nmatter, in each case assuming a material loss is reasonably\npossible but not probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of\nthe aggregate reasonably possible loss or range of loss in\nexcess of the amounts accrued for those matters for which an\nestimate can be made. At March 31, 2025, Citigroup estimates\nthat the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters\nranges up to approximately $ 1.3billion in the aggregate. As\navailable information changes, the matters for which Citigroup\nis able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition, while many estimates presented in\nfinancial statements and other financial disclosures involve\nsignificant judgment and may be subject to significant\nuncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss\narising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are\nsubject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of\nmaking an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or\nincomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its\nassumptions about the future rulings of the court or other\ntribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives\nof adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to\nbe wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often\nnot amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative\nanalytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may\noccur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates\nbecause it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all\nthese reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued\nin relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included\nin the estimate.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current knowledge and after taking into\naccount its current accruals, that the eventual outcome of all\nmatters described in this Note would not be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition\nof Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or\nindeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the\ninherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters could, from time to time, have a\nmaterial adverse effect on Citigroup\u2019s consolidated results of\noperations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual\nperiods. For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup\u2019s\naccounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including\nfor any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nCiti\u2019s 2024 Form 10-K.
