Current Report on Form 8-K Item 8.01. Other\nEvents. On June 29, 2020, Citi announced that the Federal\nReserve Board communicated that Citi\u2019s interim Stress Capital\nBuffer (SCB) requirement would be 2.5% for the four quarter\nwindow of 4Q 2020 - 3Q 2021. Incorporating this SCB, and a GSIB\nsurcharge of 3%, results in a minimum regulatory requirement of\n10% for both Standardized (using SCB) and Advanced (using the\nCapital Conservation Buffer - \u201cCCB\u201d) Approaches relative to\nCiti\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.2% using Advanced\nApproaches as of the first quarter of 2020. Citi said that while\nit will continue to evaluate its planned capital actions\nrelative to the most recent financial and macroeconomic\nconditions, it believes it is well positioned to continue to\nsupport its customers and the broader economy, while also\ncontinuing with its planned capital actions. Citi\u2019s planned\ncapital actions include common dividends of $0.51 per share in\nthe third quarter and over the four quarters covered by the 2020\nCCAR cycle (i.e., 4Q 2020 - 3Q 2021), subject to approval of\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors, as well as the latest financial and\nmacroeconomic conditions.
