This year\u2019s\nAnnual Meeting will be held in\na virtual format through a live\nwebcast to facilitate\nstockholder attendance\nregardless of location and\nreduce the carbon footprint of\nCiti\u2019s activities. Details\nrelating to the Annual Meeting\nlogistics are provided in this\n2023 Proxy Statement and at www\n.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/\nCITI2023. At the Annual\nMeeting, stockholders will vote\non a number of important\nmatters. Please take the time\nto carefully read each of the\nproposals described in the\nProxy Statement. Thank you for\nyour support of Citi.\n                 \n  Sincerely,     \n  John C. Dugan  \n  Chair          \n  of the Board   \n                 \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n     \n  4  \n     \n2023 Board Letter to Stockholders\n\nEarly in 2022 at Investor Day, with the Board\u2019s full support,\nCiti laid out its key strategic and Transformation goals, both\nto improve its financial performance over time and to position\nitself to\nweather significant challenges. This proved timely, as the\nremainder of 2022 did indeed present some difficult and\nunexpected challenges,\nand Citi made real progress on its key goals in ways that helped\nthe company successfully navigate those challenges.\n\nOne such challenge, of course, was the series of events set in\nmotion\nby the war in Ukraine. When the war began, Citi had the largest\npresence of any U.S. bank in both Ukraine and Russia. Drawing on\nlong\nexperience in managing country risk, the company was able to\nkeep its operations running in Ukraine without interruption,\nwhile strongly\nsupporting our local employees. In Russia, Citi swiftly and\nsubstantially reduced its risk exposures and losses while taking\ndecisive\naction to begin winding down its operations. The Board is very\nproud of the agile and effective measures that management has\ntaken in\nboth countries.\n\nA second key challenge was macroeconomic, as inflation became so\npronounced for the first time since the 1980s that the Federal\nReserve was forced to embark on a historically sharp series of\ninterest\nrate hikes \u2013 a course of action that has profoundly impacted\nglobal markets and businesses, including Citi\u2019s.\n\nDespite\nthese challenges, Citi made substantial progress on the Board-\napproved strategic goals laid out at Investor Day. First, on the\ngoal\nto divest 14 non-U.S. consumer businesses, the firm announced\nclosings of five sales of consumer businesses in 2022; another\ntwo in\nthe first quarter of 2023; and that two more are on track to\nclose later in 2023. In addition, the firm made substantial\nprogress in\nthe wind downs of its consumer business in Korea and its overall\nbusiness in Russia, and announced the intent to wind down its\nconsumer business in China. And with respect to the consumer\nbusiness of Citibanamex \u2013 our largest consumer business outside\nthe\nUnited States \u2013 Citi made significant progress in a rigorous\nsales process to identify a buyer or, in the alternative, to\npursue an initial public offering. While there are near-term\ncosts associated with these divestitures, their net effect will\nsimplify Citi, significantly reduce the number of its employees,\nand release capital over time.\n\nCiti also delivered in 2022 on the short-term financial goals\nannounced\nat Investor Day. Due to the challenges described above, some of\nour businesses performed better than projected, and some worse.\nFor example,\nhigher interest rates significantly increased interest income\nand the performance of our credit card and services businesses,\nespecially\nthe Treasury and Trade Solutions business. Similarly,\nsignificant market volatility translated into a strong year for\nour markets business.\nOn the other hand, the precipitous decline in deal activity\nthroughout the world produced a down year for our banking\nbusiness, and the\ndecline in equity prices proved a significant headwind for parts\nof our Global Wealth business. Overall, our consolidated\nfinancial results\nfor the year were solid, as the company met or exceeded nearly\nall short-term Investor Day targets, most notably for increased\nrevenue;\ntotal expenses; a higher risk-based capital ratio; and well\nmanaged cost of credit. This demonstrated the strength of Citi\u2019s\ndiverse\nsources of income and management\u2019s ability to navigate the\nbusiness through periods of real uncertainty.\n\nWhile meeting short-term financial goals is important, the Board\nrecognizes that there remains a significant gap between the\nperformance of Citi and many of its large bank competitors. We\nare also keenly\naware of and disappointed in Citi\u2019s performance as measured by\nthe key metric of Total Shareholder Return. But the whole point\nof\nthe refreshed strategy announced at Investor Day is to change\nthe dynamic that has produced these outcomes: to simplify,\ndivest, adjust\nthe business mix, and transform our risk management and control\nenvironment. Most of these actions increase expenses in the near\nterm,\nbut they should reduce expenses and increase revenues in both\nthe mid- and longer term, which in turn will increase Citi\u2019s\ncritically\nimportant Return on Tangible Common Equity \u2013 and that, we\nbelieve, is the clearest path to increasing Total Shareholder\nReturn.\nManagement achieved the short-term goals of the first year of\nthe Investor Day strategy; now it must continue to execute to\nachieve the\ngoals in 2023 and beyond.\n\nTurning to the transformation of Citi\u2019s risk and control\nenvironment,\nthe end of 2022 marked the end of the Transformation\u2019s first,\nfoundational phase. Here also there was progress. With respect\nto\nthe Consent Orders entered into with the Federal Reserve and the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency that are directly\nrelated to\nthe Transformation, the Board determined that Citi prepared\nremediation plans that were responsive to the company\u2019s\nobjectives.\nIn addition, in terms of execution, management performed above\n90% relative to targets on each metric\n\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n     \n  5  \n     \ncategory for Phase I. Among\nthe key tangible outcomes are: new stress testing capabilities\nthat enable faster, better informed risk decisions, which proved\nextremely\nuseful in addressing the potential consequences from the war in\nUkraine; significantly improved standardization of our reporting\nledgers;\na greatly streamlined approval process for new products; and\nestablishment of comprehensive new governance and prioritization\nprocesses\nfor improving Citi\u2019s data quality.\n\nNotwithstanding this progress, the Board recognizes that Phase 1\nwas just that: the earliest, foundational phase with a\nchallenging list of outcomes to achieve in subsequent phases to\nsuccessfully transform\nCiti\u2019s risk and control environment. The Board\u2019s Transformation\nOversight Committee is focusing its oversight, in Phase 2\nand beyond, on management\u2019s execution resulting in measurable\nand tangible improvements in Risk Management and Controls \u2013\nnot just at the end of the Transformation, but during every\nphase along the way.\n\nIn sum, 2022 was a year in which Citi set forth a clear strategy\nand took concrete measures to successfully execute the near-term\ngoals of that strategy. Your Board of Directors believes that,\ndespite\nsome difficult and unusual challenges, the company is on track \u2013\nbut with more work to do as we move forward with the refreshed\nstrategy and the Transformation.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support of Citi. Dialogue\nwith stockholders is a fundamental feature of a well governed\norganization, and we will continue to make it a priority. Please\nwrite with\nany concerns or suggestions to: Citigroup Inc.

Through this commitment, we will finance     \n  and facilitate an array of climate solutions such as          \n  renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable              \n  transportation and circular economy and social finance        \n  solutions including affordable housing, diversity and         \n  equity, economic inclusion, food security and healthcare. As  \n  of year-end 2022, we have financed and facilitated over $345  \n  billion in activities that contribute towards our $1          \n  trillion commitment.                                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Climate Change                                                \n  Citi announced its net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions    \n  commitment in 2021,                                           \n  which targets net zero GHG emissions for our financing by     \n  2050 as well as net zero GHG emissions for our operations by  \n  2030. We published                                            \n  our initial Net Zero Plan in early 2022 in our 2021 Task      \n  Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)         \n  Report, including baseline                                    \n  emissions and 2030 targets for Energy and Power loan          \n  portfolios. In our subsequent 2022 TCFD Report, we published  \n  2030 targets for four                                         \n  additional loan portfolios: Auto Manufacturing, Commercial    \n  Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining.

Since 2018, we have       \n  disclosed our adjusted and unadjusted (or \u201craw\u201d) pay gaps     \n  for both women and minorities and in the same year, we set    \n  goals to increase women leadership globally and Black         \n  leadership in the United States at the firm by the end of     \n  2021. After meeting and exceeding these goals, Citi           \n  announced new 2025 aspirational diversity representation      \n  goals. The new goals are more global and are inclusive of     \n  additional dimensions of diversity. In 2022, we promoted one  \n  of the largest and most diverse Managing Director (MD)        \n  classes in Citi\u2019s history \u2013 including 110 women, which is     \n  the most women promoted to MD ever. Last year, Citi also      \n  expanded the use of diverse slates in its recruiting efforts  \n  to have at least two women or minorities interviewed for all  \n  U.S.-based roles and at least two women interviewed for       \n  global roles at the AVP to MD levels. To retain and develop   \n  our talent, we support internal mobility by investing in      \n  career development programs, mentorship, networking,          \n  rotational programs and initiatives with our global employee  \n  resource groups.                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Action for Racial Equity                                      \n  In September 2020, building on our longstanding focus on      \n  advancing financial inclusion and economic opportunity for    \n  communities of color in the United States, Citi and the Citi  \n  Foundation announced our Action for Racial Equity initiative  \n  to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic     \n  mobility. The effort aims to provide greater access to        \n  banking and credit in communities of color, increase          \n  investment in Black-owned businesses, expand affordable       \n  housing and homeownership among Black Americans and advance   \n  anti-racist practices in our company and the financial        \n  services industry.

The following\nsupplements that discussion by summarizing the principal\nexecutive compensation decisions we made for 2022. CEO\nCompensation The Compensation, Performance Management and\nCulture Committee (Compensation Committee) set Ms. Fraser\u2019s\ntotal compensation for 2022, her first full year as our Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO), at $24.5 million, consisting of a base\nsalary of $1.5 million and an incentive award of $23 million.\nThat determination was primarily based on its conclusion that\nMs. Fraser\u2019s leadership in furtherance of the achievement of\nCiti\u2019s strategic objectives during 2022 was exemplary. In\nsetting the amount of Ms. Fraser\u2019s incentive award, the\nCommittee took into account absolute and relative total returns\nfor Citi\u2019s shareholders for 2022 as well as an analysis of\nmarket levels of pay for CEOs of peer companies. 2022 was Ms.\nFraser\u2019s first full calendar year as our CEO. She established a\nclear set of priorities for Citi to increase shareholder value\nover time. These priorities are Citi\u2019s Transformation, Strategic\nRefresh, and Improved Culture and Talent. Executing these\npriorities is expected to generate improved returns over the\nmedium-term. Notwithstanding challenging macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical developments, under Ms. Fraser\u2019s leadership Citi\nmade solid progress on each of our priorities, and the\nCompensation Committee recognized the strategic direction that\ntook shape during 2022. That progress included:\n                                                                \n     putting a strategic plan in place focused on five          \n  \u2022  interconnected businesses designed to create long-term     \n     value for our shareholders and to simplify the firm        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     executing on our strategy refresh, closing the sales of    \n     consumer businesses in five markets, as well               \n     as signing agreements for the sales of businesses in four  \n  \u2022  other consumer markets,  making substantial progress on    \n     the wind down of consumer                                  \n     businesses in two other markets and announcing the wind    \n     down of our consumer business in China                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     bringing very strong talent into the firm and              \n  \u2022  strengthening our culture of enhanced accountability,      \n     excellence,                                                \n     and shareholder alignment                                  \n                                                                \n                                                        \n  \u2022  strengthening Citi\u2019s risk and control environment  \n                                                        \n                                                                \n     progress on remediating the issues identified in the       \n     Consent Orders issued in 2020 by the Federal               \n  \u2022  Reserve Board (FRB) and the Office of the Comptroller of   \n     the Currency (OCC) (Consent Orders) and on other           \n     outstanding regulatory issues                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Ms.                                                           \n  Fraser\u2019s incentive compensation was delivered in three        \n  parts. First, 35% of total incentive compensation was         \n  delivered in the                                              \n  form of deferred Citi common stock awards, an increase from   \n  20% in 2021. Second, 15% of total incentive compensation for  \n  2022 was                                                      \n  paid in cash at the beginning of 2023, a decrease from 30%    \n  in 2021. The changes from 2021 were designed to further       \n  align Ms.                                                     \n  Fraser\u2019s incentive compensation with the interests of         \n  shareholders. Third, the remainder of Ms.\u00a0Fraser\u2019s incentive  \n  compensation, 50% of total incentive compensation, was        \n  delivered in the form of Performance Share Units (PSUs).      \n                                                                \nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  Executive                                                     \n  Compensation and Human Capital Resources and Management   17  \n  Highlights                                                    \n                                                                \nOther Executive Compensation Citi has since 2013 delivered a\nportion of incentive compensation for our Executive Management\nTeam (EMT) in the form of PSUs. For 2022, we expanded the use of\nPSUs in our compensation program, so that members of our Global\nOperating Team also receive PSUs in addition to deferred stock\nand immediate cash awards where permitted by local law. The\nCompensation Committee determined not to make any payments in\nrespect of PSUs granted as part of our 2019 incentive\ncompensation awards, on the basis that performance during the\nthree-year performance period for those awards, from 2020\nthrough 2022, did not meet threshold achievement levels. To\nincentivize effective execution in connection with the Consent\nOrder programs and to drive change in Citi\u2019s risk and control\nenvironment and culture, in August 2021 the Compensation\nCommittee approved a long-term performance-based bonus program\n(the Transformation Bonus Program). Following the completion of\nthe first performance measurement period under the\nTransformation Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee\ndetermined that the Performance Achievement Percentage for that\nperiod would be 94%, reflecting the Compensation Committee\u2019s\nassessment of performance relative to the preset targets\nestablished for that Program. While Ms. Fraser is not eligible\nto participate in the Transformation Bonus Program, all other\nmembers of our EMT at the time the Program was adopted, as well\nas approximately 250 other employees who are deemed to be\ncritical to execution in connection with the Consent Order\nprograms, are eligible to participate. The targets established\nfor the first performance period included the submission by Citi\nto our regulators of plans to remediate the issues addressed by\nthe Consent Orders. Citi provides both regulators on an ongoing\nbasis information regarding its plans and progress and continues\nto work constructively with the regulators to reflect their\nfeedback on remediation efforts. The Citi Board of Directors has\ndetermined that our plans are responsive to our objectives and\nthat we continue to make progress on our execution.

Citi\u2019s new Leadership Principles of \u201ctaking\nownership, delivering with pride and succeeding together\u201d have\nbeen reinforced through a behavioral science-led campaign,\nCiti\u2019s New Way, that reinforces the key working habits that\nsupport Citi\u2019s leadership culture. Citi\u2019s performance management\napproach also emphasizes the Leadership Principles through a new\nfour-pillar system, evaluating what colleagues deliver against\nfinancial performance, risk and control, and client and\nfranchise goals as well as how colleagues deliver from a\nleadership perspective. The performance management and incentive\ncompensation processes and associated policies and frameworks\nhave been redesigned to enhance accountability through increased\nrigor and consistency, in particular for risk and controls. The\nculture shift is also being supported by changes in the way Citi\nidentifies, assesses, develops and promotes talent, particularly\nat the most senior levels of the organization. Diversity, Equity\nand Inclusion Citigroup\u2019s Board is committed to ensuring that\nthe Board and Citi\u2019s EMT are composed of individuals whose\nbackgrounds reflect the diversity of Citi\u2019s employees, customers\nand other stakeholders. In addition, Citi has increased its\nefforts to diversify its workforce, including, among other\nthings, taking actions with respect to pay equity, setting\nrepresentation goals and using diverse slates in recruiting. Pay\nTransparency and Pay Equity Citi values pay transparency and has\ntaken significant action to ensure that both managers and\nemployees have greater clarity around Citi\u2019s compensation\nphilosophy. Over the past two years, Citi introduced market-\nbased salary structures and bonus opportunity guidelines in\nvarious countries worldwide. In addition, Citi recently began\nposting salary ranges on all external U.S. job postings, which\naligns with strategic objectives of pay equity and transparency.\nCiti also raised its U.S. minimum wage in 2022, the second\nbroad-based increase in less than two years. Citi has focused on\nmeasuring and addressing pay equity within the organization:\n                                                                \n     In 2018, Citi was the first major U.S. financial           \n     institution to publicly release the results of a pay       \n     equity review comparing its compensation of women to that  \n     of men, as well as that of U.S. minorities to U.S.         \n     non-minorities. Since 2018,                                \n     Citi has continued to be transparent about pay equity,     \n  \u2022  including disclosing its unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap for   \n     both women                                                 \n     and U.S. minorities. The raw pay gap measures the          \n     difference in median compensation. The existence of        \n     Citi\u2019s raw pay gap reflects                                \n     a need to increase representation of women and U.S.        \n     minorities in senior and higher-paying roles.              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Citi\u2019s 2022 pay equity review determined that on an        \n     adjusted basis, women globally are paid on                 \n  \u2022  average more than 99% of what men are paid at Citi, and    \n     that there was not a statistically significant difference  \n     in adjusted compensation                                   \n     between U.S. minorities and non-minorities.                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Citi\u2019s 2022 raw pay gap analysis showed that the median    \n     pay for women globally is 78% of the median                \n  \u2022  for men, up from 74% in 2021 and 2020. The raw median pay  \n     for U.S. minorities is more than 97% of the raw median     \n     for non-minorities, which                                  \n     is up from just above 96% in 2021 and 94% in 2020.         \n                                                                \nRepresentation Goals Citi\u2019s management believes that a diverse\nworkforce is key to the Company\u2019s success in serving diverse\nclients and communities. In 2022, Citi announced that it\nexceeded its Company-wide, aspirational diversity representation\ngoals for 2018\u20132021 to increase its percentages of women\ncolleagues globally and Black talent in the U.S. Citi 2023 Proxy\nStatement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  Executive                                                     \n  Compensation and Human Capital Resources and Management   19  \n  Highlights                                                    \n                                                                \nRecognizing that this was just a starting point, Citi has set\nnew goals for 2025. The new goals are more global, embrace more\ndimensions of diversity and include all levels of the Company.\nCiti\u2019s 2025 aspirational representation goals are embedded in\nits business strategy. Citi has goals for hiring and promoting\ncolleagues into roles at the AVP to MD levels across the\norganization, as well as goals for campus hiring from colleges\nand universities. Having aspirational goals across all\nlevels\u2014from early career through senior leadership roles\u2014will\nhelp ensure Citi not only has diverse talent in leadership\nroles, but will also help the Company build a diverse talent\npipeline for the future. Workforce Development Citi\u2019s numerous\nprogrammatic offerings aim to reinforce its culture and values,\nfoster understanding of compliance requirements and develop\ncompetencies required to deliver excellence to its clients. Citi\nencourages career growth and development by offering broad and\ndiverse opportunities to colleagues, including the following:\n                                                                \n     Citi provides a range of internal development and          \n     rotational programs to colleagues at all levels,           \n     including                                                  \n     an extensive leadership curriculum, allowing the           \n  \u2022  opportunity to build the skills needed to transition to    \n     supervisory and managerial roles.                          \n     Citi\u2019s tuition assistance program further enables          \n     colleagues in North America to pursue their educational    \n     goals.                                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Citi has a focus on internal talent development and aims   \n     to provide colleagues with career growth opportunities,    \n     with more than 33,000 open positions filled internally in  \n  \u2022  2022. These opportunities are particularly important as    \n     Citi focuses on providing                                  \n     career paths for its internal talent base as part of its   \n     efforts to increase organic growth and promotions within   \n     the organization.                                          \n                                                                \nWellness and Benefits Citi is proud to provide a wide range of\nbenefits that support its colleagues mentally, emotionally,\nphysically and financially and through various life stages and\nevents. The Company is focused on providing equitable benefits\nthat are designed to attract, engage and retain colleagues. Citi\nhas significantly enhanced mental well-being programs by\noffering free counseling sessions for colleagues and their\nfamily members and adding real-time text, video and message-\nbased counseling in the U.S, as well as offering an online tool\nso that all colleagues around the globe can easily find their\nlocal Employee Assistance Programs and resources. Citi also\ncontinues to value the importance of physical wellbeing \u2013\nproviding employees in several office locations and countries\naccess to onsite medical care clinics, fitness centers,\nsubsidized gym memberships and virtual fitness programs. Citi\ncontinues expanding employee benefits to support colleagues and\ntheir families. In early 2020, Citi expanded its Paid Parental\nLeave Policy to include Citi colleagues around the world. Citi\nalso began to offer additional leave opportunities to eligible\ncolleagues, including the \u201cRefresh, Recharge, Reenergize\u201d\nprogram, whereby employees are able to take up to 12 weeks for a\nsabbatical to pursue a personal interest, and the \u201cGiving Back\u201d\nprogram, allowing employees to take up to four weeks to work\nwith a charitable institution. In 2022, Citi implemented a\nglobal, flexible work approach to provide colleagues with the\nability to balance the demands of their home lives with the work\nconditions that are necessary for success. The \u201cHow We Work\u201d\napproach includes a new work model for Citi, defined by three\nrole designations for colleagues globally: Resident, Hybrid or\nRemote. By embracing a hybrid model of work, Citi has focused on\nkeeping its approach consistent and aligned with its values and\npriorities.

The full text\nof the Guidelines,\nas approved by the Board, is set forth on Citi\u2019s website at\nwww.citigroup.com. Click on \u201cInvestors,\u201d then \u201cCorporate\nGovernance,\u201d and then \u201cCorporate Governance Guidelines.\u201d The\nGuidelines outline the responsibilities, operations,\nqualifications,\nand composition of the Board. The following summarizes certain\nprovisions of the Guidelines.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nOur goal is that at least two-thirds of the members\nof the Board be independent. Descriptions of our independence\ncriteria and the results of the Board\u2019s independence\ndeterminations\nare set forth below.\n\nBoard Committees\n\nThe Guidelines require that all members of the following\ncommittees of the Board be independent: Audit; Compensation,\nPerformance Management and Culture; and Nomination, Governance\nand Public\nAffairs. Committee members are appointed by the Board upon the\nrecommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee.\nCommittee membership and Chairs are rotated periodically. The\nBoard and each Committee have the power to hire and fire\nindependent legal,\nfinancial, or other advisors, as they may deem necessary,\nwithout consulting or obtaining the approval of management.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                  \n  22  Corporate   \n      Governance  \n                  \nAdditional Board Service\n\nThe number of other for-profit public or non-public\ncompany boards on which a Director may serve is subject to\nreview and approval by the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee,\nin order to ensure that each Director is able to devote\nsufficient time to perform his or her duties as a Director. On\nan annual basis,\nthe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee reviews\nall for-profit and not-for-profit affiliations of Citi\u2019s Board\nmembers.\nSubject to the discretion of the Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee, a Director may not serve on more than\nfive for-profit\npublic company boards, including Citigroup\u2019s Board, and a\nDirector who is the Chief Executive Officer of a public company\nmay not\nserve on more than three for-profit public company boards,\nincluding Citigroup\u2019s Board. Members of the Audit Committee may\nnot serve\non more than three public company audit committees, including\nCiti\u2019s Audit Committee. In accordance with Citi\u2019s Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, no Board nominee serves on more than five\nfor-profit public company boards and no Audit Committee member\nserves\non more than three public company audit committees. Our CEO does\nnot sit on any for profit company Boards besides Citi. In\naddition, under\nthe Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board members are required\nto disclose significant changes in professional responsibilities\nto the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee for\nconsideration including Board or Board Committee leadership\npositions.\n\nChange in Status or Responsibilities\n\nIf a Director has a substantial change in professional\nresponsibilities, occupation, or business association, he or she\nis required to notify the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee\nand to offer his or her resignation from the Board. The\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee will\nevaluate the facts and\ncircumstances and make a recommendation to the Board whether to\naccept the resignation or request that the Director continue to\nserve\non the Board. If a Director assumes a significant role in a not-\nfor-profit entity, he or she is asked to notify the Nomination,\nGovernance\nand Public Affairs Committee.\n\nAttendance at Meetings\n\nDirectors are expected to attend Board meetings\nand meetings of the Committees on which they serve, and the\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders. All of the Directors then in\noffice attended\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Virtual Annual Meeting.\n\nEvaluation of Board Performance\n\nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\nconducts an annual review of Board performance in which the full\nBoard participates, and each standing committee (except for the\nExecutive\nCommittee) conducts its own self-evaluation. As part of the\nself-evaluation, the Board engages in an examination of its own\nperformance\nof its obligations with regard to such matters as regulatory\nrequirements, strategic and financial oversight, oversight of\nrisk management,\nexecutive compensation, succession planning, and governance,\namong many other topics. The committees evaluate their\nperformance against\nthe requirements of their charters and other aspects of their\nresponsibilities. The Board Chair conducts one-on-one interviews\nwith each\nboard member. The full Board and each committee then discuss the\nresults of their respective self-evaluations in executive\nsession, highlighting\nactions to be taken in response to the discussion. See Board\nSelf-Assessment Process on page 29 for further information.\n\nDirectors Access to Senior Management and Director\nOrientation\n\nDirectors have full and free access to senior management\nand other employees of Citi. New Directors are provided with an\norientation program to familiarize them with Citi\u2019s businesses,\nregions, and functions as well as its legal, compliance,\nregulatory, and risk profile. Citi provides educational sessions\non a variety\nof topics throughout the year for all members of the Board.\nThese sessions are designed to allow Directors to develop a\ndeeper understanding\nof, for example, a business issue or a complex financial\nproduct.\n\nSuccession Planning\n\nThe Board reviews the Compensation, Performance\nManagement and Culture Committee\u2019s report on the performance of\nsenior executives in order to ensure that they are providing the\nhighest quality leadership for Citi. The Board also works with\nthe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee to\nevaluate potential\n\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                  \n  Corporate   23  \n  Governance      \n                  \nsuccessors to the CEO. With respect to regular succession\nof the CEO and senior management, Citi\u2019s Board evaluates\ninternal, and, when appropriate, external candidates. To find\nexternal\ncandidates, Citi seeks input from the members of the Board,\nsenior management, and from recruiting firms. To develop\ninternal candidates,\nCiti engages in a number of practices, formal and informal,\ndesigned to familiarize the Board with Citi\u2019s talent pool. The\nformal\nprocess involves an annual talent review conducted by senior\nmanagement at which the Board studies the most promising members\nof senior\nmanagement. The Board learns about each person\u2019s experience,\nskills, areas of expertise, accomplishments, and goals. This\nreview\nis conducted at a regularly scheduled Board meeting on an annual\nbasis. In addition, members of senior management are\nperiodically asked\nto make presentations to the Board at Board meetings and Board\nstrategy sessions. These presentations are made by senior\nmanagers of the\nvarious business units as well as those who serve in corporate\nfunctions. The purpose of the formal review and other\ninteraction is to\nensure that Board members are familiar with the talent pool\ninside and outside Citi from which the Board would be able to\nchoose successors\nto the CEO and evaluate succession for other senior managers as\nnecessary from time to time.\n\nCharitable Contributions\n\nIf a Director, or an immediate family member who\nshares the Director\u2019s household, serves as a director, trustee,\nor executive officer of a foundation, university, or other not-\nfor-profit\norganization, and such entity receives contributions from Citi\nand/or the Citi Foundation, such contributions must be reported\nto the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee at least\nannually.\n\nInsider Investments and Transactions\n\nMembers of Citi\u2019s Board\nof Directors and Citi\u2019s executive officers (i.e., Section 16\nInsiders) are not permitted to hedge their Citi securities or to\npledge\ntheir Citi securities as collateral for a loan. The Guidelines\nrestrict certain financial transactions between Citi and its\nsubsidiaries\non the one hand and Directors, senior management, and their\nimmediate family members on the other. Personal loans from Citi\nor its subsidiaries\nto Citi\u2019s Directors and its most senior executives, or immediate\nfamily members who share any such person\u2019s household, are\nprohibited, except for margin loans to employees of a broker-\ndealer subsidiary of Citi, mortgage loans, home equity loans,\nconsumer loans,\ncredit cards, and overdraft checking privileges, all made on\nmarket terms in the ordinary course of business. See Certain\nTransactions and Relationships, Compensation Committee\nInterlocks, and Insider Participation on pages 37-39.\n\nThe Guidelines prohibit investments or transactions\nby Citi or its executive officers and those immediate family\nmembers who share an executive officer\u2019s household in a\npartnership\nor other privately held entity in which an outside Director is a\nprincipal, or in a publicly traded company in which an outside\nDirector\nowns or controls more than a 10% interest. Directors and those\nimmediate family members who share the Director\u2019s household are\nnot\npermitted to receive initial public offering allocations.\nDirectors and their immediate family members may participate in\nCiti-sponsored\ninvestment activities, provided they are offered on the same\nterms as those offered to similarly situated non-affiliated\npersons. Under\ncertain circumstances, or with the approval of the appropriate\ncommittee, members of senior management may participate in\ncertain Citi-sponsored\ninvestment opportunities. Finally, there is a prohibition on\ncertain investments by Directors and executive officers in\nthird-party entities\nwhen the opportunity comes solely as a result of their position\nwith Citi.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nThe Board has adopted categorical standards to assist\nthe Board in evaluating the independence of each of its\nDirectors. The categorical standards, which are set forth below,\ndescribe various\ntypes of relationships that could potentially exist between a\nDirector or an immediate family member of a Director and Citi,\nand set thresholds\nat which such relationships would be deemed to be material.\nProvided that no relationship or transaction exists that would\ndisqualify\na Director under the categorical standards and no other\nrelationships or transactions exist of a type not specifically\nmentioned in the\ncategorical standards that, in the Board\u2019s opinion, taking into\naccount all facts and circumstances, would impair a Director\u2019s\nability to exercise his or her independent judgment, the Board\nwill deem such person to be independent.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                  \n  24  Corporate   \n      Governance  \n                  \nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\nreviewed certain information obtained from Directors\u2019 responses\nto a questionnaire asking about their relationships with Citi,\nand\nthose of their immediate family members and primary business or\ncharitable affiliations and other potential conflicts of\ninterest, as\nwell as certain data collected by Citi\u2019s businesses related to\ntransactions, relationships, or arrangements between Citi on the\none hand and a Director, immediate family member of a Director,\nor a primary business or charitable affiliation of a Director,\non the\nother. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee\nalso reviewed certain relationships or transactions between the\nDirectors\nor immediate family members of the Directors or their primary\nbusiness or charitable affiliations and Citi and determined that\nthe relationships\nor transactions complied with the Corporate Governance\nGuidelines and the related categorical standards.

The Board believes \nit is important                                                 \nto maintain flexibility in its Board leadership structure and   \nhas had in place different leadership structures in the past,   \ndepending                                                       \non the Company\u2019s needs at the time, but firmly supports having  \nan independent Director in a Board leadership position at all   \ntimes.                                                          \nAccordingly, Citi\u2019s Board, on December 15, 2009, adopted a By-  \nlaw amendment which provides that if Citi does not have an      \nIndependent                                                     \nChair, the Board will elect a lead independent Director having  \nsimilar duties to an independent Chair, including leading the   \nexecutive                                                       \nsessions of the non-management Directors at Board meetings.     \nCiti\u2019s Chair provides independent leadership of the Board.      \nHaving an                                                       \nindependent Chair or Lead Director enables non-management       \nDirectors to raise issues and concerns for Board consideration  \nwithout immediately                                             \ninvolving management. The Chair or Lead Director also serves as \na liaison between the Board and senior management and regularly \nmeets                                                           \nwith Citi\u2019s stockholders, stakeholders, and regulators on behalf\nof the Company. Citi\u2019s Board has determined that the current    \nstructure, an independent Chair separate from the CEO, is the   \nmost appropriate structure at this time, while ensuring that, at\nall times,                                                      \nthere will be an independent Director in a Board leadership     \nposition. The Board believes its approach to risk oversight,    \nwhich includes:                                                 \n(i) a report at every regular Board meeting from the Chief Risk \nOfficer on significant risk matters for discussion with the     \nBoard, (ii)                                                     \na standing Risk Management Committee of the Board and (iii) a   \ndirect reporting line of the Chief Risk Officer to the Risk     \nManagement                                                      \nCommittee, ensures that the Board can choose many leadership    \nstructures without experiencing a material impact on its        \noversight of risk.                                              \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                  \n  28  Corporate   \n      Governance  \n                  \nBoard Diversity\n\nDiversity is among the critical factors that the\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee considers\nwhen evaluating the composition of the Board. For a Company like\nCiti, which\noperates in more than 100 countries around the globe, diversity\nincludes race, ethnicity, nationality, and gender as well as the\ndiversity\nof the communities and geographies in which Citi operates.\nIncluded in the qualifications for Directors listed in the\nCompany\u2019s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines is \u201cwhether the candidate has\nspecial skills, expertise and background that would complement\nthe\nattributes of the existing Directors, taking into consideration\nthe diverse communities and geographies in which Citi operates.\u201d\nCiti\u2019s Board is committed to ensuring that it is composed of\nindividuals whose backgrounds reflect the diversity represented\nby\nour employees, customers, and stakeholders. When considering new\nDirector candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public\nAffairs Committee\ninstructs its recruiting firm to include diverse candidates in\neach slate. In this context, eight of the candidates nominated\nfor election\nat Citi\u2019s 2023 Annual Meeting are diverse. In addition, each\nDirector candidate contributes to the Board\u2019s overall diversity\nby providing a variety of perspectives, personal and\nprofessional experiences, and backgrounds, as well as other\ncharacteristics, such\nas global and international business experience. The Board\nbelieves that the current nominees reflect an appropriate\ndiversity of gender,\nage, race, national origin, geographical background, and\nexperience and is committed to continuing to consider diversity\nin evaluating\nthe composition of the Board.\n\nDirector Education Program\n\nCiti has a robust Director Education Program that\nbegins with an orientation for newly appointed Directors,\nproviding two days of in-depth training covering all aspects of\nour business,\nincluding, among other things, coverage of Citi\u2019s institutional\nand consumer businesses; our regional operations; an overview of\nthe Company\u2019s risk management, audit, compliance, operations and\ntechnology, governance, regulatory, finance, human capital\nmanagement,\ngovernment affairs, and legal functions; and an overview of\nCiti\u2019s primary banking subsidiary, Citibank, N.A. There is also\na continuing\neducation program, which includes presentations focusing on\nindustry, regulatory and governance topics and presentations\nfrom the various\nlines of our business on emerging issues or strategic\ninitiatives to provide our Directors with the opportunity to\nexpand their insight\ninto Citi\u2019s business operations and activities. Directors also\nhave access to external programming and seminars to supplement\ntheir\nCiti-provided education. In 2022, the Directors received\ntraining on various topics, including ESG matters, Political\nContributions, Net\nZero, Technology, including the Cloud and Cybersecurity,\nRegulation O, Community Reinvestment Act, Fair Lending, Bank\nSecrecy Act / Anti-Money\nLaundering, Risk Appetite, Equities, Digital Assets, and\nInternational Business Franchises, among other topics.\n\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                  \n  Corporate   29  \n  Governance      \n                  \nBoard Self-Assessment Process\n                                                                \n  Annual Board Self-Evaluations*                                \n  The Board conducts annual evaluations through the use of      \n  both individual interviews by the Chair with each Board       \n  member and a written                                          \n  questionnaire completed by all Board members that covers a    \n  broad range of matters relating to governance, meetings,      \n  materials, and other                                          \n  agenda topics, including Strategic Planning, Corporate        \n  Oversight, Succession Planning, Conduct and Culture,          \n  Corporate Governance, Risk                                    \n  Management Oversight, Regulatory Requirements, and            \n  Management Compensation.                                      \n  Written Evaluations                                           \n  Citi\u2019s Corporate Governance Office coordinated a review of    \n  the form of Board self-assessment questionnaires proposed     \n  for 2022, and                                                 \n  recommended changes that were implemented for the Board\u2019s     \n  2022 self-assessment.

Accordingly, Citi has established an\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework to ensure that all of\nCiti\u2019s\nrisks are managed appropriately and consistently across Citi and\nat an aggregate, enterprise-wide level. The ERM Framework\ndetails the\nprinciples used to support effective enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement across the end-to-end risk management lifecycle. The\nERM Framework\nalso provides clarity on risk management roles and\nresponsibilities of the Citigroup Board of Directors, Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management\nTeam and employees across the lines of defense. Citi\u2019s culture\nand values drive a strong risk and control environment, and are\nat\nthe heart of the ERM Framework, underpinning the way Citi\nconducts business. The activities that Citi engages in, and the\nrisks those\nactivities generate, must be consistent with Citi\u2019s Mission and\nValue Proposition and the key principles that guide it, as well\nas Citi\u2019s risk appetite.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                  \n  30  Corporate   \n      Governance  \n                  \nThe\nCitigroup Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of\nrisk management and holds the Executive Management Team\naccountable for\nimplementing the ERM Framework and managing risk within the\ndefined risk appetite as it meets its strategic objectives. The\nBoard of\nDirectors formed the Transformation Oversight Committee to\noversee management\u2019s progress as it relates to the broader\ntransformation of Citi and management\u2019s remediation of issues\nidentified under the Consent Order, dated October 7, 2020,\nentered into by Citi with the Federal Reserve Board (FRB Consent\nOrder), including issues related to our risk and control\nenvironment. A similar Committee was formed by the Citibank,\nN.A. (CBNA) Board to provide oversight of management\u2019s\nremediation of issues identified under the Consent Order, dated\nOctober 7, 2020, entered into by CBNA with the OCC (OCC Consent\nOrder and together with the FRB Consent Order, the Consent\nOrders). (Please see page 31 to review additional disclosure on\nthe\nTransformation Oversight Committee.) In addition, the Board of\nDirectors has delegated oversight of specific risks, as set\nforth\nbelow, to certain other Board committees, based on their\nmandates.\n\nCiti uses a lines of defense model as a key component\nof its ERM Framework to manage its risks. The lines of defense\nmodel brings together risk-taking, risk oversight and risk\nassurance under\none umbrella and provides an avenue for risk accountability of\nthe first line of defense, a construct for effective challenge\nby the second\nline of defense (Independent Risk Management and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management), and empowers independent risk\nassurance by the\nthird line of defense (Internal Audit). Citi has enterprise\nsupport functions that support safety and soundness across Citi.\nEach of the\nlines of defense and enterprise support functions, along with\nthe Board, are empowered to perform relevant risk management\nprocesses and\nresponsibilities in order to manage Citi\u2019s risks within the\ndefined risk appetite in a consistent and effective manner.\n\nFor more information about

Governance      \n                  \nAt each regularly scheduled Board meeting, the Board\nreceives a risk report from the Chief Risk Officer with respect\nto the Company\u2019s approach to management of major risks,\nincluding\nmanagement\u2019s risk mitigation efforts, where appropriate.\nIndependent Risk Management, led by the Chief Risk Officer, sets\nrisk and\ncontrol standards for the first line of defense and actively\nmanages and oversees\naggregate credit, market (trading and non-trading), liquidity,\nstrategic, operational and reputation risks across Citi,\nincluding risks\nthat span categories, such as concentration risk, country risk,\ncompliance risk, and climate risk. The Board\u2019s role is to\noversee\nthis effort.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee enhances the Board\u2019s\noversight of risk management. The Committee\u2019s role is one of\noversight, recognizing that management is responsible for\nexecuting\nCiti\u2019s risk management policies.\n\nTransformation Enhancements at Citi\n\nCiti is fully committed to a broad-based transformation\nof its risk management and controls. Citi believes the\nTransformation is essential, not only to address regulatory\nmatters in an effective,\ntimely, and sustainable manner, but also as a broader strategic\nimperative for the firm. Citi\u2019s priorities revolve around three\ninterconnected elements: the Transformation, strategy, and\nculture and talent. Driving toward excellence in risk and\ncontrols in the Transformation\nis mutually reinforcing with Citi\u2019s business strategy, and\nsuccess for both can only be achieved with significant shifts in\nculture\nand talent.\n\nThe Board established the Transformation Oversight\nCommittee in October 2020, to serve as the primary forum for\nBoard oversight of the Transformation. Given this overall\nresponsibility\nof the Transformation Oversight Committee and the need for\nholistic oversight, all non-management directors on the Board\nserve on the\nCommittee. The full Board focuses on non-Transformation matters\nin other forums.\n\nA series of Program Groups focus on specific requirements\nof the Consent Order. Certain members of the Transformation\nOversight Committee (Lead Directors) who have been assigned to\nthe various\nProgram Groups, work closely with the Executive Management Team\nmembers responsible for the relevant Program Groups to provide\noversight\nand challenge to the Program Groups as they prepare for meetings\nwith the entire Transformation Oversight Committee, in much the\nsame\nway as Board Committee Chairs interact with individual Executive\nManagement Team members in preparation for committee meetings.\n\nBoard\u2019s Role in Cybersecurity Oversight\n\nThe Board directly or through one or more Committees\nprovide oversight of Management\u2019s efforts to mitigate\ncybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents. The Board\nand/or one or\nmore Committees receive regular reports on cybersecurity and\nengage in discussions throughout the year with Management and\nsubject-matter\nexperts on the effectiveness of Citi\u2019s overall cybersecurity\nprogram, cybersecurity risks, Citi\u2019s strategies for addressing\nthese risks, and Citi\u2019s implementation thereof. Board and\nCommittee members receive reporting on significant cyber events\nincluding\nresponse efforts, legal obligations, and outreach and\nnotification to regulators and/or customers when needed, as well\nas provide guidance\nto management as appropriate. The Risk Management Committee has\napproved a standalone Cybersecurity Risk Appetite Statement\nagainst which\nCiti\u2019s performance is measured quarterly.\n\nBoard\u2019s Role in ESG Matters\n\nCiti\u2019s Board of\nDirectors has ultimate oversight of Citi\u2019s work to identify,\nassess and integrate ESG and sustainability-related risks and\nopportunities throughout Citi. In addition to oversight by the\nfull Board, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs\nCommittee\nof the Board oversees Citi\u2019s ESG activity, including reviewing\nour policies and programs for sustainability, climate change,\nhuman rights, diversity and other ESG matters. The Risk\nManagement Committee of the Board reviews key risk policies,\nincluding those\nrelated to environmental, social and climate risk. The Audit\nCommittee has oversight over the controls and procedures related\nto\nCiti\u2019s group level ESG and climate-related reporting, including\nboth voluntary disclosures and regulatory filings. The\nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee has held a\nnumber of meetings to review shareholder proposals (including\nones\nrelated to fossil fuel financing and biodiversity) and received\nan ESG update in 2022.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                  \n  32  Corporate   \n      Governance  \n                  \nDuring\n2022, the Risk Management Committee received updates on climate\nrisk including the climate management framework, client-level\nclimate methodology and results of climate scenario analysis. In\n2022, at two meetings the Audit Committee reviewed\nexisting ESG disclosure controls and procedures. The Board also\nreceived reports from the Head of Community Investing and\nDevelopment on Citi and the Citi Foundation\u2019s social impact\nactivities and performance, including Action for Racial Equity\nand\nthe investments of the Citi Impact Fund. In addition, the Board\nreceived reports on Citi\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion\nefforts, including pay equity and representation goals, from the\nGlobal Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer and Global\nHead of Talent. Members of the Board also participated in\ninvestor calls on a variety of governance and environmental and\nsocial\nmatters, including climate risk.\n\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\n\nBelow are the standing committees of the Board of\nDirectors.

The transactions were made in the\nordinary course of business\non substantially the same terms, including interest rates and\ncollateral, that prevailed at the time for comparable\ntransactions with\nother persons not related to the lender and did not involve more\nthan the normal risk of collectability or present other\nunfavorable features.\nPersonal loans made to any Director or an executive officer must\ncomply with Sarbanes-Oxley, Regulation O, and the Corporate\nGovernance\nGuidelines, and must be made in the ordinary course of business.\n\nCiti\u2019s Hedging Policies\n\nCiti\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit\nthe hedging of Citi common stock held by Directors and executive\nofficers, whether the shares of stock are granted as\ncompensation or\nare otherwise held by the director or executive officer. For\nthis purpose, an executive officer means any person designated\nby Citi as\nan \u201cofficer\u201d under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\n\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct, which applies to all\nCiti employees, executive officers and Directors, states that\nwhen considering personal investments in Citi securities, an\nindividual\nmust avoid any personal trade or investment in a security,\nderivative, futures contract, commodity, or other financial\ninstrument if the\ntrade or investment might affect or appear to affect the\nindividual\u2019s ability to make unbiased business decisions for\nCiti.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                  \n  40  Corporate   \n      Governance  \n                  \nIn addition, Citi\u2019s Personal Trading and Investment\nPolicy (the PTIP) prohibits the hedging in any manner (other\nthan currency hedges) by Covered Persons (including directors\nand executive\nofficers) of unvested restricted stock or deferred stock awarded\nas compensation under Citi\u2019s Capital Accumulation Program. The\nPTIP also prohibits engaging in speculative transactions in Citi\nsecurities, including sales of naked calls and speculative\noption strategies,\nas well as any other transaction that would benefit from a\ndecline in the value of a Citi security. The PTIP generally\nallows Covered\nPersons (excluding directors and executive officers) to hedge\nvested long positions of then deliverable Citi securities.\nCovered Persons\nunder the PTIP include (but are not limited to) individuals who\n1) may have access to material non-public information regarding\nCiti,\n2) are employed by Citi\u2019s Institutional Clients Group, 3) are\nFINRA-registered employees or associates of any of Citi\u2019s U.S.\nbroker dealer entities, or 4) work in a securities or advisory\nbusiness in Citi Personal Wealth Management, as well as certain\nindividuals\nwho are related to Covered Persons. Because directors and\nexecutive officers who are Covered Persons under the PTIP are\nalso subject to\nthe hedging policy applicable to directors and executive\nofficers pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, a\nproposed transaction\nby a director or executive officer may be prohibited by\napplication of one policy even if the transaction would be\npermissible under the\nother policy.\n\nFinally, Citi maintains policies specific to U.K.\nand European regulatory requirements. These policies provide\nthat all employees in the applicable countries who receive a\nportion of their\nremuneration in stock or any other deferral mechanism designated\nby Citi must not take out insurance contracts or engage in\npersonal hedging\nstrategies, or remuneration or liability-related contracts of\ninsurance, that undermine, or may undermine, any risk alignment\neffects\nof their remuneration arrangements.\n\nReputation Risk Committees\n\nThe Reputation Risk Committees, management-level\ngovernance committees, govern the process by which material\nreputation risks are identified, measured, monitored, controlled\nand reported,\nand oversee that appropriate actions are taken in line with the\nfirmwide strategic objectives, risk appetite thresholds, and\nregulatory\nexpectations, while promoting a culture of risk awareness and\nhigh standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the\ncompany, consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s Mission and Value Proposition. Regional and Business\nReputation Risk Committees may escalate reputation risks for due\nconsideration by the Group Reputation Risk Committee at the\ncorporate level. The Group Reputation Risk Committee may\nescalate risks to\nthe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the\nBoard or another Committee of the Board, as appropriate.\n\nEthics, Conduct and Culture\n\nAt Citi, our mission is to serve as a trusted partner\nto our clients by responsibly providing financial services that\nenable growth and economic progress.\n\nWe foster a culture of ethics through our governance\nframework, programs and efforts that embed our culture and\nexpectations for behavior throughout the organization, and\ncollaboration with\nkey stakeholders outside Citi to improve Citi\u2019s and the banking\nindustry\u2019s culture.\n\nGovernance over Culture\n\nThe cornerstone of our approach to culture is our\ngovernance framework, which begins with a strong \u201ctone from the\ntop\u201d starting with the Citigroup Board of Directors.

On January 11, 2023, the   \nBoard elected Casper W. von Koskull to the Board of Directors.  \nMr. von Koskull was recommended as a candidate for election to  \nCiti\u2019s Board by Spencer Stuart, the Board\u2019s nominating          \nconsultant. Directors are not eligible to stand for re-election \nafter reaching the age of 72. If elected, each nominee will hold\noffice until the 2024 Annual Meeting or until his or her        \nsuccessor is elected and qualified.                             \n                                                                \nDirector Criteria and Nomination Process                        \n                                                                \nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee         \nconsiders all qualified candidates identified by members of the \nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, by other   \nmembers of the Board, by senior management, and by security     \nholders. During 2022, the Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to   \nassist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees.        \nStockholders who would like to propose a Director candidate for \nconsideration by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs  \nCommittee may do so by submitting the candidate\u2019s name, r\u00e9sum\u00e9, \nand biographical information to the attention of the Corporate  \nSecretary, Citigroup Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New  \nYork 10013. All proposals for nominations received by the       \nCorporate Secretary will be presented to the Committee for its  \nconsideration.                                                  \n                                                                \nIn considering the composition of the Board of Directors, the   \nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee inventories \nthe categories of risks faced by Citi, given its size, business \nmix, and geographical presence, and seeks to identify candidates\nwith the skills and experience necessary to enable the Board of \nDirectors to provide proper oversight of those risks. The       \nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee also takes  \nDirector tenure into consideration when making Director         \nnomination decisions and believes that it is desirable to       \nmaintain a mix of longer-tenured, experienced Directors and     \nnewer Directors with fresh perspectives. The Nomination,        \nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee and the Board also      \nbelieve that longer-tenured, experienced Directors are a        \nsignificant strength of the Board, given the large size of our  \nCompany, the breadth of our product offerings, and the          \ninternational scope of our organization. When nominating new    \ndirector candidates, the Nomination, Governance and Public      \nAffairs Committee instructs its recruiting firm to include      \ndiverse candidates in each slate. The Board\u2019s composition, and  \nthe individuals nominated for consideration by stockholders, are\nthe result of careful consideration by the Committee of the     \ncorrespondence between the risk inventory and skills and        \nexperience of the Board members and candidates. In addition to  \nthe ability to assist the Board in its oversight of a particular\nrisk or risks, as more fully described in each nominee\u2019s        \nbiography, the members of the Board are assessed based on a     \nvariety of factors, including the following criteria, which have\nbeen developed by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs \nCommittee and approved by the Board:                            \n                                                                \n     Whether                                                    \n  \u25cf  the candidate has exhibited behavior that indicates he or  \n     she is committed to the highest                            \n     ethical standards;                                         \n     Whether                                                    \n     the candidate has had business, governmental, non-profit   \n     or professional experience at the                          \n     chair, chief executive officer, chief operating officer,   \n     or equivalent policy-making and                            \n     operational level of a large organization with             \n  \u25cf  significant international activities across                \n     many regulatory jurisdictions and regions that indicates   \n     that the candidate will be able                            \n     to make a meaningful and immediate contribution to the     \n     Board\u2019s discussion of and decision-making                  \n     on the array of complex issues facing a large financial    \n     services business that operates on                         \n     a global scale;                                            \n     Whether                                                    \n     the candidate has special skills, expertise and a diverse  \n  \u25cf  background that would complement                           \n     the attributes of the existing Directors, taking into      \n     consideration the diverse communities                      \n     and geographies in which the Company operates;             \n     Whether                                                    \n     the candidate has the financial expertise required to      \n  \u25cf  provide effective oversight of a diversified               \n     financial services business that operates on a global      \n     scale;                                                     \n     Whether                                                    \n     the candidate has achieved prominence in his or her        \n     business, governmental, or professional                    \n  \u25cf  activities and has built a reputation that demonstrates    \n     the ability to make the kind of important                  \n     and sensitive judgments that the Board is called upon to   \n     make;                                                      \n                                                                \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                         \n  46  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                         \n                                                                \n     Whether                                                    \n     the candidate will effectively, consistently, and          \n     appropriately take into account and balance                \n  \u25cf  the legitimate interests and concerns of all of the        \n     Company\u2019s stockholders and other                           \n     stakeholders in reaching decisions, rather than advancing  \n     the interests of a particular constituency;                \n     Whether                                                    \n     the candidate possesses a willingness to challenge         \n  \u25cf  management while working constructively                    \n     as part of a team in an environment of collegiality and    \n     trust; and                                                 \n     Whether                                                    \n  \u25cf  the candidate will be able to devote sufficient time and   \n     energy to the performance of his                           \n     or her duties as a Director.                               \n                                                                \nApplication of these factors involves the exercise of judgment  \nby the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and  \nthe Board. In addition, see Board Diversityon page 28 for       \nadditional factors considered by the Board when selecting       \ncandidates.                                                     \n                                                                \nBased on its assessment of each candidate\u2019s independence, skills\nand qualifications and the criteria described above, the        \nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee will make   \nrecommendations regarding potential Director candidates to the  \nBoard.                                                          \n                                                                \nThe Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee follows \nthe same process and uses the same criteria for evaluating      \ncandidates proposed by stockholders, members of the Board of    \nDirectors, and members of senior management. For the 2023 Annual\nMeeting, we received timely notice from two stockholders who    \nproposed themselves for consideration to be nominated by the    \nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee to stand for\nelection at the Annual Meeting. The qualifications of the       \nindividuals were discussed at a meeting of the Nomination,      \nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee and the views of Spencer\nStuart were considered. After deliberation, the Committee       \ndecided not to include these two individuals on the slate of    \ncandidates it proposed to the full Board for consideration. The \nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee used the    \nabove-mentioned criteria to evaluate the candidates.            \n                                                                \nDirector Qualifications                                         \n                                                                \nThe nominees for the Board of Directors each have the           \nqualifications and experience to approve and guide Citi\u2019s       \nstrategy and to oversee management\u2019s execution of that strategic\nvision. Citi\u2019s Board of Directors consists of individuals with  \nthe skills, experience, and diverse backgrounds necessary to    \noversee Citi\u2019s efforts toward becoming a simpler, smaller,      \nsafer, and stronger financial institution, while mitigating risk\nand operating within a complex financial and regulatory         \nenvironment.                                                    \n                                                                \nThe nominees listed below are leaders in business, the financial\ncommunity, and academia because of their intellectual acumen and\nanalytical skills, strategic vision, ability to lead and inspire\nothers to work with them, and records of outstanding            \naccomplishments over a period of decades. Each has been chosen  \nto stand for election in part because of his or her ability and \nwillingness to ask difficult questions, understand Citi\u2019s unique\nchallenges, and evaluate the strategies proposed by management, \nas well as their implementation.                                \n                                                                \nEach of the nominees has a long record of professional          \nintegrity, a dedication to his or her profession and community, \na strong work ethic that includes a commitment to coming fully  \nprepared to meetings and being willing to spend the time and    \neffort needed to fulfill professional obligations and the       \nability to maintain a collegial environment.                    \n                                                                \nMany of our nominees are either current or former chief         \nexecutive officers or chairs of other large international       \ncorporations or have experience leading and operating large,    \ncomplex academic or governmental departments. As such, they have\na deep understanding of, and extensive experience in, many of   \nthe areas that are outlined below as being of critical          \nimportance to Citi\u2019s proper operation and success. For the      \npurposes of its analysis, the Board has determined that nominees\nwho have served as a chief executive officer or a chair of a    \nmajor corporation or large, complex institution have extensive  \nexperience with strategic planning, financial statement         \npreparation, compensation determinations, regulatory compliance \n(if their businesses are or were regulated), corporate          \ngovernance, public affairs, and legal matters.                  \n                                                                \nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                         \n  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  47  \n                                         \nIn evaluating the composition of the Board, the Nomination,     \nGovernance and Public Affairs Committee seeks to find and retain\nindividuals who, in addition to having the qualifications set   \nforth in Citi\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, have the       \nskills, experience and abilities necessary to meet Citi\u2019s unique\nneeds as a highly regulated financial services company with     \noperations in the corporate and consumer businesses within the  \nUnited States and more than 100 countries around the globe. The \nCommittee has determined it is critically important to Citi\u2019s   \nproper operation and success that its Board has, in addition to \nthe qualities described above, expertise and experience in the  \nfollowing areas:                                                \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s                                                        \n  Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee    \n  is responsible for determining                                \n  the compensation of the CEO and approving the compensation    \n  of other executive officers of                                \n  the Company and the Executive Management Team. In order to    \n  properly carry out its responsibilities                       \n  with respect to compensation, Citi\u2019s Board must include       \n  members who have experience                                   \n  evaluating the structure of compensation for senior           \n  executives. They must understand the                          \n  various forms of compensation that can be utilized, the       \n  purpose of each type and how various                          \n  elements of compensation can be used to motivate and reward   \n  executives and drive performance,                             \n  while not encouraging imprudent risk-taking or simply having  \n  short-term goals.                                             \n  Citi\u2019s                                                        \n  Personal Banking and Wealth Management, a global leader in    \n  banking, credit cards and wealth                              \n  management, is a critical growth engine for Citi. Globally,   \n  Citi continues to introduce industry-leading                  \n  digital capabilities, redesign the client experience, and     \n  embed its services in the most                                \n  popular social and e-commerce platforms, enabling customers   \n  to bank anytime, anywhere, on                                 \n  their channel of choice. Citi looks to its Board members      \n  with extensive consumer experience                            \n  to assist it in evaluating its business model and strategies  \n  for reaching and servicing its                                \n  retail customers domestically and around the world. It is     \n  critically important that its Board                           \n  include members who have consumer-oriented and financial      \n  services backgrounds.                                         \n  Citi                                                          \n  aspires to the highest standards of corporate governance and  \n  ethical conduct: doing what                                   \n  we say, reporting results with accuracy and transparency,     \n  and maintaining compliance with                               \n  the laws, rules, and regulations that govern the Company\u2019s    \n  businesses. The Board is                                      \n  responsible for shaping corporate governance policies and     \n  practices, including adopting the                             \n  corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company     \n  and monitoring the Company\u2019s                                  \n  compliance with governance policies and the guidelines. To    \n  carry out these responsibilities,                             \n  the Board must include experienced leaders in the area of     \n  corporate governance who must be                              \n  familiar with governance issues, the constituencies most      \n  interested in those issues, and                               \n  the impact that governance policies have on the functioning   \n  of a company.                                                 \n  Citi                                                          \n  has a long history as a technology innovator\u2013\u2013\u2013Citibank,      \n  N.A. was one of                                               \n  the first banks to offer automatic teller machines for its    \n  customers during the 1970s. As                                \n  Citi deploys new technology and platform innovations to       \n  gather, process, analyze, and provide                         \n  information to execute transactions and meet the needs of     \n  its clients and customers, Citi                               \n  must ensure that its operations are efficient and there is a  \n  continuous focus on enhancing                                 \n  productivity to meet its operational and strategic goals,     \n  while mitigating technology risks                             \n  through efforts to improve cybersecurity, data privacy, and   \n  data management efforts. The                                  \n  Board must include members who have knowledge and experience  \n  in technology, including such                                 \n  technology-centric issues as cybersecurity, data privacy and  \n  data management. Members of                                   \n  the Board must be qualified to provide oversight of the       \n  development and maintenance of Citi\u2019s                         \n  technology platforms; Citi\u2019s compliance with regulatory       \n  requirements; Citi\u2019s                                          \n  operational efficiency and productivity strategies; the       \n  operations and reliability of Citi\u2019s                          \n  systems; and the protection of client and customer data.      \n                                                                \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                         \n  48  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  \n                                         \n                                                                \n  ESG                                                           \n  is a critical business issue, with ties to both risk and      \n  opportunity. Citi has been engaged                            \n  in sustainability for over 20 years and views the             \n  environment, sustainability and transparency                  \n  as important aspects of stockholder and broader stakeholder   \n  value. Citi communicates its                                  \n  sustainability and ESG efforts to stockholders, clients and   \n  other stakeholders, including                                 \n  its achievements in the areas of environmental                \n  sustainability, climate change, net zero,                     \n  community investment and development, and human rights.       \n  Environmental and social issues have                          \n  the potential to impede corporate plans and long-term         \n  performance, which is why it is necessary                     \n  to have a sustainability-competent Board. Citi\u2019s Board must   \n  include members with experience                               \n  in the areas of climate change and finance, community         \n  development, corporate social responsibility                  \n  and other ESG issues to help Citi navigate these complex and  \n  quickly evolving issues and                                   \n  to assist management in evaluating Citi\u2019s ESG policies and    \n  programs.                                                     \n  Citi\u2019s                                                        \n  internal controls over financial reporting are designed to    \n  ensure that Citi\u2019s financial                                  \n  reporting and its financial statements are prepared in        \n  accordance with generally accepted                            \n  accounting principles. While the Board and its committees     \n  are not responsible for preparing                             \n  our financial statements, they have oversight                 \n  responsibility, including the selection of                    \n  outside independent auditors, subject to stockholder          \n  ratification, and lead audit engagement                       \n  partner. The Board must include members with direct or        \n  supervisory experience in the preparation                     \n  of financial statements, as well as finance, audit, and       \n  accounting expertise.                                         \n  Citi                                                          \n  employs approximately 240,000 people in nearly 100            \n  countries. Human capital management is                        \n  a critical capability for Citi\u2019s Board given the strategic    \n  importance of maintaining                                     \n  a skilled, motivated workforce. Citi\u2019s Board must include     \n  Directors who understand                                      \n  key issues related to human capital including training,       \n  diversity, employee benefits, compensation                    \n  programs, career trajectories, and U.S. and global labor      \n  issues. Having Directors with the                             \n  appropriate expertise to review our succession strategy and   \n  leadership pipeline for key roles                             \n  while taking into account Citi\u2019s long-term corporate          \n  strategy is paramount to managing                             \n  Citi\u2019s resources \u2014 its employees. Citi seeks out Board        \n  members who have had experience                               \n  overseeing and managing executive teams and a sizeable        \n  worldwide workforce, with an emphasis                         \n  on development of human resources.                            \n  Citi                                                          \n  provides a wide variety of services to its corporate          \n  clients, including strategic and financial                    \n  advisory services, such as mergers, acquisitions, financial   \n  restructurings, loans, foreign                                \n  exchange, cash management, underwriting and distributing      \n  equity, and debt and equity derivative                        \n  services, markets and securities services, retail structured  \n  products, liquidity management,                               \n  treasury and trade solutions and securities and fund          \n  services. With a corporate business                           \n  as extensive and complex as Citi\u2019s, it is crucial that        \n  members of the Board have the                                 \n  depth of understanding and experience necessary to guide      \n  management\u2019s conduct of these                                 \n  lines of business.                                            \n                                                                \nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                         \n  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  49  \n                                         \n                                                                \n  As                                                            \n  a company with a broad international reach, Citi\u2019s Board      \n  values the perspectives of                                    \n  Directors with international business or governmental         \n  experience or expertise in global economics.                  \n  Citi\u2019s presence in markets outside the United States is an    \n  important competitive advantage                               \n  for Citi, because it allows us to serve U.S. and foreign      \n  businesses and individual clients                             \n  whose activities span the globe.

In making recommendations to the Board, the Committee  \nconsiders the competitive positioning of the aggregate and      \nindividual components of compensation, as well as the mix of pay\nand structure versus both direct competitors and other          \ncomparable organizations. The Committee also considers the      \nunique skill set required to serve on our Board and the intense \ntime commitment associated with preparation for and attendance  \nat meetings of the Board and its committees as well as external \ncommitments, such as engagement with our stockholders and       \nregulators. Since our initial public offering in 1986, Citi has \npaid outside Directors all or a portion of their compensation in\ncommon stock to ensure that the Directors have an ownership     \ninterest in common with other stockholders.                     \n                                                                \n  Annual Cash Retainer and Deferred Stock Award                 \n  Non-employee                                                  \n  Directors receive an annual cash retainer of $75,000 and a    \n  deferred stock award valued at $150,000. The deferred stock   \n  award is generally                                            \n  granted in early January. In the event a Director retires or  \n  resigns from the Board in the year for which an award is      \n  granted before                                                \n  attaining age 72, a pro rata portion of the award is          \n  forfeited, based on the number of full or partial calendar    \n  quarters served.                                              \n  The deferred stock award generally becomes distributable on   \n  the first anniversary of the date of the grant, and           \n  Directors may elect                                           \n  to defer receipt of the award beyond that date.               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Fees for Service on Citi\u2019s Board Committees,                  \n  Citibank\u2019s Board, and other Board Service                     \n  \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A                                                         \n  Citi Director who serves as Chair of the Audit Committee,     \n  Compensation, Performance Management                          \n  and Culture Committee, Risk Management Committee, Technology  \n  Committee, or certain ad hoc                                  \n  committees is entitled to an annual $50,000 Committee Chair   \n  Fee per committee.

The Board believes this amount is appropriate  \n  in light of the                                               \n  virtually full-time nature of the Chair\u2019s responsibilities,   \n  Mr. Dugan\u2019s extensive experience and knowledge of the         \n  regulatory                                                    \n  environment, and the compensation paid for similar roles      \n  among direct competitors, including U.S. and non-U.S. banks   \n  as well as other                                              \n  high-profile global organizations. Since October of 2020,     \n  Mr. Dugan has also played an active and important role in     \n  connection with Citi\u2019s                                        \n  Transformation Program, including chairing the                \n  Transformation Oversight Committee, as Citi seeks to drive    \n  excellence in its risk and control                            \n  environment, operations, and service to clients.              \n  The components of Mr. Dugan\u2019s compensation                    \n  include a Chair Fee of $500,000 plus fees that all directors  \n  receive, which include the Retainer and Deferred Stock Award  \n  that total $225,000,                                          \n  as described above.

The Audit Committee has  \nconcluded that the fees earned by KPMG were consistent with the \nmaintenance of the external auditors\u2019 independence in the       \nconduct of its auditing functions.                              \n                                                                \nThe Audit Committee must pre-approve all services provided and  \nfees earned by Citi\u2019s independent registered public accounting  \nfirm. The Audit Committee annually considers the provision of   \naudit services and, if appropriate, pre-approves certain defined\naudit fees, audit-related fees, and tax-compliance fees with    \nspecific dollar-value limits for each category of service. The  \nAudit Committee also considers on a case-by-case basis specific \nengagements that are not otherwise pre-approved (e.g., internal \ncontrol and certain tax compliance engagements) or that exceed  \npre-approved fee amounts. On an interim basis, any proposed     \nengagement that does not fit within the definition of a pre-    \napproved service may be presented to the Chair of the Audit     \nCommittee for approval and to the full Audit Committee at its   \nnext regular meeting.                                           \n                                                                \nThe Accounting Firm Engagement Standard is the primary basis    \nupon which management ensures the independence of its           \nindependent registered public accounting firm. Administration of\nthe Standard is centralized in, and monitored by, Citi senior   \ncorporate financial management, which reports the engagements   \nearned by KPMG throughout the year to the Audit Committee. The  \nStandard also includes limitations on the hiring of KPMG        \npartners and other professionals to ensure that Citi satisfies  \napplicable auditor independence rules.                          \n                                                                \nKPMG has served as the independent registered public accounting \nfirm of Citi and its predecessors since 1969. As in prior years,\nCiti and its Audit Committee have engaged in a review of KPMG in\nconnection with the Audit Committee\u2019s consideration of whether  \nto recommend that stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG as  \nCiti\u2019s independent auditor for the following year. In that      \nreview, the Audit Committee considers both the continued        \nindependence of KPMG and whether retaining KPMG is in the best  \ninterests of Citi and its stockholders. Citi\u2019s management       \nprepares an annual assessment of KPMG for the Audit Committee   \nthat includes (i) the results of a management survey of KPMG\u2019s  \noverall performance; (ii) review of external data on audit      \nquality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on KPMG \nand its peer firms; (iii) an analysis of KPMG\u2019s known legal     \nrisks and significant proceedings that may impair KPMG\u2019s ability\nto perform Citi\u2019s annual audit; and (iv) KPMG\u2019s fees and        \nservices provided to Citi both on an absolute basis, noting, of \ncourse, that KPMG does not provide any non-audit services, other\nthan those described in the Proxy Statement, to Citi, and       \ncompared to services provided by other auditing firms to peer   \ninstitutions. In addition, KPMG reviews with the Audit Committee\nits analysis of its independence in accordance with the         \nAccounting Firm Engagement Standard and PCAOB Rule 3526. In     \nperforming its analysis, the Audit Committee considered the     \nlength of time KPMG has been Citi\u2019s independent auditor, the    \nbreadth and complexity of Citi\u2019s business and its global        \nfootprint and the resulting demands placed on its auditing firm \nin terms of expertise in Citi\u2019s businesses, the quantity and    \nquality of staff, and global reach. The Audit Committee         \nrecognized the ability of KPMG to provide both the necessary    \nexpertise to audit Citi\u2019s business and the matching global      \nfootprint to audit Citi worldwide and other factors, including  \nthe policies that KPMG follows with respect to rotation of the  \nkey audit personnel, so that there is a new partner-in-charge at\nleast every five years. Citi\u2019s Audit Committee oversees the     \nprocess for, and ultimately approves, the selection of the      \nindependent auditor\u2019s lead engagement partner at the five-year  \nmandatory rotation period. At the Audit Committee\u2019s instruction,\nKPMG selects candidates to be considered for the lead engagement\npartner role, who are then interviewed by members of Citi\u2019s     \nsenior management. After considering the candidates recommended \nby KPMG, senior management makes a recommendation to the Audit  \nCommittee regarding the new lead engagement partner. After      \ndiscussing the qualifications of the proposed lead engagement   \npartner with the current lead engagement partner and senior     \nleadership of KPMG, the members of the Audit Committee,         \nindividually and/ or as a group, interview the leading          \ncandidate. The Audit Committee then considers the appointment   \nand votes as an Audit Committee on the selection. Based on the  \nresults of its review this year, the Audit Committee concluded  \nthat KPMG is independent and that it is in the best interests of\nCiti and its investors to appoint KPMG to serve as Citi\u2019s       \nindependent registered accounting firm for 2023.                \n                                                                \n  Board                                                         \n  Recommendation                                                \n  The                                                           \n  Board recommends a vote FOR ratification of KPMG as Citi\u2019s    \n  independent registered public accounting firm for 2023.       \n                                                                \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n      \n  70  \n      \nProposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our 2022 Executive\nCompensation\n\nWe are seeking a nonbinding, advisory vote approving\nthe compensation of our named executive officers disclosed in\nthis Proxy Statement, as required by Section 14A and Rule\n14a-21(a) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.

In making\nits\ndecision, the Compensation Committee also took into account the\ncompetitive market rate of pay among our core peers, Citi\u2019s\noperational\nperformance as described throughout this Proxy Statement, and\nour disappointing short-term shareholder returns.\n                                                                \n  \u25cf  2022 was Ms. Fraser\u2019s first full calendar year as our      \n     CEO.                                                       \n     Ms. Fraser established a clear set of strategic            \n     priorities for Citi to increase shareholder value over     \n  \u25cf  time, as described above. Execution in respect of these    \n     priorities is expected to generate improved returns over   \n     the medium-term.                                           \n  \u25cf  Ms. Fraser\u2019s leadership through the business challenges    \n     posed by the war in Ukraine was exemplary.                 \n     In order to further align Ms. Fraser\u2019s compensation with   \n     shareholder interests, the Compensation Committee          \n     determined that the components of her 2022 incentive       \n     compensation would be further weighted toward stock-based  \n  \u25cf  compensation. Specifically, the Compensation Committee     \n     increased the portion of her 2022 incentive compensation   \n     that was delivered in the form of deferred stock awards    \n     from 20% to 35% and reduced the portion of her 2022        \n     incentive compensation that was paid in cash from 30% to   \n     15%.                                                       \n     Ms. Fraser\u2019s compensation is aligned with shareholder      \n     interests through various features of our compensation     \n     program that tie the amount of compensation to our stock   \n     price and financial metrics. The disclosure on             \n     page 107 concerning pay versus performance, as required    \n     by new SEC disclosure rules, provides additional           \n     information concerning that alignment. The stockholder     \n  \u25cf  alignment of our compensation program is illustrated by    \n     the fact, as described on page 107, that while Ms.         \n     Fraser\u2019s total compensation as reflected in the Summary    \n     Compensation Table on page 100 was approximately $20.5     \n     million in 2021, the amount actually paid to Ms. Fraser,   \n     determined pursuant to the SEC\u2019s new pay versus            \n     performance disclosure rules was approximately $16         \n     million.                                                   \n     One of the features that aligns Ms. Fraser\u2019s compensation  \n     to shareholder interests is our use of PSUs as part of     \n     incentive compensation. As described below, the PSUs that  \n  \u25cf  were granted to Ms. Fraser for 2019, constituting 30% of   \n     her total 2019 incentive compensation, were cancelled      \n     without payment because performance did not meet minimum   \n     financial performance thresholds.                          \n                                                                \nTransformation Bonus Program\nTo incentivize effective execution in connection\nwith the Consent Order programs and to drive change in Citi\u2019s\nrisk and control environment and culture, in August 2021 the\nCompensation\nCommittee approved the Transformation Bonus Program. A\ndescription of the Transformation Bonus Program was included in\nour 2022 Proxy\nStatement. Additional information related to the Transformation\nBonus program can be found in the supplemental solicitation\nmaterials\nCiti filed with the SEC in 2022, which can be accessed at\nwww.citigroup.com. Ms. Fraser is not eligible to participate in\nthe Transformation\nBonus Program. All other members of our EMT at the time the\nprogram was adopted, as well as approximately 250 other\nemployees who are\ndeemed to be critical to execution in connection with the\nConsent Order programs, are eligible to participate in the\nTransformation Bonus\nProgram.\n\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  PROPOSAL                                                      \n  3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR\u00a02022 EXECUTIVE            73  \n  COMPENSATION                                                  \n                                                                \nFollowing the completion of the first\nperformance measurement period under the Transformation Bonus\nProgram, the Compensation Committee determined that the\nPerformance\nAchievement Percentage for that period would be 94%, reflecting\nthe Compensation Committee\u2019s assessment of performance\nrelative to the preset targets established for that program.\nThose targets include the submission by Citi to\nour regulators of plans to remediate the issues addressed by the\nConsent Orders. Citi provides both regulators on an ongoing\nbasis\ninformation regarding its plans and progress and continues to\nwork constructively with the regulators to reflect their\nfeedback on\nremediation efforts. The Citi Board of Directors has determined\nthat our plans are responsive to our objectives and that we\ncontinue\nto make progress on our execution. Additional information\nconcerning the Program is on pages 90 to 92.\nOther Considerations\nIn making its determinations, the Compensation Committee\nconsidered absolute and relative total shareholder returns for\n2022, including the various elements of Citi\u2019s executive\ncompensation\nprogram that tie compensation to total shareholder returns. The\nCompensation Committee also took into account market and\nequitable levels\nof pay for comparable positions at peer institutions.\n\nCiti has since 2013 delivered a portion of incentive\ncompensation for our EMT in the form of PSUs. The Compensation\nCommittee determined not to make any payments in respect of PSUs\ngranted\nas part of our 2019 incentive compensation awards, on the basis\nthat performance during the three-year performance period for\nthose awards,\nfrom 2020 through 2022, did not meet threshold achievement\nlevels.\n\nFor 2022, we expanded the use of PSUs in our compensation\nprogram, so that members of our Global Operating Team also\nreceive PSUs in addition to deferred stock and immediate cash\nawards where\npermitted by local law.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  74  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR 2022 EXECUTIVE   \n      COMPENSATION                                              \n                                                                \nOur Compensation Philosophy\n\nOur Compensation Philosophy is designed to encourage\nprudent risk-taking and management of controls while attracting\nthe world-class talent necessary for our success.

For the one-, three- and five-year periods\nending with 2022 our total shareholder returns have been -22.1%,\n-36.8%\nand -28.7%, respectively. Our 2022 financial performance\nhighlights included:\n                                                                \n     Citi\u2019s revenues increased 5% versus the prior year,        \n     including net gains on sales of Citi\u2019s Philippines and     \n     Thailand consumer banking businesses versus a loss on      \n  \u25cf  sale of Citi\u2019s Australia consumer banking business in the  \n     prior year. Excluding these divestiture-related impacts,   \n     revenues increased 3%, driven by higher net interest       \n     income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenues.   \n     Citi\u2019s expenses increased 6% versus the prior year,        \n     including divestiture-related impacts in both the current  \n     and prior years. Excluding these divestiture-related       \n     impacts, expenses increased 8%, driven by continued        \n  \u25cf  investments in Citi\u2019s transformation, business-led         \n     investments and volume-related expenses, as well as other  \n     risk and control investments and inflation, all partially  \n     offset by productivity savings, the impact of foreign      \n     exchange translation and the expense reduction from the    \n     closure of five exit markets.                              \n     Citi\u2019s cost of credit was $5.2 billion, versus $(3.8)      \n     billion in the prior year, largely reflecting a net build  \n     of $1.2 billion in the allowance for credit losses on      \n  \u25cf  loans and unfunded lending commitments, primarily due to   \n     consumer loan growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic  \n     assumptions, compared to a net ACL release of $8.8         \n     billion in the prior year.                                 \n  \u25cf  Citi returned $7.3 billion to common shareholders in the   \n     form of dividends and share repurchases.                   \n     Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio           \n     increased to 13.0% as of December 31, 2022, compared to    \n     12.2% as of December 31, 2021 (for additional              \n  \u25cf  information, see \u201cCapital Resources\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022        \n     Annual Report on Form 10-K).

In making\ncompensation determinations,\nour Compensation Committee takes into account additional risk\nand control metrics for each individual named executive officer,\nas described\nbelow on pages 81 to 86.\n                                      \n  ANNUAL                              \n  INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS  \n                                      \nOur compensation programs are designed in accordance\nwith our responsibility to assume only risks that are prudent\nand to effectively manage those risks to protect the franchise.\nOur programs\nreinforce and are aligned with our risk governance framework.\n\nOur Compensation Philosophy requires us to consider\nrisk management when making discretionary incentive compensation\nawards. We adjust the amount of compensation upwards to\nrecognize exemplary\nbehaviors and downwards to disincentivize employees from taking\ninappropriate risks.\n\nOur incentive compensation awards have the following\nimportant elements:\n                                                                \n     Our executive compensation framework takes risk and        \n  \u25cf  control management into account in several                 \n     ways, including:                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u25cf  using financial metrics that reflect risk as an element    \n     of each executive\u2019s financial goals                        \n     evaluating risk management performance, including          \n  \u25cf  effectiveness of the control environment, as part of the   \n     performance assessment                                     \n  \u25cf  providing for forfeiture of the deferred portion of        \n     incentive awards based on adverse risk outcomes            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     We systematically identify employees who, individually or  \n     as part of a group, have\u00a0authorities or responsibilities   \n     that may subject the firm to material risks. Through a     \n     systematic annual process, we identify the material risks  \n     to the firm and then identify employees with influence     \n  \u25cf  over those risks.

We launched our Transformation initiative in\n2020 to make real and sustainable changes to strengthen our risk\nand control\nenvironment and modernize our operating model.\n\nEvery member of our leadership team is involved\nin the Transformation and plays a key, hands-on role in its\nimplementation. We have assembled an extraordinary team of top\ntalent, consisting\nof long-tenured colleagues and new hires as appropriate, from\nacross multiple differences and areas of expertise and\nexperience, with\nrepresentatives from the businesses and global functions, to\nlead six different Transformation programs. We are putting our\nbest talent\ninto this effort and have a detailed, integrated approach to\naddress the needs of our clients, investors and regulators.\n\nIn addition, we made meaningful progress on our\nculture refresh by launching Citi\u2019s New Way, a three-year\nresearch-based program to integrate small but meaningful\nbehavioral habits\ndesigned to drive executional excellence. To date, nearly 22,000\ncolleagues have attended workshops to learn these habits, with\n92% of\nattendees feeling more empowered to take ownership and deliver\non their team\u2019s goals. Our senior leaders in this effort put us\non\nthe right path and laid a strong foundation for the hard work\nthat lies ahead.\n\nSpecifically, our 2022 performance in respect\nof our Transformation would most appropriately be assessed\nagainst the criteria we established in 2021 under our\nTransformation\nBonus Program. Following the completion of the first performance\nmeasurement period under the Transformation\nBonus Program, the Compensation Committee determined that the\nPerformance Achievement Percentage for that period would be 94%,\nreflecting the Compensation Committee\u2019s assessment of\nperformance relative to the preset targets established for that\ntranche\nunder the Program. Those targets include the submission by Citi\nto our regulators of plans to remediate the issues addressed by\nthe\nConsent Orders. Citi provides both regulators on an ongoing\nbasis information regarding its plans and progress and continues\nto work\nconstructively with the regulators to reflect their feedback on\nremediation efforts. The Citi Board of Directors has determined\nthat\nour plans are responsive to our objectives and that we continue\nto make progress on our execution. Additional information\nconcerning\nthe Program is on pages 90 to 92.\n\nLeadership Pillar\n\nThe primary Leadership highlights for Citi in 2022\narose from the need to begin to execute on our strategic refresh\nand cultural transformation.\n             \n  STRATEGIC  \n  REFRESH    \n             \nOne of our major goals for 2022 was to put in place\na strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our\nshareholders and to get that plan swiftly off the ground. We\nmade significant\nprogress during 2022 towards that end. We simplified the firm,\nclosing sales of our consumer businesses in five markets,\nincluding three\nin the fourth quarter.\n\nSpecifically, during 2022, we:\n                                                                \n     Closed sales of consumer businesses in Australia, the      \n  \u25cf  Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Bahrain, including     \n     three in the fourth quarter of 2022.                       \n     Made substantial progress in winding down our consumer     \n  \u25cf  business in Korea, reducing our overall exposure in        \n     Russia, and we announced the wind down of our consumer     \n     business in China.                                         \n  \u25cf  Signed four additional consumer markets sales in 2022 and  \n     are working toward closing them in 2023.                   \n                                                                \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n      PROPOSAL                                                  \n  78  3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR\u00a02022 EXECUTIVE            \n      COMPENSATION                                              \n                                                                \nIn addition, our focus is now on five interconnected\nbusinesses \u2013 Services, Markets, Banking, Global Wealth\nManagement and U.S. Personal Banking. The interconnectivity of\nthese businesses\nwill not only benefit our clients, but will support our shift to\na business services orientation. This orientation to operating\nwith\ncommon standards, platforms, controls and processes for similar\nactivities will be facilitated by the increased focus and\nconnectivity\nwe now have across our business, and is expected to \u2013 in turn \u2013\nlead to a reduction in risk over time.\n\nWe have also revised our management financial reporting\nstructure to align with our strategy refresh and to enable\ninvestors and others to better understand the performance and\nvalue of our\nbusinesses. Specifically, we:\n                                                                \n     Created a Personal Banking and Wealth Management business  \n     segment. It consists of two distinct reporting units:      \n  \u25cf  U.S. Personal Banking businesses and a Global Wealth       \n     Management business, which includes our private banking    \n     business.                                                  \n     With respect to our Institutional Clients Group, we        \n     created and began reporting under three units: Services,   \n     Banking and Markets. Services includes Treasury and Trade  \n  \u25cf  Solutions (TTS) and Securities Services, reflecting the    \n     importance of these businesses to our future. These        \n     businesses are foundational to Citi given their global     \n     footprint and full suite of product offerings.             \n     We also created a Legacy Franchises segment, consisting    \n     of all the businesses we intend to exit, including our     \n  \u25cf  remaining legacy Holdings assets. We established a         \n     dedicated team to manage this segment, enabling the        \n     management teams leading our other segments to focus on    \n     executing Citi\u2019s other strategic priorities.               \n                                                                \nIn addition to putting in place a strategic plan,\nour goal for 2022 was to assemble the talent, internally and\nfrom outside our firm, necessary to execute on our strategic\npriorities.\nThose priorities included strengthening our risk and control\nenvironment as described on page 76. In 2022, we brought in very\nstrong talent,\nwhile meeting our representation goals. We added over 17,000\ndirect staff to our risk and control, program management and\noperations and\ntechnology teams.\n\nIdentifying, onboarding, integrating and retaining\nthe talent we need to get this work done \u2013 against the backdrop\nof an historically hot talent market and the ongoing\nramifications\nof the pandemic \u2013 was harder and more time consuming than\nanticipated. Yet in the face of these challenges, our teams\nattracted\nhigh caliber talent externally and moved internal talent into\ncritical roles. We endeavored to strike the right balance\nbetween fresh\nperspectives and people who know our firm. The new joiners to\nCiti included a material number of new, top tier leaders from\nour best peers\nacross several layers of the organization.\n                  \n  CULTURAL        \n  TRANSFORMATION  \n                  \nCiti\u2019s Transformation is ultimately\ndelivered by our people and its success demands a culture of\nexcellence and accountability. Our approach to executing on our\nculture\nchange started with management, under the direct oversight of\nthe Citi Board of Directors, laying out the key elements of the\nculture that needed to change and setting the tone from the top\nwith an emphasis on our three Leadership Principles \u2013 we take\nownership, we deliver with pride, and we succeed together. We\nhave embedded these principles into our performance management\nsystem,\nestablishing a new bar for risk and controls and reinforcing it\nwith clear and transparent expectations and consequences so that\nthere is no doubt over accountability for risk and controls,\noperations or client delivery.\n\nOur work to evolve our culture entails considerable\ninvestment in training of the entire firm in foundational\nprinciples. We have begun to see a mind shift across Citi that\nwe are nurturing\nthrough a behavioral change campaign launched in 2022, Citi\u2019s\nNew Way. This campaign introduces new working habits that will\nchange\nthe fundamentals of how things get done at Citi. We started by\nfocusing on promoting habits that encourage ownership through\nleadership\nexamples, training and communication. These difficult but\nnecessary changes are critical because they will allow us to\nbecome more adept\nat identifying and escalating the issues that must be addressed\nat the firm level.\n\nIn addition, we are adding far more rigor and\nurgency around the leadership and transformation of our firm.\nMs. Fraser has brought more of Citi\u2019s business leaders into the\nfirmwide management conversation, so they are involved in\nrunning the whole firm, including our Transformation, as\nevidenced by the\nformation of our Global\n\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  PROPOSAL                                                      \n  3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR\u00a02022 EXECUTIVE            79  \n  COMPENSATION                                                  \n                                                                \nOperating Team. We have implemented firmwide processes to\naccelerate and improve the quality of decision\nmaking. Those enhanced processes include monitoring our\ninvestments and execution of our strategy. We have also\nsimplified a range\nof approval processes, from hiring to new product initiatives.\n\nWe recognize that changing our culture is also a\nmulti-year effort. Our employee survey results confirm that the\nchange we need is clearly afoot but we know it will take a few\nmore years\nto permeate the organization more fully and permanently. As this\nimportant work continues, we will accumulate data on employee\nengagement,\nadoption of habits, and changes to risk and control related\nbehaviors, allowing us over time to review the ultimate impact\non outcomes.\nWe will also use this data to identify and learn from parts of\nthe organization with a strong culture of excellence as well as\nto intervene\nwhere we spot emerging behavioral risk.\n\nClient and Franchise Pillar\n\nThe success of our client and franchise efforts\ndepends on a long-term, firmwide approach, and we engaged in\nmany separate projects in 2022, both large and small, in support\nof our goals.\nOverall, we successfully navigated through the macro and\ngeopolitical shocks that defined the year and supported our\nclients and communities\nwith excellence and compassion.\n\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Proxy Statement described our\nCommunity Investment and Development teams, our Support of Local\nCommunity efforts, our Sustainable Finance Commitment and our\nAction\nfor Racial Equity program. This year, we highlight our plan to\nreach net zero emissions by 2050, the expansion of our impact\ninvesting,\nand the audit of our racial equity efforts in the U.S. These\nwere considered by the Compensation Committee as important\nexamples of our\nefforts to solidify client relationships and strengthen our\nfranchise during 2022.\n                  \n  NET             \n  ZERO EMISSIONS  \n                  \nIdentifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks and\nopportunities remains a top business priority for Citi, as\nevidenced by Ms. Fraser\u2019s announcement in 2021 of Citi\u2019s\ncommitment to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 and net zero\noperations by 2030.\n\nOver the past 20 years, Citi has progressively built our\nunderstanding of climate-related risks and opportunities, and\nupdated our climate governance structure. We believe there is a\nbusiness opportunity in helping our clients transition to net\nzero. We have provided transparency on our progress in Citi\u2019s\n2022 TCFD Report.\n\nWe are beginning to work with our clients to help them develop\ncredible transition plans and to finance their efforts to\ndecarbonize. Citi is encouraging a responsible and orderly\nenergy transition to ensure that the world\u2019s energy needs\ncontinue to be met while also supporting decarbonization.\n\nAs part of our client engagement approach, we will encourage the\nresponsible retirement of carbon-intensive assets where feasible\nrather than divestment. We are cognizant that large-scale, rapid\ndivestment could result in an abrupt and disorderly transition\nto a low-carbon economy, creating economic and social upheaval\non a global scale. For example, certain carbon-intensive\ncompanies may play critical roles in channeling the necessary\ncapital expenditures and providing the raw materials to support\nnew climate technologies or may provide necessary baseload power\nfor developing economies.\n             \n  IMPACT     \n  INVESTING  \n             \nThrough our $500 million Impact Fund, we are using\nour own capital to make equity investments in \u201cdouble bottom\nline\u201d U.S.-based private sector companies that are applying\ninnovative\nsolutions to help address some of society\u2019s most pressing\nchallenges.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n      PROPOSAL                                                  \n  80  3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR\u00a02022 EXECUTIVE            \n      COMPENSATION                                              \n                                                                \nWe typically coinvest alongside other investors\nin the venture capital ecosystem, making equity capital\ncommitments ranging from $250,000 to $10 million across the seed\nto pre-IPO stages.\nInvestments are primarily made in companies that have\ndemonstrated proof of concept, secured prior rounds of funding\nand exhibited the\npotential for scale. We primarily, but not exclusively, invest\nin four verticals: Future of Work, Climate Solutions, Financial\nInclusion,\nand Social Infrastructure, with a focus on Housing,\nTransportation and Healthcare.\n\nWe actively seek opportunities to invest in businesses\nthat are led or owned by women and people of color to help\ncombat the gender and race gaps that exist in the venture\ncapital-funded startup\necosystem. As part of this commitment, early-stage seed\ninvestments are primarily allocated to businesses that are led\nor owned by women\nand people of color.\n\nAdditionally, as part of Citi and the Citi Foundation\u2019s\n$1 billion+ Action for Racial Equity (ARE) initiative, the Citi\nImpact Fund\u2019s Black Entrepreneurs Investment Initiative \u2013\na $50 million capital commitment from Citi to help reduce the\nracial wealth gap by creating equitable access to venture\ncapital funding\nfor Black founders \u2013 has made early-stage equity investments in\ntech-enabled ventures led by Black founders.\n          \n  RACIAL  \n  EQUITY  \n          \nIn the aftermath of the horrific murder of George\nFloyd, we tried to channel our grief into action. By September\n2020, we had marshalled resources across the firm to support\nmore than\n$1 billion in initiatives to help close the racial wealth gap.\nWhile ARE was ambitious in terms of our firm\u2019s footprint and\nresources,\nwe also recognize how much investment and change is required\nacross all corners of our society to help address the racial\nwealth gap.\n\nIn this context, we made delivering on our commitments\na business imperative that reflects the type of company we\naspire to be for our employees and the communities we serve.\nMeasurement and\ntransparency are critical to ensuring we\u2019re holding ourselves\naccountable. In October 2021, after consultation with investors,\nwe\ntook an important step by committing to conduct an independent\nthird-party racial equity audit. The audit assessed the design\nand implementation\nof ARE. We released the results of that audit in 2022 and it is\navailable\nat www.citigroup.com.\n\nThe following are some of the key takeaways:\n                                                                \n     ARE\u2019s design successfully leveraged Citi\u2019s expertise,      \n  \u25cf  network of business partners, and resources to address     \n     some of the key factors contributing to the racial wealth  \n     gap.                                                       \n     While we have exceeded our aggregate financial commitment  \n     of $1.1 billion in strategic investments and initiatives,  \n  \u25cf  we have not yet accomplished every commitment announced    \n     in September 2020, though we have made progress toward     \n     many of them two years into our three-year commitment.     \n     The audit highlights a number of areas where Citi has      \n     increased access to key resources for communities of       \n     color.

For additional information about the Consent\nOrders, see \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24,\n2023, and Citi\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC\non\nOctober 7, 2020.\n\nColleagues at all levels are expected to play an\nactive role in achieving these standards, and senior leaders are\naccountable for driving progress. To incentivize effective\nexecution\nin connection with the Consent Order programs and to drive\nchange in Citi\u2019s risk and control environment and culture, in\nAugust\n2021 the Compensation Committee approved the Transformation\nBonus Program. A description of the Transformation Bonus Program\nwas included\nin our 2022 Proxy Statement. Additional information related to\nthe Transformation Bonus program can be found in the\nsupplemental solicitation\nmaterials filed by us in 2022 with the SEC, which can be\naccessed on our public website.\n\nMs. Fraser is not eligible to participate in the\nTransformation Bonus Program. All other members of our EMT at\nthe time the Program was adopted, as well as approximately 250\nother employees\nwho are deemed to be critical to execution in connection with\nthe Consent Order programs, are eligible to participate in the\nTransformation\nBonus Program.\n\nPerformance under our Transformation\nBonus Program is based on the collective achievement of metrics\nin various categories, rather than on individual performance, in\norder\nto foster a unified, collective focus on achieving key\nTransformation goals and ensure consistent leadership throughout\nthe multi-year\neffort. Central to the design of the Program was the recognition\nthat our ability to achieve the objectives of our Transformation\nrequires\ncollective effort over a multi-year period. Accordingly,\nparticipants in the Program are collectively evaluated against\noutcomes in order\nto foster a culture of shared accountability.\n\nPerformance is measured, and the bonus, if any,\npayable pursuant to the Program is paid in three tranches, each\nrepresenting a separate performance period. Specific goals and\nrelated\nmetrics are established for each of the three tranches. The\nmaximum portion of the bonus payable for each tranche is: 25%\nfor the first\ntranche, 25% for the second tranche and 50% for the third\ntranche.\n\nShortly before each designated payment date,\nan assessment is made by the Compensation Committee to determine\nwhat portion \u2013 if any \u2013 of the relevant tranche is\ncollectively earned based on performance relative to specific\npreset targets for the applicable performance\nperiod. The portion to be paid out for each tranche will be\napplied to all participants in the Program on a consistent\nbasis. For\nexample, while a maximum of 25 percent of the award can be\nearned for the first tranche, if the Committee determines, based\non the\nrelevant criteria, that collective performance merits only a 15\npercent payout, then each participant will only be paid 15\npercent\nfor that tranche (assuming they satisfy all other conditions for\nentitlement to be paid).\n\nThe first and second tranches are only\nimpacted by performance relative to preset targets. Each\nconstitutes a maximum of 25 percent of the award. The third\ntranche, which\nconstitutes a maximum of 50 percent of the award, is affected by\nboth performance relative to preset targets and stock\nperformance.\nFor this third tranche, once performance is accounted for and\nthe base payout is determined to be either the maximum 50\npercent or\nsome lower percentage as described above, the payout is further\nadjusted based on stock performance. That is, the payout amount\nis\nfurther adjusted downward or upward as if that payout had been\ninvested in Citi common stock, from the date of grant of each\naward\nthrough the payment date for the third tranche, taking into\naccount stock price changes and the sum of dividends paid\n(without\ninterest or assumed reinvestment), consistent with our customary\napproach for equity-based compensation. The starting value for\nthis\ncalculation is $70.37, the average closing price of our stock\nfrom October 25-29, 2021, the five-day period before awards were\ngranted to participants. The ending value for this calculation\nwill be the five-day average of closing prices for the stock for\nthe\nperiod ending\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                     \n  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR 2022  91  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                             \n                                                     \non February 19, 2025, the scheduled payment date for the\nthird tranche. Stock performance during this period is the only\nmeans by which the award value can be increased above the target\naward value for the third tranche; the value of the award could\nalso decrease if stock performance decreases.\n\nParticipants must continue to be actively employed\nby Citi at the payment date to receive a payment. Payments are\nfurther subject to all Program conditions, including\ndemonstrable leadership\nin all job specific aspects of the Transformation, a\nsatisfactory Risk and Control Pillar performance rating under\nour normal annual\nincentive assessment process, and the rules of our\nAccountability Framework. Payments are also subject to\ncancellation and clawback provisions\nas described on page 95.\n\nThere is no opportunity to make up for reductions\nto earlier tranches through exceptional performance for later\ntranches. In approving the Transformation Bonus Program, the\nCompensation\nCommittee did not intend that it would be a replacement,\nsubstitution or make-up for any other compensation amount, nor\ndoes the Committee\nexpect to make other special awards related to the\nTransformation in the future.\n\nTranche 1 Payout Determination\n\nThe Citigroup and Citibank Boards of Directors each\nformed a Transformation Oversight Committee, an ad hoc committee\nof each Board, to provide oversight of management\u2019s remediation\nefforts under the Consent Orders. The primary focus for the\nfirst part of our remediation efforts involved the development\nof comprehensive\nplans to remediate our regulatory issues and submission of those\nplans to our regulators.\n\nFollowing the completion of the first\nperformance measurement period under the Transformation Bonus\nProgram, the Compensation Committee determined that the\nPerformance\nAchievement Percentage for that period would be 94%, reflecting\nthe Compensation Committee\u2019s assessment of performance\nrelative to the predetermined targets set for that tranche under\nthe Program. The targets established for the first performance\nperiod included Citi\u2019s submission to our regulators of plans to\nremediate the issues addressed by the Consent Orders, and\nobjectively measurable targets to assess performance on\nTransformation milestones.\n                                                                \n     Submission of remediation plans to the FRB and the OCC:    \n     Citi provides both regulators on an ongoing                \n     basis information regarding its plans and progress and     \n     continues to work constructively with the regulators to    \n  \u2022  reflect their feedback                                     \n     on remediation efforts. The Citi Board of Directors has    \n     determined that our plans are responsive to our            \n     objectives and that we continue                            \n     to make progress on our execution.                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Transformation Milestones: The Compensation Committee\u2019s    \n  \u2022  assessment included management\u2019s                           \n     achievement relative to targets on each of the following   \n     metric categories during the first performance period:     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  \u2022  Actions to reduce risk on our high-priority items in the   \n     near term                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Plan milestone execution, which includes the percentage    \n     of milestones that management has completed on             \n  \u2022  time for submission to our Internal Audit function for     \n     validation; the percentage of milestones that are at       \n     risk; and the percentage of                                \n     milestones that have not been completed on time            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     Execution quality, which is the percentage of milestones   \n  \u2022  that our Internal Audit function has reviewed              \n     and deemed to be complete                                  \n                                                                \nThe Compensation Committee recognized that management\nperformed above 90% achievement relative to targets on each\nmetric category during the first performance period, with the\nexception of\none (the percentage of milestones that are at risk for not being\ncompleted on time) for which we fell three percentage points\nshort of\ntarget.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  92  Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve our 2022 Executive   \n      Compensation                                              \n                                                                \nTranche 2 Performance Metrics\n\nThe Committee has determined that the metric\ncategories for the second tranche of the program, covering the\ncalendar year 2023 performance period, are:\n                                                                \n  \u2022  Execution of specific actions management must take during  \n     Phase 2 of our remediation plan                            \n     Execution quality, which is the percentage of milestones   \n  \u2022  reviewed by Citi\u2019s Internal Audit function that it deems   \n     to be complete                                             \n     Culture                                                    \n     change, which is based on a broad-based employee survey    \n  \u2022  that is designed to measure cultural alignment with our    \n     Leadership                                                 \n     Principles as described on pages 77 and 78                 \n                                                                \nThe Committee intends to set specific objective targets in\nrespect of performance metrics within those categories early in\n2023.\nCompensation Process and Governance\n\nOur Annual Compensation Process\n\nThe following summarizes the principal elements\nof our process for setting incentive compensation for our named\nexecutive officers.\n\nWe adopted our compensation accountability and rationale\ntool (CART) in 2020 as a means for administering our new\ncompensation principles and practices. CART is an integral part\nof our compensation\nframework. CART is a process tool that resulted in significantly\nincreased transparency, discipline and thoughtfulness with\nrespect to\nthe impact of risk and control performance on compensation\ndecisions. While CART requires a notably disciplined approach to\nyear-end performance\nassessment, its most important feature is that it requires\nmanagers to provide performance details across each of the four\nCART pillars\n\u2013 Risk and Control, Financial, Client and Franchise, and\nLeadership \u2013 to support compensation decisions.\n\nCART creates a comprehensive record evidencing how\nrisk was considered in compensation decisions. This practice\nenables us to systematically hold each senior manager\naccountable in a disciplined\nway for management of risk and controls and for determining\ncompensation.\n\nEach named executive officer\u2019s total incentive\naward is based on our overall achievements, individual executive\nperformance against applicable goals and a market benchmarking\nprocess.\nMetrics and goals for each named executive officer\u2019s total\nincentive award are contained in the executive\u2019s scorecard. A\nmarket\nbenchmarking process, with market rates of pay adjusted to\nreflect each named executive officer\u2019s experience and the scope\nof his\nor her role is the starting point. In addition, written\nnarrative assessments for each of the four CART pillars are\ncompleted for each\nnamed executive officer. The Compensation Committee completes\nthis assessment for our CEO and contributes to the assessments\nfor our other\nexecutive officers. These factors, considered together, form the\nbasis for the Compensation Committee\u2019s determination of\nincentive\ncompensation amounts.\n\nUnder our compensation framework, our Compensation\nCommittee uses a five-step process when making final\ndeterminations regarding named executive officer incentive\ncompensation. The steps\nare illustrated in the following graphic and summarized\nimmediately below the graphic.\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                     \n  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR 2022  93  \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                             \n                                                     \n                                                                \n  Step 1 \u2013 Goal Setting                                         \n  for Scorecards                                                \n  \u2022\u00a0\u00a0The                                                        \n  Compensation Committee approves scorecard goals for each      \n  named executive officer early in the annual compensation      \n  cycle.

The Committee considers named executive officer\ncompensation in the context of pay levels and performance at a\n13-member peer group and a smaller core peer group consisting of\nfive\nU.S.-based global banks with lines of business and scale similar\nto ours.\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with input from its\nindependent compensation consultant, established our\ncompensation peer group. The Compensation Committee evaluates\nthe compensation peer\ngroup on an annual basis to ensure that the group continues to\nbe appropriate. The Compensation Committee continues to believe\nthat a\nU.S.-based peer group reflects the relevant market for executive\ntalent and the relevant regulatory environment for our executive\ncompensation.\n\nWe chose the peers because they operate in one or\nmore lines of business that are similar to ours and compete in\nsimilar labor markets. In selecting the compensation peer group,\nthe Compensation\nCommittee uses size-based metrics as primary screening criteria\namong financial services firms. Citigroup\u2019s size relative to its\nfull peer group is generally near or above the 75th percentile\nbut is closer to median when compared to its core peers. Citi\u2019s\nbusiness\nis relatively complex compared to peers because of the global\nscope and depth of its business.\n                                                                \n                      2022 COMPENSATION                         \n                      PEER GROUP                                \n  AIG (AIG)           Goldman Sachs (GS)    Prudential (PRU)    \n  American Express    JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  \n  (AXP)                                                         \n  Bank of America     MetLife (MET)         Wells Fargo (WFC)   \n  (BAC)                                                         \n  BNY Mellon (BK)     Morgan Stanley (MS)                       \n  Capital One (COF)   PNC (PNC)                                 \n                                                                \nIn evaluating the market for named executive officer\ncompensation, the Compensation Committee focuses primarily on\ncompensation for comparable roles at the U.S.-based global banks\nwith lines\nof business and scale similar to ours: Bank of America, Goldman\nSachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

Ms.\nFraser and\nMessrs. Selvakesari and Babej have never been eligible to\nparticipate in a defined benefit pension plan under the terms of\nCiti\u2019s\nbroad-based retirement programs in effect in their employment\ncountries; they have participated only in defined contribution\nretirement\nplans since the commencement of their employment at Citi.\n\nThe following describes the pension plans listed\nin the 2022 Pension Benefits Table.\n\nThe Citigroup Pension Plan. The purpose of\nthis broad-based, tax-qualified retirement plan is to provide\nretirement income on a tax-deferred basis to all eligible U.S.\nemployees.\nEffective December 31, 2006, The Citigroup Pension Plan was\nclosed to new members and generally ceased benefit accruals\neffective December\n31, 2007. Mr. Mason is eligible for benefits under this plan.\nTheir entire benefits are cash balance benefits.\n\nThe Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance benefit\nis expressed as a hypothetical account balance. Prior to January\n1, 2008, the plan generally provided for the annual accrual of\nbenefit\ncredits for most of the covered population, including the\ncovered named executive officers, at a rate between 1.5% and 6%\nof eligible\ncompensation; the benefit credit rate increased with age and\nservice. Eligible compensation generally included base salary\nand incentive\nawards, but excluded compensation payable after termination of\nemployment, certain non-recurring payments, and other benefits.\nAnnual\neligible compensation was limited by the Internal Revenue Code\nto $225,000 for 2007 (the final year of cash balance benefit\naccrual).\nInterest credits continue to be applied annually to each\nparticipant\u2019s account balance; these credits are based on the\nyield on\n30-year Treasury bonds (as published by the Internal Revenue\nService).\n\nBenefits under The Citigroup Pension Plan are payable\nin annuity form or in other optional forms, including a lump\nsum, upon termination of employment. The Citigroup Pension\nPlan\u2019s normal\nretirement age is 65. The portion of an eligible participant\u2019s\nbenefit determined under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula\nmay\nbe paid upon early retirement, which is defined for this purpose\nas the first day of the month after the later of the\nparticipant\u2019s\n55th birthday or the date on which the participant completes a\nyear of service (as defined in the plan).\n\nThe Retirement Plan for Specified Non-United States\nInternational Staff of Citibank, N.A. and Participating\nCompanies (International Staff Plan).The International Staff\nPlan\nis an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that was\noffered to a select group of management or highly compensated\nemployees.\nThe International Staff Plan provided a retirement benefit to\ninternationally mobile staff participating in the Citi\nExpatriate Program\nwho, due to their mobile status, were ineligible for any other\nCiti defined benefit retirement plan. Benefits mirrored the\nCitibank Retirement\nPlan and, after 1999, The Citigroup Pension Plan. The\nInternational Staff Plan closed to new members and generally\nceased benefit accruals\neffective December 31, 2007, like The Citigroup Pension Plan.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n       Proposal                                                 \n  106  3: Advisory Vote to Approve Our\u00a02022 Executive           \n       Compensation                                             \n                                                                \nMr. Ybarra accrued benefits under the International\nStaff Plan from 1994 through 2007. From 1994 through 1999, Mr.\nYbarra accrued an International Staff Plan benefit determined\nusing the\nCitibank Retirement Plan formula described above, and from 2000\nthrough 2007, Mr. Ybarra accrued an International Staff Plan\nbenefit determined\nusing The Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance benefit formula\npreviously described. Limits on eligible compensation and\nbenefits imposed\nby the Internal Revenue Code on tax-qualified retirement plans\ngenerally did not apply to International Staff Plan benefit\naccruals because\nthe International Staff Plan is nonqualified; however, the\nInternational Staff Plan was amended over time to include\ncertain limits. Effective\nJanuary 1, 2000, eligible compensation under the International\nStaff Plan was limited to $500,000, and effective January 1,\n2002, the\nlimit on eligible compensation imposed by the Internal Revenue\nCode applied to International Staff Plan benefit accruals.\n\nMr. Ybarra is eligible for early retirement under\nthe Citibank Retirement Plan formula, meaning that he is\neligible for a benefit, actuarially reduced for early\ncommencement, under the\nInternational Staff Plan commencing upon his termination of\nemployment. He is eligible for an unreduced benefit commencing\nimmediately\nif he terminates employment after attaining age 60, or, if he\nterminates employment before age 60, he is eligible for an\nunreduced benefit\ncommencing at age 65. The International Staff Plan offered lump\nsum and life annuity distribution options to participants.\n\nPayments upon Termination or Change of Control\n\nGeneral Policies. Citi does not provide guaranteed\nexecutive severance or change of control agreements.\n\nPotential Payments Table.

Those\nstrategies,\nincluding regular analyses and reviews by Citi\u2019s Chief Risk\nOfficer and Chief Compliance Officer, are detailed on pages 76\nto\n77 and 95. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, management\nhas concluded that Citi\u2019s compensation plans are not reasonably\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on Citi.\n\nCEO Pay Ratio\n\nAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are providing the\nfollowing information about the relationship of the annual total\ncompensation\nof our employees to the annual total compensation of our CEO.\nThe pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable\nestimate calculated\nin a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.\n                                                                \n     For 2022, the median annual total compensation of all      \n  \u2022  employees of our company (other than the CEO) was          \n     $61,903, and the annual total compensation of our CEO was  \n     $22,076,861.(1)                                            \n     Based on this information, for 2022, the ratio of the      \n  \u2022  annual total compensation of our CEO to the median annual  \n     total compensation of all employees was estimated to be    \n     357 to 1.                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n       This number is the sum of the 2022 total compensation    \n       reported in the 2022 Summary Compensation                \n  (1)  Table and the value of employer contributions to         \n       broad-based employee benefit plans not already included  \n       in the Summary Compensation Table.                       \n                                                                \nThe following summarizes how we calculated our CEO pay:\n                                                                \n     The \u201cmedian annual total compensation of all employees\u201d    \n     is the annual total compensation                           \n     of a single employee who is at the midpoint of employees   \n     ranked in order of compensation amounts. When determining  \n     our midpoint, we considered                                \n     compensation of approximately 210,000 Citi employees       \n     (other than the CEO) who were employed by Citi on          \n  \u2022  December 31, 2020, in about 100                            \n     countries. We did not exclude any countries and we did     \n     not make any adjustments for the cost of living. We        \n     applied the data used to determine                         \n     the 2020 median in the calculation of the 2022 ratio       \n     because management believes that there has been no change  \n     in the employee population                                 \n     or employee compensation arrangements that would           \n     significantly impact Citi\u2019s CEO pay ratio disclosure.      \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     SEC regulations allow employers to identify the midpoint   \n     based on a \u201cconsistently applied compensation              \n     measure\u201d (CACM). We used 2020 base pay and cash payments   \n     under our incentive compensation plans as our CACM to      \n  \u2022  determine the midpoint                                     \n     of our employee population.

The initial share authorization under the 2019 Plan was\nintended to support grant activity for at least one year. At the\n2020 Annual Meeting, we requested and received approval for an  \nadditional 15 million shares; at the 2021 Annual Meeting we     \nrequested and received approval for an additional 20 million    \nshares; and at the 2022 Annual Meeting we requested and received\napproval for an additional 36 million shares. In each case, the \nrequest was intended to support grant activity for one year.    \nBeginning with incentive compensation for services rendered in  \n2021, 100% of deferrals for all employees eligible for annual   \ndiscretionary bonuses were indexed to and paid in Citi stock,   \nwhere local regulations permit. Previously, some incentive      \ncompensation was paid in deferred cash with interest. Our       \ncurrent share request is consistent with our approach on share  \nauthorizations, which is to request increases as often as       \nannually but only as needed to support grant activities for at  \nleast one year.                                                 \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n       Proposal                                                 \n  112  4: Approval of Additional Shares for the Citigroup 2019  \n       Stock Incentive Plan                                     \n                                                                \nOur Equity Award Practices Are Aligned with Stockholder         \nInterests                                                       \n                                                                \n     Equity                                                     \n     compensation aligns employee and stockholder interests.    \n     Citi\u2019s                                                     \n     equity awards are a key component of annual incentive      \n     awards for thousands of employees worldwide,               \n  \u25cf  thereby aligning the interests of stockholders and a       \n     broader group of Citi employees (not                       \n     just senior executives).

All members of such Committee or a sub-committee     \nthereof must satisfy the requirements for independence of SEC   \nRule 16b-3. With respect to participants who are outside        \nDirectors, the 2019 Plan is administered by the Board of        \nDirectors.

However, shares tendered by a participant or withheld by  \nCiti to pay an option exercise price, withheld or tendered to   \nsatisfy tax withholding obligations relating to any award,      \nrepurchased by Citi with option exercise proceeds, covered by a \nstock-settled SAR (without regard to the number of shares       \nactually issued upon exercise) or withheld to satisfy any debt  \nor other obligation owed to Citi, and cancelled fractional      \nshares will be considered issued and shall not be added to the  \nmaximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2019 Plan.\n                                                                \nLimits on awards.The maximum number of shares subject to awards \nto an individual Director in a calendar year (including awards  \nmade at the election of a Director in lieu of his or her cash   \nretainer), taken together with any cash fees paid during the    \ncalendar year to the Director, in respect of the Director\u2019s     \nservice as a member of the Board of Directors during such year  \n(including service as a member or chair of any committees of the\nBoard), may not exceed $1 million in value, as determined as of \nthe date of each award. However, the independent members of the \nBoard of Directors may make exceptions to this limit for a non- \nexecutive chair of the Board, provided that the Director        \nreceiving any additional compensation may not participate in the\ndecision to award such compensation. For all other eligible     \n\u201cemployees,\u201d the number of shares subject to stock options or   \nSARs granted during a calendar year may not exceed one million  \nshares, and the number of shares that may be subject to stock   \nawards granted in a calendar year may not exceed one million    \nshares, unless granted subject to substitute awards that replace\nawards of a former employer acquired by the Company.            \n                                                                \nTypes of awards.The following types of awards may be made under \nthe 2019 Plan:                                                  \n                                                                \n     Stock                                                      \n     options. An award of a                                     \n     stock option under the 2019 Plan grants a participant the  \n     right to purchase a specified number                       \n     of shares of Citi common stock during a specified term in  \n  \u25cf  the future at an exercise price                            \n     equal to at least 100% of the \u201cfair market value\u201d (see     \n     below) of Citi common                                      \n     stock on the grant date. The term of a stock option may    \n     not exceed 10 years from the date                          \n     of grant.                                                  \n     Stock                                                      \n     appreciation rights (SARs).

A restricted stock                                  \n     award is an award of outstanding shares of Citi common     \n     stock that does not vest until vesting                     \n     conditions are satisfied and which will be forfeited if    \n     conditions to vesting are not met.                         \n  \u25cf  Participants may receive dividends on the shares subject   \n     to their awards during the vesting                         \n     period, unless the awards are subject to one or more       \n     performance conditions, in which case                      \n     the dividends, if any, shall be paid only if and when,     \n     and only to the extent that, the underlying                \n     shares vest.                                               \n     Deferred                                                   \n     stock. A deferred stock                                    \n     award is an unfunded, unsecured promise to deliver shares  \n     of Citi common stock to the participant                    \n     in the future, if the participant satisfies the            \n     conditions to vesting. Participants do not                 \n     have voting rights (their rights are no greater than a     \n  \u25cf  general unsecured creditor of the                          \n     Company), but may receive dividend equivalent payments     \n     during the vesting period, unless                          \n     the awards are subject to one or more performance          \n     conditions, in which case the dividend                     \n     equivalents, if any, shall be paid to participants only    \n     if and when, and only to the extent                        \n     that, the underlying shares vest.                          \n     Other                                                      \n     stock-based awards.

For the avoidance of                          \n     doubt, awards that by their terms shall be settled only    \n     in cash shall not be considered to                         \n     have been granted under the 2019 Plan.                     \n     Performance-based                                          \n     awards. Subject to the                                     \n  \u25cf  terms of the 2019 Plan, the Compensation Committee may     \n     grant awards that are subject to one                       \n     or more performance conditions related to a performance    \n     period of not less than one year.                          \n                                                                \nMinimum vesting requirement.Awards granted under the 2019 Plan  \nmay not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date on  \nwhich the award is granted, except that the Compensation        \nCommittee may grant awards that vest in less than a year (i) as \na \u201csubstitute award\u201d to replace awards of a former employer     \nacquired by the Company, (ii) awards to Directors that vest on  \nthe earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and\nthe next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50    \nweeks after the immediately preceding year\u2019s annual meeting, and\n(iii) any additional awards the Compensation Committee may      \ngrant, up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available    \nshare reserve authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan. This \nrestriction does not apply to the Compensation Committee\u2019s      \ndiscretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting \nof any award, including in cases of retirement, death,          \ndisability, leave of absence, termination of employment, change \nof control, or upon the sale or other disposition of the        \nsubsidiary employing a participant or other similar event.      \n                                                                \nPerformance conditions.In the case of an award subject to a     \nperformance condition, the applicable performance condition may \ninclude one or more of the following performance conditions and \nbe expressed in either, or a combination of, absolute or        \nrelative values or a percentage of: revenue, revenue or product \ngrowth, net income (pre- or after-tax), earnings, earnings per  \nshare, stockholders\u2019 equity or return on stockholders\u2019 equity,  \nassets or return on assets, return on risk-adjusted assets,     \ncapital or return on capital, return on risk capital, book value\nor book value per share, economic value-added models or         \nequivalent metrics, operating income, pre- or after-tax income, \nexpenses or reengineering savings, margins, cash flow or cash   \nflow per share, stock price, total shareholder return, market   \nshare, debt reduction, net promoter scores, operating efficiency\nratios, expense ratios, liquidity ratios, regulatory            \nachievements, or any objective or subjective performance        \nconditions selected by the Compensation Committee.              \n                                                                \nProhibition against repricing.The 2019 Plan prohibits any action\nunder the 2019 Plan that would constitute a \u201drepricing\u201d of any  \noutstanding option or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, the 2014 \nPlan, the 2009 Plan or any other plan of the Company or of any  \nacquired company, except with the approval of the stockholders  \nof the Company. The 2019 Plan defines \u201crepricing\u201d to mean: (i)  \nany action that constitutes a \u201crepricing\u201d under GAAP or the     \nrules of the NYSE (including any modification or amendment to an\noutstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing its   \nexercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an outstanding option \nor SAR when its exercise price exceeds its fair market value in \nexchange for cash; (iii) any cancellation of an option or SAR in\nexchange for a new option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or\n(iv) a substitution of a stock award for an option or SAR when  \nits exercise price exceeds fair market value; in each case other\nthan a permitted equitable adjustment.                          \n                                                                \nProhibition of reload options.The 2019 Plan does not permit the \ngrant of \u201creload\u201d options.                                      \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n       Proposal                                                 \n  118  4: Approval of Additional Shares for the Citigroup 2019  \n       Stock Incentive Plan                                     \n                                                                \nRepayment obligation; right of set-off.If the Compensation      \nCommittee subsequently determines that all conditions to vesting\nand payment of an award, or the vesting and exercisability of an\noption or SAR, were not satisfied in full, the Compensation     \nCommittee may cancel such vesting or exercise and refuse to     \nissue shares and immediately terminate the participant\u2019s rights \nwith respect to such award (or improperly vested portion        \nthereof). If the vesting or exercise of any such award (or      \nportion thereof) has already been settled by delivery of shares \nor cash, the participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to    \nreturn the shares or cash (or higher value received at vesting  \nor exercise), to Citi, without reduction for any shares or cash \nwithheld to satisfy withholding tax or other obligations.       \nConsistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal\nRevenue Code, the 2019 Plan also provides for the set-off of    \nvested awards against obligations a participant may owe to Citi,\nincluding but not limited to the obligation to repay improperly \nvested or exercised awards. Any failure to timely pay tax-      \nrelated obligations owed to Citi in connection with an award may\nresult in its cancellation.                                     \n                                                                \nNon-transferability.During the vesting period, awards and sale- \nrestricted shares generally are not transferable other than by  \nwill or the laws of descent and distribution.                   \n                                                                \nAdjustments.The 2019 Plan provides that the Compensation        \nCommittee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the   \nmaximum number of shares available for grant under the 2019 Plan\nand to the annual individual award limits expressed in numbers  \nof shares in the event of any changes to the Company\u2019s capital  \nstructure, including a change in the number of shares           \noutstanding on account of any stock dividend, stock split,      \nreverse stock split, spinoff or any similar equity              \nrestructuring, or any combination or exchange of equity         \nsecurities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization,            \nreorganization, or similar transaction. In the event of any such\ntransaction, or any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or     \nother distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of      \nassets to stockholders, the Compensation Committee shall make   \nappropriate equitable adjustments to the number or kind of      \nshares subject to outstanding awards, the exercise prices of    \noutstanding options and SARs, and performance conditions, to the\nextent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of    \nparticipants\u2019 rights.                                           \n                                                                \nChange of control.The Compensation Committee may, when an award \nis made, or at any time prior to, at, or after the time of a    \n\u201cchange of control\u201d (as defined below), provide for the         \nadjustment of performance conditions to reflect the change of   \ncontrol, provide for the cancellation of outstanding awards if  \nthe surviving entity or acquiring entity (or the surviving or   \nacquiring entity\u2019s parent company) replaces the awards with new \nrights of substantially equivalent value, provide for the       \nacceleration of any time periods or the waiver of any other     \nconditions to vesting, exercise, payment, or distribution of an \naward upon an involuntary termination of a participant\u2019s        \nemployment as a result of a change of control, or provide for   \nthe purchase of any award. The vesting, payment, purchase, or   \ndistribution of an award, however, may not be accelerated by    \nreason of a change of control for any participant unless the    \nparticipant\u2019s employment is involuntarily terminated as a result\nof the change of control. For these purposes, a termination of  \nemployment as a result of a change of control means involuntary \ntermination of employment other than for \u201cgross misconduct\u201d (as \ndefined in the 2019 Plan) upon, or on or prior to the first     \nanniversary of, the change of control.                          \n                                                                \nThe 2019 Plan defines a \u201cchange of control\u201d to mean (i) a person\nacquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership of Citigroup  \nInc. securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting \npower of then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii)    \nspecified changes in the majority of the Board (not including   \nthe election of Directors whose election or nomination was      \napproved by a majority of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a    \nsale, transfer, or distribution of all or substantially all of  \nthe assets of Citigroup Inc. or a dissolution or liquidation of \nCitigroup Inc.; or (iv) consummation of a reorganization,       \nmerger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction that      \nresults in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not owning more than  \n50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other     \ncorporation resulting from the transaction.                     \n                                                                \nTax withholding.Citi retains the right to deduct or withhold, or\nrequire the participant to remit to his or her employer, an     \namount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, and foreign \ntaxes (including hypothetical taxes owed to Citi by tax-        \nequalized expatriates) required by law or regulation to be      \nwithheld with respect to any taxable event as a result of the   \n2019 Plan.                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                                                \n  PROPOSAL                                                      \n  3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR\u00a02022 EXECUTIVE           119  \n  COMPENSATION                                                  \n                                                                \nVoting.The 2019 Plan provides that unless the Compensation      \nCommittee determines otherwise, participants who receive awards \nof stock are generally entitled to direct the voting of the     \nshares underlying their awards on matters submitted to a vote of\nstockholders. All shares underlying such awards as to which no  \nvoting instructions are received are voted proportionately,     \nbased on the voting instructions received with respect to all   \nother such shares.                                              \n                                                                \nAmendment and termination.The 2019 Plan may be amended,         \nsuspended, or terminated by the Compensation Committee at any   \ntime, provided that no amendment shall be made without          \nstockholder approval if it would materially increase the number \nof shares available under the 2019 Plan (other than in          \nconnection with an equitable adjustment), materially expand the \ntypes of awards available under the 2019 Plan or the class of   \npersons eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan, materially    \nextend the term of the 2019 Plan, materially change the method  \nof determining the exercise price of an option or SAR granted   \nunder the 2019 Plan, delete or limit the prohibition against    \n\u201crepricing,\u201d or otherwise require approval by stockholders in   \norder to comply with applicable law or the rules of the NYSE (or\nprincipal national securities exchange upon which Citi\u2019s common \nstock is traded or quoted).                                     \n                                                                \nAward modification.The Compensation Committee retains the right \nto modify outstanding awards without a participant\u2019s prior      \nconsent if it determines that the modification is required to   \ncomply with applicable law, regulation, or regulatory guidance  \n(including applicable tax law). Subject to certain exceptions,  \nany other modifications, if adverse to a participant, shall not \nbe effective without the participant\u2019s written consent.         \n                                                                \nCertain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences                    \n                                                                \nThe following is a brief summary of the principal U.S. federal  \nincome tax consequences relating to stock options granted under \nthe 2019 Plan, based on current U.S. federal income tax laws.   \nThis summary does not constitute tax advice and, among other    \nthings, does not describe state, local, or foreign tax          \nconsequences, which may be substantially different.             \n                                                                \nGenerally, a participant will not recognize taxable income on   \nthe grant of a stock option. Upon the exercise of a stock       \noption, a participant will recognize ordinary income in an      \namount equal to the difference between the fair market value of \nthe Citi common stock received on the date of exercise and the  \noption cost (number of shares purchased multiplied by the       \nexercise price per share). The participant will recognize       \nordinary income upon the exercise of the option even though the \nshares acquired may be subject to further restrictions on sale  \nor transferability. Citi will ordinarily be entitled to a       \ndeduction on the exercise date in an amount equal to the amount \nof ordinary income recognized by the participant upon exercise, \nexcept as may be specified under Section 162(m) of the Internal \nRevenue Code. Generally, upon a subsequent sale of shares       \nacquired in an option exercise, the difference between the sale \nproceeds and the cost basis of the shares sold will be taxable  \nas a capital gain or loss, including any sale of shares freed   \nfrom sale restrictions to fund the payment of taxes incurred at \nexercise.

We believe that an annual advisory vote on     \nexecutive compensation is the most appropriate option for us    \nbecause it will allow our stockholders to provide more frequent,\ndirect input on our compensation policies and practices, and the\nresulting compensation for our named executive officers.        \nStockholders will have the opportunity to consider our most     \nrecent compensation decisions and focus on increasing long-term \nstockholder value, and to provide feedback to us in a timely    \nway. The Board of Directors also believes an annual advisory    \nstockholder vote promotes corporate transparency and            \naccountability for the Compensation Committee.                  \n                                                                \nMaking this recommendation, the Board of Directors took into    \naccount that a majority of the votes cast at our 2017 Annual    \nMeeting voted in favor of holding an annual advisory vote on    \nexecutive compensation. In addition, we are aware of the        \nsignificant interest in executive compensation matters by       \ninvestors and the general public, and value and encourage       \nconstructive dialogue with our stockholders on these matters. We\nunderstand that our stockholders may have different views as to \nwhat is the best approach for the Board of Directors, and we    \nlook forward to hearing from our stockholders on this proposal. \n                                                                \nThis advisory resolution is non-binding on our Board of         \nDirectors. Although we currently believe that holding an        \nadvisory vote on executive compensation every year would reflect\nthe right balance of considerations, we will continue to        \nperiodically reassess that view and can provide for an advisory \nvote on executive compensation on a less frequent basis if long-\nterm stability in our compensation program or other             \ncircumstances suggest that such a vote frequency would be more  \nappropriate.                                                    \n                                                                \nAccordingly, you are asked to vote on the following nonbinding  \nadvisory resolution:                                            \n                                                                \nRESOLVED,that future advisory votes on executive compensation of\nthe nature reflected in Proposal 3 should occur every year.     \n                                                                \n  Board Recommendation                                          \n  The Board recommends that you vote 1                          \n  Year on Proposal 5, which is advisory approval of an ANNUAL   \n  stockholder advisory vote regarding compensation awarded to   \n  Citigroup\u2019s named executive officers.                         \n                                                                \nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement                                       \n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n       \n  121  \n       \nStockholder Proposals\n\nCiti makes every effort to be responsive to concerns\nexpressed by our stockholders by engaging in dialogues,\nparticipating in issuer/investor working groups, and adopting\npolicies or initiatives\nwe believe to be in the best interests of all stockholders. Over\nthe years, Citi has met with several proponents and other\ninterested\nparties regarding such issues as gender pay equity, proxy\naccess, human rights, climate change, net zero, racial equity,\nculture, risk\nmanagement, auditor rotation, and trade association payments,\namong others, and has, on certain occasions, as appropriate,\ntaken action\nin response to these engagements and/or stockholder votes. For\nexample, in 2021, Citi collaborated with a shareholder to\noutline the scope\nof a Racial Equity Audit for its Action for Racial Equity\ncommitments and in 2019, Citi\u2019s Board of Directors lowered the\nSpecial\nMeeting threshold in response to the stockholder vote at the\n2019 Annual Meeting. We encourage our stockholders to\ncommunicate with management\nand the Board. Any stockholder wishing to communicate with\nmanagement, the Board, or an individual Director, or obtain the\naddresses of\nany of the stockholder proponents or their Citi stock ownership\ninformation, should send a request to the Corporate Secretary,\nBrent J.\nMcIntosh, at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013.\n\nProposal 6\n\nJohn Chevedden has submitted the following proposal\nfor consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting.\n    Proposal 6 \u2014 Shareholder Ratification of Termination Pay    \nShareholders request that the Board seek shareholder\napproval of any senior manager\u2019s new or renewed pay package that\nprovides for severance or termination payments with an estimated\nvalue exceeding 2.99 times the sum of the executive\u2019s base\nsalary plus target short-term bonus.\n\n\u201cSeverance or termination payments\u201d\ninclude cash, equity or other compensation that is paid out or\nvests due to a senior executive\u2019s termination for any reason.\nPayments\ninclude those provided under employment agreements, severance\nplans, and change-in-control clauses in long-term equity plans,\nbut not\nlife insurance, pension benefits, or deferred compensation\nearned and vested prior to termination.\n\n\u201cEstimated total value\u201d includes: lump-sum\npayments; payments offsetting tax liabilities; perquisites or\nbenefits not vested under a plan generally available to\nmanagement employees;\npost-employment consulting fees or office expense; and equity\nawards if vesting is accelerated, or a performance condition\nwaived, due\nto termination.\n\nThe Board shall retain the option to seek shareholder\napproval after material terms are agreed upon.\n\nGenerous performance-based pay can be okay but shareholder\nratification of \u201cgolden parachute\u201d severance packages with a\ntotal cost exceeding 2.99 times base salary plus target bonus\nbetter aligns management pay with shareholder interests.\n\nFor instance at one company, that does not have\nthis policy, if the CEO is terminated he could receive $44\nmillion in termination pay - over 10 times his base salary plus\nshort-term\nbonus. The same person could receive a whopping $124 million in\naccelerated equity payouts even if he remained employed in the\nevent of\na change in control.\n\nIt is in the best interest of Citigroup shareholders\nand the morale of Citigroup employees to be protected from such\nlavish management termination packages for one person.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  122  Stockholder Proposals  \n                              \nIt is important to have this policy in place so\nthat Citigroup management stays focused on improving company\nperformance as opposed to seeking an ill-advised merger mostly\nto trigger\na management golden parachute windfall.\n\nShareholder Ratification of Excessive Termination Pay, the\ntopic of this proposal, received between 51 % and 65% support\nat:\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nFedEx (FDX)\n\nSpirit AeroSystems (SPR)\n\nAlaska Air (ALK)\n\nFiserv (FISV)\n                        Please vote yes:                        \n                                                                \n    Shareholder Ratification of Termination Pay \u2014 Proposal 6    \nManagement Comment\nSummary\nCiti has appropriate policies in place to guard\nagainst excessive severance arrangements. As Citi has stated in\nits Proxy Statement for many years, and restates on pages 96-97,\nCiti\u2019s\nexecutive officers do not have special agreements covering their\ncompensation in the event of a change of control and are not\nentitled\nto severance pay upon termination of employment in excess of\nbroad-based benefits.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s Compensation Philosophy\nand Incentive Compensation Policy provide that incentive\ncompensation at Citi is intended to incentivize appropriate risk\nand control\nbehavior and outcomes, and to be compliant with applicable laws,\nregulations and regulatory guidance. Applicable regulatory\nguidance specifically\ncautions financial institutions that \u201cin all cases, a banking\norganization should ensure that the structure and terms of any\ngolden\nparachute arrangement entered into by the organization\u201d are\nappropriate from a safety and soundness perspective.\n\nFurthermore, as a matter of internal governance,\nthe Compensation, Performance Management and Culture Committee\nof Citi\u2019s Board is authorized and required to \u201creview and\napprove\nthe material terms of employment and retention agreements\n(including offer letters), severance arrangements, change in\ncontrol agreements,\nand any special supplemental benefits for executive officers and\nmembers of the Executive Management Team,\u201d as stated in the\nCommittee\u2019s\nCharter. For employees below the level of the Executive\nManagement Team, Citi\u2019s CEO is required to approve any severance\naward in\nexcess of $1 million. Those governance requirements are designed\nto prevent the payment of excessive severance benefits.\n\nHowever, Citi\u2019s management must also have\nthe flexibility to tailor compensation, which may include\nseverance provisions, to attract and retain talent in highly\ncompetitive markets,\nincluding in light of rules in the many jurisdictions around the\nworld in which we operate. Rather than giving Citi\u2019s management\nappropriate flexibility, the Proposal gives rise to ambiguity\nand inconsistencies. Were the Proposal to be adopted, the\nambiguities and\ninconsistencies in the Proposal could be highly problematic.\n\nSpecifically, the Proposal uses off-the-shelf language\nnot tailored to Citi\u2019s business and circumstances, and sometimes\nuses terms in inconsistent ways.\n\nFor example, the Proposal would require severance\npayments to be limited to \u201c2.99 times the sum of the executive\u2019s\nbase salary plus target short-term bonus,\u201d but Citi\ndoes not use \u201cshort-term target bonuses\u201d in its compensation\nprogram. In the absence of target bonuses, the Proposal could\nbe interpreted to require that the Board limit severance\npayments to 2.99 times base salary alone, which is inconsistent\nwith Citi\u2019s\nbusiness needs.\n\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                    \n  Stockholder  123  \n  Proposals         \n                    \nSimilarly, the Proposal says in its first paragraph\nthat the severance payment limitation should apply to \u201csenior\nmanagers.\u201d However, the term \u201csenior manager\u201d is\nnot defined, which creates uncertainties about the scope of the\npolicy that could lead to protracted delays that impede the\nrecruitment\nof top personnel.\n\nFinally, because the Proposal\u2019s apparent reach\nis so broad, it could potentially include payments required by\nforeign laws (in the case of non-U.S. executives), as well as\npayments\nunder various benefit plans not generally understood to\nconstitute severance or termination pay.\nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n        The Proposal is not necessary to ensure that Citi does  \n  \u00d8     not pay excessive severance benefits, as Citi has       \n        adequate policies in place to guard against that risk:  \n        As Citi has publicly disclosed for many years, and as   \n     \u2713  stated on pages 96-97, Citi executive officers are not  \n        entitled to severance pay upon termination of           \n        employment in excess of broad-based benefits.           \n        Citi\u2019s compensation practices are governed by its       \n        Compensation Philosophy and Incentive Compensation      \n        Policy, which requires Citi to adopt compensation       \n     \u2713  practices that comply with U.S. and global bank         \n        regulatory requirements. Banking regulators have        \n        explicitly cautioned that excessive severance is not    \n        consistent with bank safety and soundness.              \n        Recognizing shareholders\u2019 desire that departing         \n        executives not receive excessive pay packages, and      \n        consistent with its historic practice of providing      \n        reasonable severance arrangements for its executives,   \n     \u2713  Citi\u2019s Board, in 2002, adopted a resolution             \n        prohibiting payments to an executive of three times or  \n        more of that executive\u2019s annual income in the event of  \n        a change of control of Citi without the approval of     \n        stockholders.                                           \n        Citi practices are consistent with market practices     \n        for large financial institutions, and Citi would be     \n  \u00d8     placed at a competitive disadvantage in attracting and  \n        retaining the best employees if the Proposal were       \n        adopted:                                                \n        The severance benefits that could be covered by the     \n        Proposal include, for example, amounts payable          \n        pursuant to customary provisions in sign-on or          \n     \u2713  replacement awards needed to attract or retain key      \n        talent, since sign-on and replacement awards            \n        frequently must continue to be paid following           \n        involuntary termination of employment without cause.    \n        Imposing stringent guidelines for compensation in       \n        order to ensure a favorable vote by stockholders after  \n        the terms of a contract have been agreed upon           \n     \u2713  eliminates the flexibility that is needed to respond    \n        to the dynamics of negotiating during recruitment and   \n        in response to potential departures of valued           \n        employees.                                              \n        The shareholder approval alternative included in the    \n        Proposal recognizes that a formulaic approach to        \n        compensation is not always prudent; sometimes judgment  \n        about what is best for a business is required. Rather   \n        than letting Citi\u2019s Board exercise that judgment, as    \n     \u2713  it should, the Proposal suggests that shareholders      \n        should be asked to do so. That suggestion is very       \n        impractical. Accordingly, it does not meaningfully      \n        address the shortcomings of the Proposal\u2019s formulaic    \n        approach, even as it implicitly recognizes those        \n        shortcomings.                                           \n        The Proposal is ambiguous and uses boilerplate          \n        language not tailored to Citi. For example, Citi does   \n  \u00d8     not have \u201cshort-term target bonuses\u201d and the term       \n        \u201csenior manager\u201d is not defined, hobbling Citi\u2019s        \n        ability to properly interpret or apply the Proposal.    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Because                                                       \n  Citi\u2019s current practices regarding payments under severance   \n  agreements sufficiently address the concerns raised by the    \n  Proposal,                                                     \n  the Proposal, if adopted, would put Citi at a competitive     \n  disadvantage, and because the terms of the Proposal are not   \n  applicable                                                    \n  to Citi\u2019s pay programs making it difficult to interpret and   \n  execute, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal    \n  6.                                                            \n                                                                \n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  124  Stockholder Proposals  \n                              \nProposal 7\n\nKenneth Steiner has submitted the following proposal\nfor consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting.\n            Proposal 7 \u2013 Independent Board Chairman             \nShareholders request that the Board of Directors\nadopt an enduring policy, and amend the governing documents as\nnecessary in order that 2 separate people hold the office of the\nChairman\nand the office of the CEO\n\nWhenever possible, the Chairman of the Board shall\nbe an Independent Director.\n\nThe Board has the discretion to select a Temporary\nChairman of the Board who is not an Independent Director to\nserve while the Board is seeking an Independent Chairman of the\nBoard.\n\nThis policy could be phased in when there is a contract\nrenewal for our current CEO or for the next CEO transition.\n\nThis proposal topic won 52% support at Boeing and\n54% support at Baxter International in 2020. Boeing then adopted\nthis proposal topic.\n\nManagement says it supports having an independent\nDirector in a Board leadership position. However management\ninconsistently has a bylaw that allows it to indefinitely have\none person\nhold the 2 most important jobs at Citigroup as long as there is\na so-called lead director.\n\nThe so-called lead director could then have excessive\nboard tenure that would impair director independence. The lead\ndirector could also be a person who staunchly believes the 2\nmost important\njobs in a $250 Billion company like Citigroup should be held by\none person and that the person holding the 2 positions at once\nshould be given the upmost deference.\n\nA lead director is no substitute for an independent\nboard chairman. A lead director cannot call a special\nshareholder meeting and cannot even call a special meeting of\nthe board. A lead\ndirector can delegate most of his lead director duties to others\nand then simply rubber-stamp it. There is no way shareholders\ncan be\nsure of what goes on.\n\nA lead director can be given a list of duties but\nthere is no rule that prevents the Chairman from overriding the\nlead director in any of the so-called lead director duties.\n\nUnfortunately management has stacked the deck against\nthis worthy proposal. For instance management sends out multiple\nreminders for shareholders to vote to the very shareholders who\nare most likely to have no independent proxy voting advice.\nThus, the shareholder support for this proposal topic at\nCitigroup will be\nunderstated.\n                        Please vote yes:                        \n                                                                \n            Independent Board Chairman \u2014 Proposal 7             \nManagement Comment\nSummary\nSince 2009, Citi has had an independent Chair separate\nfrom the CEO. The Board firmly supports having an independent\nDirector in a Board leadership position at all times. As such,\nCiti\u2019s\nBoard, on December 15, 2009, adopted a By-law amendment which\nprovides that if Citi does not have an independent Chair, the\nBoard will\nelect an independent Lead Director having similar duties to an\nindependent Chair, including leading the executive sessions of\nthe non-management\nDirectors at Board meetings. Citi\u2019s Board has determined that\nthe current structure, an independent Chair separate from the\nCEO,\nis the most appropriate structure at this time, while ensuring\nthat, at\n\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                    \n  Stockholder  125  \n  Proposals         \n                    \nall times, there will be an independent Director\nin a Board leadership position. Since Citi\u2019s Board has adopted a\nframework that provides for either an independent Chair or an\nindependent\nLead Director, the Board believes that this Proposal is not\nnecessary.\nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n        As required by Citi\u2019s By-Laws, the Board elects its     \n        Chairman annually, and, for each of the last 13 years,  \n        the Board has elected an independent director to serve  \n        as Board Chair. Citi\u2019s By-laws ensure that there will   \n        be an independent member of the Board in a leadership   \n        position at all times. Rather than formally separating  \n  \u00d8     the roles of CEO and Chairman, it is in the best        \n        interests of Citi\u2019s shareholders to retain flexibility  \n        to determine the optimal leadership structure at any    \n        given time, while ensuring that an independent board    \n        member oversees the Board. The Board values the         \n        flexibility of selecting the structure of leadership    \n        best suited to meet the needs of the Company and its    \n        shareholders.                                           \n        If the roles of Chairman and CEO are combined, Citi\u2019s   \n        Guidelines provide that the Board will designate a      \n        lead director from among the independent directors. As  \n  \u00d8     set forth in the Guidelines, the duties of the          \n        independent Lead Director and the non-executive chair   \n        include, but are not limited to, the following          \n        functions:                                              \n        presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the     \n     \u2713  Chair is not present, including executive sessions of   \n        the independent Directors;                              \n     \u2713  serving as liaison between the Executive Chair and the  \n        independent Directors;                                  \n     \u2713  approving information sent to the Board;                \n     \u2713  approving meeting agendas for the Board;                \n        approving meeting schedules to assure that there is     \n     \u2713  sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;     \n        and                                                     \n     \u2713  having the authority to call meetings of the            \n        independent Directors.                                  \n        Citi has an empowered independent Board that provides   \n        oversight. As previously noted, Citi has had an         \n        independent Chair since 2009. Twelve of the Board\u2019s     \n        thirteen current directors, and 100% of each of the     \n        Board\u2019s Audit Committee; Compensation, Performance      \n        Management and Culture Committee; and Nomination,       \n  \u00d8     Governance and Public Affairs Committee satisfy the     \n        independence standards of the NYSE, Citi\u2019s              \n        independence standards, and other regulatory            \n        independence requirements. Moreover, the Board holds    \n        executive sessions of its independent directors         \n        throughout the year, at which the independent Chair     \n        presides.                                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  The                                                           \n  shareholder proposal is unnecessary given the current         \n  framework the Board has in place to ensure independent        \n  leadership for the Board                                      \n  at all times and could restrict the Board\u2019s decision-making   \n  ability and limit the options available to the Board in       \n  structuring                                                   \n  effective leadership; therefore the Board recommends a vote   \n  AGAINST this Proposal 7.                                      \n                                                                \nProposal 8\n\nThe Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace, the Sisters\nof St. Dominic of Caldwell, NJ, The Sisters of St. Francis of\nPhiladelphia, and United Church Funds have submitted the\nfollowing proposal\nfor consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting.\n\nResolved: Shareholders request the Board\nof Directors provide a report to shareholders, at reasonable\ncost and omitting proprietary and confidential information,\noutlining the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s policies, practices, and\nperformance indicators in respecting internationally-recognized\nhuman rights\nstandards for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights in its existing and\nproposed general corporate and project financing.\n\nWhereas: The UN Declaration on the Rights\nof Indigenous Peoples and International Labour Organization\nConvention 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in\nIndependent Countries\nare internationally-recognized standards for Indigenous Peoples\u2019\nrights. Violation of these rights presents risks for\nCitigroup that can adversely affect shareholder value, including\nreputational damage, project disruptions, and civil and criminal\nliability.\nCitigroup has a history of financing projects and companies that\nviolate Indigenous rights, most notably as a lead financier of\nthe Dakota\nAccess pipeline in 2016. Recently, Citigroup provided over $5\nbillion to Enbridge, enabling the widely opposed Enbridge Line\n3 and Line 5 tar sands pipeline reroutes.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  126  Stockholder Proposals  \n                              \nIndigenous leaders from the Great Lakes tribes have\ncalled Enbridge\u2019s Line 5 pipeline reroute \u201can act of cultural\ngenocide.\u201d A 2022 ruling found that Line 5\nwas operating illegally on Bad River Band territory since 2013.\nMichigan Governor Whitmer canceled Enbridge\u2019s certification\nin 2020, citing \u201cEnbridge\u2019s historic failures and current non-\ncompliance\u201d as jeopardizing the safety of Michigan residents\nand the environment. Michigan\u2019s twelve federally recognized\nTribal Nations requested President Biden to decommission\nLine 5 in 2021, and the pipeline faces ongoing litigation from\nnumerous plaintiffs. The severity of Indigenous\nopposition is reflected by the Bay Mills Indian Community\nformally banishing the pipeline from its reservation, noting\nEnbridge\u2019s\ndeceptive tactics, poor environmental track record, and risk of\n\u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d to Indigenous rights. Companies\nlike Enbridge, financed by Citigroup, consistently fail to meet\nthe international standard of free, prior, and informed consent\n(FPIC)\nwith affected tribes.\n\nCitigroup simultaneously faces calls from Indigenous\nleaders to stop financing oil and gas operations in the Amazon\nthat pose \u201can existential threat\u201d to Indigenous Peoples.\nA 2022 Investor Risk Alert reported that Citigroup has the\nlargest financial involvement of all foreign banks, an estimated\n$43.8 billion,\nin oil and gas operations in the Amazon basin.\n\nCitigroup faces reputational risk if its \u201cclimate\nforward\u201d commitments are discredited by its own financing\nactivities. Citigroup\u2019s human rights and risk management\npolicies do not clearly define FPIC, nor include guidance on how\nCitigroup addresses companies with track records of violating\nIndigenous\nrights. Though Citigroup adheres to the Equator Principles to\nmanage environmental and social risk, Indigenous experts have\ndescribed\nthem as \u201ccritically weak\u201d and not aligned with international\nhuman rights standards. Effective policies that\nprotect Indigenous rights are critical to managing material\nrisk.\n                                                                \n     https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/de\u2026  \n  1  ;                                                          \n     https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/sites/default/files\u2026  \n  2  ;                                                          \n     https://amazonwatch.org/news/2022/0622-the-business-case\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  3  https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/usa-\u2026  \n     without-sufficient-regard-for-indigenous-peoples-concern\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RAN-Brief\u2026  \n  4  ;                                                          \n     https://sightline-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/upl\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                         \n  5  https://www.stopline3.org/news/women-leaders-line5  \n                                                         \n                                                                \n  6  https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  7  https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/news/press-releases/202\u2026  \n     5-dual-pipelines-through-the-straits-of-mackina            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  8  https://www.baymills.org/_files/ugd/869f65_f8e5288d82084\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  9  https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/enbridge-takes-the-g\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  10  https://narf.org/nill/documents/20210510BayMills_banish\u2026  \n      1503385769.1619537483                                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  11.  https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Do\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  12  https://www.stand.earth/latest/forest-conservation/amaz\u2026  \n      forward%E2%80%9D-reputation-remains                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  13  https://www.stand.earth/sites/stand/files/citiriskalert\u2026  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  14  https://www.stand.earth/latest/forest-conservation/amaz\u2026  \n      forward%E2%80%9D-reputation-remains                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  15  https://www.colorado.edu/program/fpw/2019/11/19/first-p\u2026  \n      global-development                                        \n                                                                \nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                    \n  Stockholder  127  \n  Proposals         \n                    \nManagement Comment\nSummary\nThe Proposal requests that Citi prepare a report\nto shareholders outlining how effective Citigroup\u2019s policies,\npractices, and performance indicators are in respecting\ninternationally\nrecognized human rights standards for Indigenous Peoples in its\nexisting and proposed general corporate and project financing.\nIn the\nsupporting statement to the Proposal, the proponent asserts that\nCiti is providing $5 billion in financing to the Enbridge Line 3\npipeline\nexpansion, which is untrue. Citi has provided no project-related\nfinancing to the Enbridge Line 3 project; moreover, the claimed\namount would represent nearly 75% of the capital Citi has\ncommitted to the entire portfolio of oil and gas storage and\ntransportation\nsub-sector at 2021 year-end (as disclosed in our 2022 Task Force\non Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report: Citi\u2019s Approach\nto Climate Change and Net Zero). Currently no one client\u2019s\ncommitted capital represents an amount close to a majority of\nthe portfolio.\n\nIn sensitive sectors such as oil and gas, Citi reviews\nclients to evaluate environmental and social policies and\npractices and to identify if these clients\u2019 operations may pose\npotential\nrisks to sensitive areas such as Indigenous communities or\ntraditional lands, or areas of high biodiversity. When\nidentified, these \u201cAreas\nof High Caution\u201d named in Citi\u2019s Environmental and Social Risk\nManagement (ESRM) Policy trigger special consideration, enhanced\ndue diligence and client engagement to understand if the client\nhas appropriate policies, staffing, and management systems to\naddress\nthese sensitive risks to avoid harm. It is precisely this type\nof due diligence and engagement in project and general corporate\npurposes\nfinancing that helps Citi meet its responsibility to respect\nhuman rights, including Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights, and allows\nus to\nuse our leverage with our clients to respect these rights.\nImportant Points to Consider\n                                                                \n     Since 2003, Citi has demonstrated its commitment to        \n     environmental sustainability and human rights through      \n     implementation of its ESRM Policy. This Policy sets forth  \n     standards for how the Company assesses its clients\u2019        \n     management of impacts on the environment (such as          \n     biodiversity, pollution control, and climate) and society  \n     (such as employee health and safety and human rights of    \n  \u00d8  local communities and Indigenous Peoples). Citi\u2019s ESRM     \n     Policy incorporates the International Finance Corporation  \n     Performance Standards as well as the Equator Principles,   \n     a leading financial sector risk management framework for   \n     project-related finance that Citi co-founded in 2003.      \n     Both of these frameworks cover important human rights      \n     considerations, including stakeholder engagement, labor    \n     issues and the rights of Indigenous Peoples.               \n     The proposal rightly highlights Citi\u2019s leadership in       \n     developing the Equator Principles. As part of Citi\u2019s       \n     commitment to the communities in which it works, in 2018   \n     the Company updated its ESRM Policy to strengthen and      \n     expand its Area of High Caution globally in                \n     project-related financings with potential risks to         \n     Indigenous Peoples. In turn, we led an update to the EP    \n     requirements regarding Free, Prior and Informed Consent    \n     for Indigenous Peoples in project-related finance \u2013        \n     driving strengthened practices across the market. It is    \n  \u00d8  important to note, however, that the Equator Principles    \n     apply only to project-related loans where banks have       \n     increased risk, access and leverage, and do not apply to   \n     general corporate purpose financings that support broad    \n     international operations of our clients, where we have     \n     less access to information and influence regarding         \n     individual projects. While banks do not have the same      \n     project-level leverage in general corporate finance, Citi  \n     still reviews and engages clients when Indigenous Peoples  \n     risks or other Areas of High Caution are present across    \n     operations.                                                \n     Although Citi has only a general corporate purposes        \n     financing relationship with Enbridge, we have engaged      \n     with Enbridge over the past year, and regularly for        \n     years, on their environmental impact analysis, community   \n  \u00d8  consultation, Indigenous Peoples\u2019 engagement and cultural  \n     heritage policies and processes to evaluate                \n     implementation of responsible practices. We believe that   \n     they employ a number of industry-leading practices, which  \n     are transparently detailed on their own website for        \n     stakeholder review.                                        \n     In 2007, Citi became the first major U.S. bank to publish  \n     a Statement on Human Rights which publicly affirms its     \n     commitment to respecting the fundamental human rights in   \n  \u00d8  the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the          \n     International Labour Organization core conventions as      \n     well as supporting the United Nations Guiding Principles   \n     on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles).

In this      \n     reporting, which is part of our annual ESG Report, Citi    \n     describes our salient human rights risks, which            \n  \u00d8  stakeholders could be impacted by these risks, and how     \n     these risks are incorporated as \u201cAreas of High Caution\u201d    \n     in our ESRM Policy to trigger additional due diligence     \n     for transactions and regular reviews of client             \n     relationships. Finally, we provide details on how we       \n     screen applicable transactions for human rights risks and  \n     the steps we take to mitigate them.                        \n     We acknowledge our responsibility to respect human rights  \n     as described in the UN Guiding Principles. To implement    \n     this, Citi follows leading financial sector good practice  \n     in evaluating potential Indigenous Peoples risks or other  \n     human rights risks in client relationships and engaging    \n     our clients when risks are identified. These efforts help  \n     Citi to fulfill our responsibility to respect human        \n  \u00d8  rights and to support our clients\u2019 respect for human       \n     rights, including the rights of Indigenous Peoples. Due    \n     to Citi\u2019s ongoing efforts to implement industry good       \n     practice in human rights due diligence and provide robust  \n     disclosure on our human rights risks and our policies and  \n     practices to address those risks, Citi believes that it    \n     has substantially fulfilled the primary concerns outlined  \n     in the Proposal.                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  The                                                           \n  report requested by the Proposal is unnecessary as our        \n  current practices and reporting effectively address the       \n  primary concerns outlined                                     \n  in the Proposal; therefore, the Board recommends that you     \n  vote AGAINST this Proposal 8.                                 \n                                                                \nProposal 9\n\nHarrington Investments, Inc. has submitted the following\nproposal for consideration at the 2023 Annual Meeting.\n\nWhereas: Climate change poses a systemic\nrisk, with estimated global GDP loss of 11-14 percent by\nmidcentury under current trajectories. The climate crisis is\nprimarily\ncaused by fossil fuel production and combustion, enabled by\nfunding from financial institutions.\n\nAccording to scientific consensus, limiting warming\nto 1 .5\u00b0C means the world cannot develop new oil and gas fields\nor coal mines beyond those already approved (new fossil fuel\nexploration\nand development). Furthermore, existing fossil fuel supplies are\nsufficient to satisfy global energy needs. New\noil and gas fields would not produce in time to mitigate current\nenergy market turmoil resulting from the Ukraine War.\n\nCitigroup (Citi) committed to align financing with\nthe Paris Agreement goals, achieving net zero by 2050,\nconsistent with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. However,\nCiti\u2019s current policies and practices are not net zero aligned.\n\nCiti is the world\u2019s second largest fossil\nfuel funder, providing $285 billion in lending and underwriting\nto fossil fuel companies during 2016-2021, including $104\nbillion to 100\ntop companies engaged in new fossil fuel exploration and\ndevelopment. Citi\u2019s existing commitments do not equate to\nalignment:\nunder its 2030 absolute emissions target for energy, Citi can\ncontinue to finance new fossil fuel exploration and development,\nlocking\nin future emissions and increasing stranded asset risk.\n\nWithout a policy to phase out financing of new fossil\nfuel exploration and development, Citi is unlikely to meet its\nclimate commitments and merits scrutiny for material risks that\nmay include:\n                                                                \n     Greenwashing: Banking and securities regulators are        \n  \u2022  tightening and enforcing greenwashing regulations, which   \n     could result in major fines and settlements.8              \n     Regulation: Central banks, including the Fed, are          \n  \u2022  starting to implement climate stress tests9 and scenario   \n     analyses,10 and some have proposed increased capital       \n     requirements for

significant negative impacts -\nincluding physical and transition risks.\n\nBest practices for banks to achieve net zero involve\nfinancing of companies reducing scopes 1-3 absolute emissions\nand allocating capital in line with science based, independently\nverified\nshort, medium and long term decarbonization targets.\nOrganizations like the Science Based Targets initiative and\nTransition

projects and companies engaging in new fossil\nfuel exploration and development.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, Citi made a commitment to net zero emissions\nby 2050, and in January 2022 Citi published its 2021 Taskforce\non Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report,\nincluding climate\nscience-based 2030 emissions reduction targets for its Energy\nand Power loan portfolios. The Energy target \u2013 an absolute\nemissions\nreduction target of 29% \u2013 was developed using the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario, and the\nPower target \u2013 an intensity target of 63% -- was developed using\nthe IEA Sustainable Development Scenario OECD pathway. Both\nscenarios\nare net zero aligned. Most recently, in February 2023 Citi\npublished its 2022 TCFD Report, which included additional 2030\ntargets for\nits loan portfolios.\n\nA timebound commitment to phase out fossil fuels,\nwithout ensuring continued access to energy, could lead to a\ndisorderly transition that fails to accommodate critical energy\nsecurity\nconsiderations and the workers and communities that could be\nharmed. Citi\u2019s aim is to support the energy transition by\nfocusing\non investing in clean energy technologies and helping our\nclients reduce their carbon footprints as they transition.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                              \n  130  Stockholder Proposals  \n                              \nOur climate strategy is about investment rather\nthan divestment and includes 1) our emissions targets for 2030\nacross the energy value chain; 2) our commitment to engage with\nour clients\nto help finance their transition; and 3) increased financing and\nsupport of climate solutions. All these actions are needed to\nensure\nthat the world\u2019s energy needs continue to be met while the\nsystem decarbonizes, and to ensure that Citi\u2019s actions do not\nresult\nmerely in clients shifting to financial institutions that lack\nsuch climate commitments.\nImportant Points to Consider:\n                                                                \n     Citi\u2019s commitment to net zero transition:                  \n     Citi continues to take concrete steps to develop its Net   \n     Zero Plan. Following our initial commitment to net zero    \n     GHG emissions by 2050 and net zero operations by 2030, in  \n     January 2022 Citi published its 2030 emissions targets     \n     for its Energy and Power portfolios, and in February       \n  \u00d8  2023, Citi published additional 2030 emissions targets.    \n     Our climate strategy combines our net zero targets with a  \n     focus on helping clients to transition, while also         \n     increasing our financing of climate solutions.             \n     Encouraging a responsible and orderly energy transition    \n     will enable Citi to better manage and reduce risks and to  \n     capitalize on opportunities in sustainable and transition  \n     finance.                                                   \n     Citi\u2019s engagement with clients:                            \n     Citi and many of its clients recognize the significance    \n     of the effort needed to address our global climate         \n     challenges. Many clients have committed or are expected    \n     to commit to plans and targets to decarbonize and          \n     transition their business models. Citi believes that it    \n  \u00d8  can support these clients and others as they make these    \n     fundamental shifts to their businesses in the coming       \n     years. The Proposal, however, assumes that terminating     \n     lending and underwriting relationships must be the         \n     primary strategy to fulfill the IEA\u2019s Net Zero Emissions   \n     by 2050 Roadmap, without full consideration of the         \n     climate and financial benefits of Citi\u2019s commitment to     \n     finance the transition.                                    \n     Environmental and Social Risk Management:                  \n     Citi has a long-standing Environmental and Social Risk     \n     Management (ESRM) Policy, which includes sector            \n     approaches for thermal coal mining and coal-fired power.   \n     Since establishing our net zero commitment, Citi has       \n  \u00d8  pivoted from a focus on ESRM sectoral policies to          \n     developing a robust client engagement and transition       \n     finance program combined with a data-driven                \n     decarbonization approach. We believe that this strategy    \n     will drive decarbonization of our loan portfolios,         \n     enhanced risk management, and value creation for our       \n     shareholders.                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s                                                        \n  climate actions over the past several years have included     \n  its net zero commitment and release of 2030 emissions         \n  reduction targets.                                            \n  Citi\u2019s Net Zero Plan, which it continues to update annually   \n  in its TCFD Report, reflects the level of quantitative and    \n  science-based                                                 \n  analysis necessary to manage these loan portfolios to net     \n  zero emissions, will help Citi to better understand and       \n  manage climate-related                                        \n  risks, and will best position Citi to compete in the          \n  sustainable and transition finance markets.

Proposals for the 2024 Annual\nMeeting must be received no later\nthan November 16, 2023. The proposal and its proponent must\nsatisfy all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8.\n\nCiti\u2019s By-laws permit a stockholder or group\nof stockholders (up to 20) who have owned at least 3% of Citi\ncommon stock for at least three years to submit Director\nnominees (up to\nthe greater of two nominees or 20% of the Board, as determined\nin accordance with the By-laws) for inclusion in Citi\u2019s Proxy\nStatement\nif the nominating stockholder(s) satisfies the requirements\nspecified in the By-laws.

The notice must be delivered to, or mailed and\nreceived\nby, Citi\u2019s Corporate Secretary not earlier than October 17, 2023\nand not later than November 16, 2023. These deadlines are based\non the 150th day and 120th day, respectively, before the one-\nyear anniversary of the date that the Proxy Statement for this\nAnnual Meeting\nwas first sent to stockholders (which date, for purposes of\nCiti\u2019s By-laws, is March 15, 2023). The ability to include a\nnominee\nin Citi\u2019s Proxy Statement is subject to the terms and conditions\nset forth in Citi\u2019s By-laws.\n\nWith respect to stockholder nominees for Director\nelection at the next Annual Meeting (other than nominees\nsubmitted for inclusion in Citi\u2019s proxy materials) and\nstockholder proposals\nfor consideration at the next Annual Meeting that are not\nsubmitted for inclusion in Citi\u2019s proxy materials under Rule\n14a-8, written\nnotice of nominations and proposals must be provided by the\nstockholder proponent to Citi in accordance with Citi\u2019s By-laws.\nThe\nnotice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, Citi\u2019s\nCorporate Secretary, not earlier than December 27, 2023 and not\nlater\nthan January 26, 2024 and must comply with all applicable\nprovisions of Citi\u2019s By-laws.

In addition to soliciting proxies by\nmail, Citi may solicit proxies by personal interview, telephone,\nand similar means. No Director, officer, or employee of Citi\nwill be specially compensated for these activities. Citi also\nintends to\nrequest that brokers, banks, and other nominees solicit proxies\nfrom their principals and will pay the brokers, banks, and other\nnominees\ncertain expenses they incur for such activities. Citi has\nretained Morrow Sodali LLC, 333 Ludlow Street, 5th Floor, South\nTower, Stamford,\nCT 06902, a proxy soliciting firm, to assist in the solicitation\nof proxies, for an estimated fee of $30,000 plus reimbursement\nof certain\nout-of-pocket expenses.\n\nHouseholding\n\nUnder SEC rules, a single set of Annual Reports\nand Proxy Statements may be sent to any household at which two\nor more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the\nsame family.\nEach stockholder continues to receive a separate proxy card.\nThis procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the volume\nof duplicate\ninformation stockholders receive and reduces mailing and\nprinting expenses. In accordance with a notice sent to certain\nstockholders who\nshared a single address, only one Annual Report and Proxy\nStatement will be sent to that address unless any stockholder at\nthat address\nrequested multiple sets of documents be sent. However, if any\nstockholder who agreed to householding wishes to receive a\nseparate Annual\nReport or Proxy Statement, he or she may telephone toll-free\n1-866-540-7095 or write to Broadridge Financial Services, Inc.,\nHouseholding\nDepartment, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Stockholders\nsharing an address who wish to receive a single set of reports\nmay do so\nby contacting their banks or brokers, if they are beneficial\nholders, or by contacting Broadridge at the address set forth\nabove, if they\nare record holders.\n                                               www.citigroup.com\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                                      \n  132  About the 2023 Annual Meeting  \n                                      \nAbout the 2023 Annual Meeting\n                                                                \n  Q:    Who is soliciting my vote?                              \n        The Board of                                            \n  A:    Directors of Citigroup Inc. is soliciting your vote at  \n        the 2023 Annual Meeting of Citi\u2019s stockholders.         \n  Q:    Where and when will the 2023 Annual Meeting take        \n        place?                                                  \n        The Annual Meeting is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m.   \n        E.T. on April 25, 2023 through a virtual meeting        \n        platform.

If you are a registered         \n        stockholder and would like your vote                    \n        kept confidential, please check the appropriate box on  \n        the proxy card or follow the instructions when          \n        submitting your vote by telephone,                      \n  A:    mobile phone, QR Code or by Internet.

If a stockholder proposal that was excluded      \n        from this Proxy Statement is brought before the         \n  A:    meeting, the Chair will declare such proposal out of    \n        order, and it will be disregarded, or we will vote the  \n        proxies AGAINST the proposal. If any other matters      \n        arise at the Annual Meeting that are properly           \n        presented at the meeting, the proxies will be voted at  \n        the discretion of the proxy holders.                    \n  Q:    What happens if the meeting is postponed or adjourned   \n        or encounters technical difficulties?                   \n        Your proxy will still be good and may be voted at the   \n        postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still be able  \n        to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted. If    \n  A:    there are any technical issues in convening or hosting  \n        the meeting, information on when and how the meeting    \n        will be reconvened will be displayed during the         \n        scheduled time of the meeting on the Virtual Meeting    \n        Platform.                                               \n  Q:    Should I register to attend the 2023 Annual Meeting?    \n        Yes.

Any assertion by an Employee that any term, condition,\nlimitation,\nor restriction of the Award as specified in the Award Agreement\nis invalid or not binding on such Employee because of his or her\nnon-acceptance\nof the Award Agreement (or any portion thereof) shall be deemed\na refusal of the Award and the Employee shall cease to be a\nParticipant\nwith respect to the Award, which shall be immediately cancelled.\nEach Award Agreement shall provide for forfeiture or\ncancellation of\nunvested Awards if it is determined that a Participant engaged\nin Gross Misconduct on or prior to a vesting date.\n\n13.

The Company and its\nSubsidiaries\nshall have the right to require payment of, or may deduct from\nany payment made under the Plan or otherwise to a Participant,\nor may permit\nor require shares to be tendered or sold (including shares of\nCommon Stock delivered or vested in connection with an Award) in\nan amount\nsufficient to cover withholding of, any federal, state, local,\nforeign, or other governmental taxes or charges required by law,\nor hypothetical\ntaxes required to be paid by a Participant pursuant to a tax-\nequalization policy for expatriate employees, and to take such\nother action\nas may be necessary to satisfy any such withholding or payment\nobligations. The value of any shares allowed to be withheld or\ntendered\nfor tax withholding may not exceed the amount allowed consistent\nwith fixed plan accounting in accordance with GAAP, to the\nextent applicable.\nTo the extent that a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient\nto satisfy a tax withholding obligation of the Company may not\nbe withheld\n(whether because the Award has not vested in full pursuant to\nits terms, administrative procedures in effect at such time,\napplicable\naccounting principles, or any other reason), it shall be a\ncondition to the obligation of the Company to issue shares of\nCommon Stock\nupon the exercise of an Option or a SAR, or in settlement of any\nvested Award, that a Participant pay to the Company, on demand,\n\nCiti 2023 Proxy Statement\n                     \n  Table of Contents  \n                     \n                \n  Annex B  151  \n                \nsuch amount as may be requested by the Company for\nthe purpose of satisfying any actual tax withholding (or\nhypothetical tax) liability.

If, pursuant to any Award that is\nsubject to Section\n409A of the Code, a Participant is entitled to receive a payment\non a specified date, such payment shall be deemed made as of\nsuch specified\ndate if it is made (a) not earlier than 30 days before such\nspecified date, and (b) not later than December 31 of the year\nin which such\nspecified date occurs or, if later, the fifteenth day of the\nthird month following such specified date; provided that the\nParticipant\nshall not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the\ntaxable year in which such payment is made.
