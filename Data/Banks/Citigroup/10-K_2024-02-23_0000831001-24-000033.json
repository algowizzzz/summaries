The\nincrease in revenues was\npartially offset by lower non-\ninterest revenues, primarily\ndriven by approximately $1.9\nbillion in aggregate\ntranslation losses (including\napproximately $880 million in\nthe fourth quarter) due to\ndevaluations of the Argentine\npeso during the year, the\nimpact of lower volatility in\nMarkets and the contraction of\nthe global investment banking\nwallet in Investment Banking.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses increased\n10% versus the prior year. The\nincrease included fourth-\nquarter pretax charges of\napproximately $1.7 billion\nassociated with the FDIC\nspecial assessment and\napproximately $780 million of\nrestructuring charges.\nExcluding both of these\ncharges, expenses increased\n5%, driven by increased\ninvestments in other risk and\ncontrols and technology,\nelevated business-as-usual\nseverance costs and additional\ntransformation and business-\nled investments. The increase\nwas partially offset by\nproductivity savings and\nexpense reductions from the\nexited markets and continued\nwind-downs (see \u201cExpenses\u201d\nbelow).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s cost of credit was\n$9.2 billion versus $5.2\nbillion in the prior year. The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby higher cards net credit\nlosses in Branded Cards and\nRetail Services, reflecting\nnormalization from\nhistorically low levels. The\nincrease was also due to net\nbuilds in the allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL), including\napproximately $1.9 billion in\nbuilds related to increases in\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures in Russia and\nArgentina (including\napproximately $1.3 billion in\nthe fourth quarter), as well\nas builds due to volume growth\nin Branded Cards and Retail\nServices.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $6.1 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends ($4.1\nbillion) and share repurchases\n($2.0 billion).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) Capital ratio under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach increased to 13.4% as\nof December 31, 2023, compared\nto 13.0% as of December 31,\n2022 (see \u201cCapital Resources\u201d\nbelow). This compares to\nCiti\u2019s required regulatory\nCET1 Capital ratio of 12.3% as\nof October 1, 2023 under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach.\n\n\u2022 Citi closed the four\nremaining signed consumer\nbanking sale transactions in\n2023.

Net\nincome decreased 38% versus\nthe prior year, driven by the\nhigher expenses, the higher\ncost of credit and a higher\neffective tax rate, partially\noffset by the higher revenues.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nwas 27% in 2023 versus 19% in\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby the geographic mix of\nearnings (see Note 10).\n\nAs discussed above, results\nfor 2023 included several\nnotable items impacting pretax\nrevenues, expenses and cost of\ncredit:\n\n\u2022 Approximately $1.9 billion\nof aggregate translation\nlosses in revenues due to\ndevaluations of the Argentine\npeso\n\n\u2022 Approximately $1.9 billion\nin aggregate reserve builds\nrelated to increases in\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures in Russia and\nArgentina, driven by safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law\n\n\u2022 An approximate $1.7 billion\ncharge to operating expenses\nrelated to the FDIC special\nassessment in the fourth\nquarter\n\n\u2022 Approximately $780 million\nof restructuring charges in\nthe fourth quarter, recorded\nin operating expenses in\nCorporate/Other within All\nOther (managed basis), related\nto actions taken as part of\nCiti\u2019s organizational\nsimplification initiatives\n\nIn total, on an after-tax\nbasis the notable items were\n$(5.4) billion.\n\nAdditionally, results for 2023\nincluded pretax divestiture-\nrelated impacts of\napproximately $1.0 billion\n(approximately $659 million\nafter-tax), primarily driven\nby gains on sale of Citi\u2019s\nIndia and Taiwan consumer\nbanking businesses. (See \u201c All\nOther \u2014Divestiture-Related\nImpacts (Reconciling Items)\u201d\nbelow.)\n\nThe above notable items and\ndivestiture-related impacts,\ncollectively, had a $2.40\nnegative impact on EPS in\n2023.

(See \u201c\nAll Other \u2014Divestiture-Related\nImpacts (Reconciling Items)\u201d\nbelow.) Collectively,\ndivestiture-related impacts\nhad a $0.09 negative impact on\n                               6                                \nEPS. Excluding divestiture-\nrelated impacts, EPS in 2022\nwas $7.09. Results in 2022\nalso included approximately\n$820 million of translation\nlosses in revenues due to the\ndevaluations of the Argentine\npeso.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $78.5\nbillion in 2023 increased 4%\non a reported basis. Excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts,\nrevenues of $77.1 billion also\nincreased 4% versus the prior\nyear. Excluding both\ndivestiture-related and\nArgentine peso devaluation\nimpacts, revenues of $79\nbillion in 2023 increased 5%\nversus the prior year. The\nincrease in revenues reflected\nstrength across Services and\nUSPB , partially offset by\ndeclines in Markets , Banking\nand Wealth , as well as the\nrevenue reduction from the\nexited markets and continued\nwind-downs in All Other\n(managed basis).\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $689 billion, up 5%\nversus the prior year, largely\ndriven by growth in USPB .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were approximately\n$1.3 trillion, down 4% versus\nthe prior year. The decline in\ndeposits was largely due to a\nreduction in Services ,\nreflecting quantitative\ntightening and a shift of\ndeposits to higher-yielding\ninvestments in USPB and Wealth\nin 2023.

In the\nfourth quarter of 2023, Citi\nincurred the approximate $1.7\nbillion charge associated with\nthe FDIC special assessment\nand approximately $780 million\nof restructuring charges\nrelated to Citi\u2019s\norganizational simplification\ninitiatives (see Note 9).\nExpenses also included\ndivestiture-related impacts of\n$372 million in 2023 and $696\nmillion in the prior year.\nExcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts, expenses of $56\nbillion increased 11% versus\nthe prior year. Excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts,\nthe restructuring charges and\nthe FDIC special assessment,\nexpenses of $53.5 billion\nincreased 6%, driven by\nincreased investments in other\nrisk and controls and\ntechnology, elevated business-\nas-usual severance costs and\nadditional transformation and\nbusiness-led investments. The\nincrease was partially offset\nby productivity savings and\nexpense reductions from the\nexited markets and continued\nwind-downs in Legacy\nFranchises (managed basis)\nwithin All Other (managed\nbasis). Citi expects to incur\nadditional costs related to\nits organizational\nsimplification in the first\nquarter of 2024.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $9.2\nbillion, compared to $5.2\nbillion in the prior year. The\nincrease was driven by higher\nnet credit losses in Branded\nCards and Retail Services,\nreflecting the normalization\nto pre-pandemic levels at the\nend of 2023, and net builds in\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses (ACL), including\napproximately $1.9 billion\nrelated to increases in\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures in Russia and\nArgentina (approximately $1.3\nbillion in the fourth\nquarter), as well as builds\ndue to volume growth in\nBranded Cards and Retail\nServices.

Consumer net\ncredit losses of $6.2 billion\nincreased 71%, largely\nreflecting the rise in cards\nnet credit loss rates from\nhistorically low levels.\nCorporate net credit losses\nincreased to $250 million from\n$178 million.\n\nCiti expects to incur higher\nnet credit losses in 2024,\nprimarily due to higher cards\nnet credit loss rates, which\nCiti expects to rise above\npre-pandemic levels and, on a\nfull-year basis, peak in 2024.\nThe higher net credit losses\nexpectation is already\nreflected in the Company\u2019s ACL\non loans for outstanding\nbalances at December 31, 2023.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 13.4% as of December 31,\n2023, compared to 13.0% as of\nDecember 31, 2022, based on\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets (RWA). The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby net income, impacts from\nthe sales of certain Asia\nconsumer banking (Asia\nConsumer) businesses and\nbeneficial net movements in\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (AOCI) ,\npartially offset by the\npayment of common dividends,\nshare repurchases and an\nincrease in RWA.\n\nIn 2023, Citi repurchased $2.0\nbillion of common shares and\npaid $4.1 billion of common\ndividends (see \u201cUnregistered\nSales of Equity Securities,\nRepurchases of Equity\nSecurities and Dividends\u201d\nbelow).

Services expenses of\n$10.0 billion increased 15%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in technology and\nother risk and controls,\nvolume-related expenses and\nbusiness-led investments in\nTreasury and Trade Solutions\n(TTS), partially offset by the\nimpact of productivity\nsavings. Cost of credit\nincreased to $950 million from\n$207 million the prior year,\nlargely driven by an ACL build\nin other assets, primarily due\nto the reserve build for\nincreases in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures in\nRussia and Argentina.\n                               7                                \nServices revenues of $18.1\nbillion increased 16%, driven\nby net interest income growth\nof 28%, partially offset by an\n8% decrease in non-interest\nrevenue due to the impact of\nthe Argentine peso\ndevaluations (approximately\n$1.2 billion in 2023 and\napproximately $0.4 billion in\n2022). Excluding this impact,\nnon-interest revenue increased\n6%.\n\nTTS revenues of $13.6 billion\nincreased 16%, driven by 25%\ngrowth in net interest income,\npartially offset by an 11%\ndecrease in non-interest\nrevenue due to the impact of\nthe Argentine peso\ndevaluations. The increase in\nTTS net interest income was\nprimarily driven by higher\ninterest rates and cost of\nfunds management across\ncurrencies, as well as growth\nin deposits. Excluding the\nimpact of the currency\ndevaluations, non-interest\nrevenue increased 10%, driven\nby continued growth in\nunderlying drivers.\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nof $4.4 billion increased 15%,\nas net interest income grew\n46%, partially offset by a 5%\ndecrease in non-interest\nrevenue due to the impact of\nthe Argentine peso\ndevaluations. The increase in\nnet interest income was driven\nby higher interest rates\nacross currencies and cost of\nfunds management, partially\noffset by lower average\ndeposits.\n\nExcluding the impact of the\ncurrency devaluations, non-\ninterest revenue increased 1%,\ndriven by increased fees from\nhigher AUC/AUA balances from\nnew client business and\ndeepening share of existing\nclient wallet, as well as\ncontinued elevated levels of\ncorporate activity in Issuer\nServices.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nServices in 2023, see \u201c\nServices \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Markets                                                       \n                                                                \nMarkets net income of $4.0\nbillion decreased 33%, driven\nby lower revenues, higher\nexpenses and higher cost of\ncredit. Markets expenses of\n$13.2 billion increased 7%,\nprimarily driven by\ninvestments in transformation,\ntechnology and other risk and\ncontrols, partially offset by\nproductivity savings. Cost of\ncredit increased to $437\nmillion from $155 million in\nthe prior year, driven by an\nACL build in other assets,\nlargely due to the reserve\nbuild for increases in\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures in Russia and\nArgentina.\n\nMarkets revenues of $18.9\nbillion decreased 6%, driven\nby a 6% decrease in Fixed\nIncome markets and a 9%\ndecrease in Equity markets.\nThe decrease in Fixed Income\nwas driven by a decrease in\nrates and currencies and\nspread products reflecting\nlower volatility, the impact\nof the Argentine peso\ndevaluations, a strong prior-\nyear comparison and a\nsignificant slowdown in\nactivity in December 2023. The\ndecrease in Equity markets was\nprimarily due to a decline in\nequity derivatives, due to\nlower institutional activity,\nspread compression and lower\nvolatility.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nMarkets in 2023, see \u201c Markets\n\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Banking                                                       \n                                                                \nBanking reported a net loss of\n$48 million, compared to net\nincome of $386 million in the\nprior year, primarily driven\nby lower Corporate Lending\nrevenues, including the impact\nof a loss on loan hedges, and\nhigher expenses, partially\noffset by lower cost of\ncredit. Banking expenses of\n$4.9 billion increased 9%,\nprimarily driven by the\nabsence of an\n\noperational loss reserve\nrelease in the prior year,\nbusiness-led investments and\nthe impact of business-as-\nusual severance, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings. Cost of credit was a\nbenefit of $165 million,\ncompared to cost of credit of\n$549 million in the prior\nyear, driven by ACL releases\nin loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments, partially offset\nby an ACL build in other\nassets.\n\nBanking revenues of $4.6\nbillion decreased 15%,\nincluding the $443 million\nloss on loan hedges in 2023\nand the $307 million gain on\nloan hedges in the prior year.\nExcluding the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges, Banking revenues\nof $5.0 billion decreased 2%,\nas slightly higher revenues in\nInvestment Banking were more\nthan offset by lower Corporate\nLending revenues. Investment\nBanking revenues of $2.5\nbillion increased 1%, driven\nby lower markdowns in non-\ninvestment-grade loan\ncommitments. The increase in\nrevenue was largely offset by\nan overall decline in global\ninvestment banking wallet, as\nheightened macroeconomic\nuncertainty and volatility\ncontinued to impact client\nactivity. Excluding the impact\nof the gain (loss) on loan\nhedges, Corporate Lending\nrevenues decreased 4%, largely\ndriven by lower volumes on\ncontinued balance sheet\noptimization. The decline in\nrevenues also reflected\napproximately $134 million in\ntranslation losses in\nArgentina due to devaluations\nof the Argentine peso,\nincluding a $64 million\ntranslation loss in the fourth\nquarter of 2023.

USPB expenses\nincreased 3%, primarily driven\nby continued investments in\nother risk and controls and\ntechnology, business-led\ninvestments and business-as-\nusual severance costs,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings. Cost of\ncredit increased to $6.7\nbillion, compared to $3.4\nbillion in the prior year. The\nincrease was largely driven by\nhigher net credit losses and a\nhigher net ACL build,\nprimarily reflecting growth in\nloan balances in Branded Cards\nand Retail Services. Net\ncredit losses increased 79%,\nprimarily reflecting\nnormalization from\nhistorically low levels in\nU.S. cards, as net credit loss\nrates for both Branded Cards\nand Retail Services reached\npre-pandemic levels at the end\nof 2023.\n\nUSPB revenues of $19.2 billion\nincreased 14%, due to higher\nnet interest income (up 12%),\ndriven by strong loan growth\nand higher deposit spreads, as\nwell as higher non-interest\nrevenue (up 19%). Branded\nCards revenues of $10.0\nbillion increased 11%,\nprimarily driven by the higher\nnet interest income, as\naverage loans increased 13%.\nRetail Services revenues of\n$6.6 billion increased 21%,\nprimarily driven by the higher\nnet interest income from loan\ngrowth, as well as higher non-\ninterest revenue due to the\nlower partner payments, driven\nby higher net credit losses.\nRetail Banking revenues of\n$2.6 billion increased 6%,\nprimarily driven by higher\ndeposit spreads and mortgage\nloan growth, partially offset\nby the impact of the transfer\nof certain relationships and\nthe associated deposit\nbalances to Wealth .\n                               8                                \nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nUSPB in 2023, see \u201c U.S.\nPersonal Banking \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Wealth                                                        \n                                                                \nWealth net income of $346\nmillion decreased 64%,\nreflecting lower revenues and\nhigher expenses, partially\noffset by lower cost of\ncredit. Wealth expenses\nincreased 10% to $6.6 billion,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in other risk and\ncontrols and technology,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings and re-\npacing of strategic\ninvestments.

The\nhigher expenses and cost of\ncredit were partially offset\nby higher revenues and the\nprior-year release of\ncumulative translation\nadjustment (CTA) losses (net\nof hedges) from AOCI ,\nrecorded in revenues\n(approximately $140 million\npretax), and in discontinued\noperations (approximately $260\nmillion pretax), related to\nthe substantial liquidation of\na U.K. consumer legacy\noperation (see Note 2).\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nAll Other (managed basis) in\n2023, see \u201c All Other\n\u2014Divestiture-Related Impacts\n(Reconciling Items)\u201d and \u201c All\nOther (Managed Basis)\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties               \n                                                                \nVarious geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic and regulatory\nchallenges and uncertainties\ncontinue to adversely affect\neconomic conditions in the\nU.S. and globally, including,\namong others, continued\nelevated interest rates,\nelevated inflation, and\neconomic and geopolitical\nchallenges related to China,\nthe Russia\u2013Ukraine war and\nescalating conflicts in the\nMiddle East.

In the second\nquarter of 2021, Citi made an\ninitial submission to the OCC,\nand submitted its plans to\naddress the consent orders to\nboth regulators during the\nthird quarter of 2021. Citi\ncontinues to work\nconstructively with the\nregulators and provides to\nboth regulators on an ongoing\nbasis additional information\nregarding its plans and\nprogress. Citi will continue\nto reflect their feedback in\nits project plans and\nexecution efforts.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\nefforts include continued\ninvestments in its\ntransformation, including the\nremediation of its consent\norders. Citi\u2019s CEO has made\nthe strengthening of Citi\u2019s\nrisk and control environment a\nstrategic priority and has\nestablished a Chief Operating\nOfficer organization to\ncentralize program management.\nIn addition, the Citigroup and\nCitibank Boards of Directors\neach formed a Transformation\nOversight Committee, an ad hoc\ncommittee of each Board, to\nprovide oversight of\nmanagement\u2019s remediation\nefforts under the consent\norders. The Citi Board of\nDirectors has determined that\nCiti\u2019s plans are responsive to\nthe Company\u2019s objectives and\nthat progress continues to be\nmade on execution of the\nplans.\n\nFor

revenues in both TTS\nand Securities Services,\nlargely driven by net interest\nincome growth, partially\noffset by lower non-interest\nrevenue due to the impact of\nthe Argentine peso\ndevaluations.\n\nTTS revenues increased 16%,\nreflecting 25% growth in net\ninterest income, partially\noffset by an 11% decrease in\nnon-interest revenue. The\nincrease in net interest\nincome was primarily driven by\nhigher interest rates and cost\nof funds management across\ncurrencies as well as growth\nin deposits. Average deposits\nincreased 2%, largely driven\nby growth in international\nmarkets. The decrease in non-\ninterest revenue was driven by\napproximately $1.0 billion in\ntranslation losses in revenues\nin Argentina due to\ndevaluations of the Argentine\npeso, including a $0.5 billion\ntranslation loss in the fourth\nquarter of 2023. Excluding\nthese translation losses, non-\ninterest revenue grew 10%,\nreflecting continued growth in\nunderlying drivers, including\nhigher cross-border flows (up\n15%), U.S. dollar clearing\nvolumes (up 6%) and commercial\ncard spend (up 16%).\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nincreased 15%, as net interest\nincome grew 46%, driven by\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies and cost of funds\nmanagement, partially offset\nby the impact of an 8% decline\nin average deposits and lower\nnon-interest revenue. The\ndecline in average deposits\nlargely reflected the impact\nof monetary tightening. The\ndecrease in non-interest\nrevenue was driven by\napproximately $0.2 billion in\ntranslation losses in revenues\nin Argentina due to the\nArgentine peso devaluations,\nincluding a $0.1 billion\ntranslation loss in the fourth\nquarter of 2023. The decline\nin non-interest revenues was\npartially offset by increased\nfees from higher AUC/AUA\nbalances from new client\nbusiness and deepening share\nof existing client wallet, as\nwell as continued elevated\nlevels of corporate activity\nin Issuer Services.\n\nExpenses were up 15%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in technology and\nother risk and controls,\nvolume-related expenses and\nbusiness-led investments in\nTTS, partially offset by the\nimpact of productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions were $950 million,\ncompared to $207 million in\nthe prior year, primarily\ndriven by an ACL build in\nother assets.\n\nThe net ACL build was $910\nmillion, compared to $156\nmillion in the prior year,\nprimarily due to an ACL build\nin other assets related to\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures in Russia and\nArgentina, driven by safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law.

The increase in net\ninterest income was also\ndriven by the benefits from\nhigher interest rates, balance\nsheet optimization, higher\n                               15                               \naverage deposits and higher\naverage loans. Average\ndeposits grew 1%, as volume\ngrowth was partially offset by\nthe impact of foreign exchange\ntranslation. Average loans\ngrew 11%, primarily driven by\nthe strength in trade flows in\nInternational, partially\noffset by loan sales in North\nAmerica.\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nincreased 14%, primarily\ndriven by an increase in net\ninterest income, reflecting\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies as well as the\nimpact of foreign exchange\ntranslation. Non-interest\nrevenues decreased 4%, due to\nthe impact of foreign exchange\ntranslation and lower fees in\nthe custody business due to\nlower AUC/AUA (decline of 6%),\ndriven by declines in global\nfinancial markets. The decline\nin non-interest revenues was\npartially offset by continued\nelevated levels of corporate\nactivity in Issuer Services\nand new client onboarding of\n$1.2 trillion in AUC/AUA.\nAverage deposits declined 1%,\ndue to clients seeking higher\nrate alternatives.\n\nExpenses were up 13%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in Citi\u2019s\ntechnology and other risk and\ncontrols, volume-related\nexpenses and business-led\ninvestments in TTS.\n\nProvisions were $207 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $263\nmillion in the prior year,\ndriven by an ACL build on\nloans and unfunded lending\ncommitments.\n\nThe ACL build was $156\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $305 million in the prior\nyear.

The range of services includes market-\nmaking across asset classes, risk management solutions,\nfinancing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and\nsettlement.\n\nAs a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including\nholding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the\ndifferential between the price at which it buys and sells the\nproducts. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and\nlosses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions .\nOther primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-\nfor-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity\nsecurities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring\ngains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less\ninterest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding\ntransactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest\nincome.\n\nThe amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a\nvariety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity;\nchanges in market variables such as interest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor\nconfidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues\ninclude revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue\nsharing arrangement with Banking \u2014Corporate Lending for\nInvestment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to\nCorporate Lending clients.\n\nAssuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in\nclient activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in\nincreases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can\nsignificantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads\nand the fair value of product inventory. Management of the\nMarkets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of\nthe above factors.\n\nMarkets international presence is supported by trading floors in\napproximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95\ncountries and jurisdictions.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n

used to economically hedge a portion\nof the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans\nand loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on loan hedges includes the\nmark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by\nthe mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at\nfair value. Hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market\non credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate\nloan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium costs of these hedges\nare netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the\ncost of credit protection.

The\nincrease in revenue was mainly\noffset by the overall decline\nin market wallet, as\nheightened macroeconomic\nuncertainty and volatility\ncontinued to impact client\nactivity. Advisory fees\ndecreased 24%, primarily\ndriven by a decline in the\nmarket wallet. Equity\nunderwriting fees decreased\n19%, driven by overall\nsoftness in equity issuance\nactivity. Debt underwriting\nfees increased 9%, driven by\nincreased client activity,\npartially offset by a decline\nin the market wallet.\n\nCorporate Lending revenues\ndecreased 30%, including the\nimpact of gain (loss) on loan\nhedges. Excluding the impact\nof gain (loss) on loan hedges,\nrevenues decreased 4%, largely\ndriven by lower volumes on\ncontinued balance sheet\noptimization. The decline in\nrevenues also reflected\napproximately $134 million in\ntranslation losses in non-\ninterest revenue in Argentina\ndue to devaluations of the\nArgentine peso, including a\n$64 million translation loss\nin the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nExpenses were up 9%, primarily\ndriven by the absence of an\noperational loss reserve\nrelease in the prior year,\nbusiness-led investments and\nthe impact of business-as-\nusual severance, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $165 million, compared to a\ncost of $549 million in the\nprior year, driven by ACL\nreleases in loans and unfunded\nlending commitments, partially\noffset by an ACL build in\nother assets.\n\nNet credit losses increased to\n$169 million, compared to $106\nmillion in the prior year,\ndriven by higher episodic\nwrite-offs.\n\nThe net ACL release was $334\nmillion, compared to a net\nbuild of $443 million in the\nprior year. The ACL releases\nin loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments were driven by an\nimproved macroeconomic\noutlook. These releases were\npartially offset by an ACL\nbuild in other assets,\nprimarily related to transfer\nrisk associated with exposures\nin Argentina and Russia,\ndriven by safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law.

billion,\ncompared to $2.8 billion in\nthe prior year, reflecting\nhigher cost of credit and\nhigher expenses, partially\noffset by higher revenues.\n\nRevenues increased 14%, due to\nhigher net interest income (up\n12%), driven by strong loan\ngrowth and higher deposit\nspreads, as well as higher\nnon-interest revenue (up 19%).\nThe increase in non-interest\nrevenue was largely driven by\nlower partner payments in\nRetail Services, due to higher\nnet credit losses, and an\nincrease in interchange fees,\ndriven by higher card spend\nvolumes in Branded Cards. The\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue was partially offset\nby an increase in rewards\ncosts in Branded Cards, driven\nby the higher card spend\nvolumes.\n\nCards revenues increased 15%.\nBranded Cards revenues\nincreased 11%, primarily\ndriven by the higher net\ninterest income, reflecting\nthe strong loan growth.\nBranded Cards new account\nacquisitions increased 9% and\ncard spend volumes increased\n5%. Branded Cards average\nloans increased 13%,\nreflecting the higher card\nspend volumes and lower card\npayment rates.\n\nRetail Services revenues\nincreased 21%, primarily\ndriven by higher net interest\nincome on higher loan\nbalances, as well as higher\nnon-interest revenue due to\nthe lower partner payments,\ndriven by the higher net\ncredit losses (see Note 5).\nRetail Services credit card\nspend volumes decreased 4% and\naverage loans increased 9%,\nlargely reflecting lower card\npayment rates.\n\nRetail Banking revenues\nincreased 6%, primarily driven\nby higher deposit spreads and\nmortgage loan growth,\npartially offset by the impact\nof the transfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nWealth . Average mortgage\nloans increased 16%, primarily\ndriven by lower refinancings\ndue to high interest rates and\nhigher mortgage originations.\nAverage deposits decreased 4%,\nlargely reflecting the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nWealth .\n\nExpenses increased 3%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in other risk and\ncontrols, technology,\nbusiness-led investments and\nbusiness-as-usual severance\ncosts, partially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nProvisions were $6.7 billion,\ncompared to $3.4 billion in\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby higher net credit losses\nand a higher ACL build for\nloans. Net credit losses\nincreased 79%, primarily\nreflecting higher losses in\ncards in line with\n\nexpectations, with Branded\nCards net credit losses up 93%\nto $2.7 billion and Retail\nServices net credit losses up\n84% to $2.3 billion. Both\nBranded Cards and Retail\nServices net credit losses\nreached pre-pandemic levels at\nthe end of 2023.\n\nThe net ACL build was $1.5\nbillion, compared to $0.5\nbillion in the prior year,\nprimarily reflecting growth in\nloan balances in Branded Cards\nand Retail Services.

The increase\nin revenues was partially\noffset by lower non-interest\nrevenue, largely reflecting\nhigher partner payments in\nRetail Services resulting from\nhigher revenues.\n\nCards revenues increased 8%.\nBranded Cards revenues\nincreased 9%, primarily driven\nby higher net interest income\non higher loan balances.\nBranded Cards new account\nacquisitions increased 11% and\ncard spend volumes increased\n16%. Average loans increased\n11%, reflecting the higher\ncard spend volumes.\n\nRetail Services revenues\nincreased 7%, primarily driven\nby higher net interest income\non higher loan balances and\nlower card payment rates,\npartially offset by the\nincrease in partner payments.\nThe increase in partner\npayments reflected higher\nincome sharing as a result of\nhigher revenues. Retail\nServices card spend volumes\nincreased 8% and average loans\nincreased 6%, reflecting the\nhigher card spend volumes.\n\nRetail Banking revenues\ndecreased 2%, as the higher\ninterest rates and modest\ndeposit growth were more than\noffset by lower mortgage\nrevenues due to fewer mortgage\noriginations, driven by the\nhigher interest rates. Average\ndeposits increased 3%, largely\nreflecting higher levels of\nconsumer liquidity in the\nfirst half of 2022.\n\nExpenses increased 10%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, other risk and\ncontrol initiatives, volume-\nrelated expenses and business-\nled investments, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions were $3.4 billion,\ncompared to a benefit of $1.0\nbillion in the prior year,\nlargely driven by a net ACL\nbuild. Net credit losses\ndecreased 1%, driven by\nhistorically low loss rates\nexperienced in the first half\nof 2022, partially offset by\nhigher losses in the second\nhalf of the year, particularly\nin Retail Services (net credit\nlosses up 7% to $1.3 billion).\nBranded Cards net credit\nlosses declined 17% to $1.4\nbillion.\n\nThe net ACL build was $0.5\nbillion, compared to a net\nrelease of $3.9 billion in the\nprior year, primarily driven\nby U.S. cards loan growth and\na deterioration in\nmacroeconomic assumptions.\n                               24                               \n                                                                \n  WEALTH                                                        \n                                                                \nWealth includes Private Bank, Wealth at Work and Citigold and\nprovides financial services to a range of client segments\nincluding affluent, high net worth and ultra-high net worth\nclients through banking, lending, mortgages, investment, custody\nand trust product offerings in 20 countries, including the U.S.,\nMexico and four wealth management centers: Singapore, Hong Kong,\nthe UAE and London.

The higher net\ninterest income was primarily\ndue to higher interest rates\non deposits with banks and the\ninvestment portfolio,\npartially offset by higher\ncost of funds.\n\nExpenses increased 22%,\nprimarily driven by the $1.7\nbillion FDIC special\nassessment related to regional\nbank failures, restructuring\ncharges and higher business-\nas-usual severance costs,\npartially offset by lower\nconsulting expenses and lower\nexpenses in both wind-down and\nexit markets. The\nrestructuring charges were\nrecorded in the fourth quarter\nand primarily consisted of\nseverance costs associated\nwith headcount reductions\nrelated to the organizational\nsimplification initiatives\n(see Note 9).\n\nProvisions were $1.3 billion,\ncompared to $498 million in\nthe prior year, driven by a\nhigher net ACL build for loans\nand other assets and higher\nnet credit losses. Net credit\nlosses increased 13%,\nprimarily driven by higher\nlending volumes in Mexico\nConsumer.\n\nThe net ACL build for loans\nwas $106 million, compared to\na net release of $368 million\nin the prior year, primarily\ndriven by higher lending\nvolumes in Mexico Consumer.\nThe net ACL build in other\nassets was primarily due to\nthe reserve build for transfer\nrisk associated with exposures\nin Russia, driven by safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law.

The\nincrease in revenues was\npartially offset by a 1%\ndecrease in retail banking\nrevenues, primarily driven by\nlower fiduciary fees\nreflecting declines in equity\nmarket valuations.\n\nAsia Consumer (managed basis)\nrevenues decreased 25%,\nprimarily driven by the loss\nof revenues from the closing\nof the exit markets and the\nimpacts of the ongoing Korea\nwind-down.\n\nLegacy Holdings Assets\nrevenues of $(81) million\ndecreased from $186 million in\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby the CTA loss (net of\nhedges) recorded in AOCI , as\nwell as the continued wind-\ndown of Legacy Holdings\nAssets.\n\nCorporate/Other revenues were\n$1.5 billion, compared to $825\nmillion in the prior year,\ndriven by higher net interest\nincome, partially offset by\nlower non-interest revenue.\nThe higher net interest income\nwas primarily due to the\ninvestment portfolio driven by\nhigher balances, higher\ninterest rates and lower\nmortgage-backed securities\nprepayments, partially offset\nby higher cost of funds\nrelated to higher\ninstitutional certificates of\ndeposit. The lower non-\ninterest revenue was primarily\ndue to the absence of mark-to-\nmarket gains in the prior year\nas well as higher hedging\ncosts.\n\nExpenses decreased 2%,\nprimarily driven by lower\nconsulting expenses, the\nimpact of certain legal\nsettlements and lower expenses\nin both wind-down and exit\nmarkets.\n\nProvisions were $498 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $88\nmillion in the prior year,\nprimarily driven by a lower\nnet ACL release, partially\noffset by lower net credit\nlosses.

These rules establish\nan integrated capital adequacy\nframework, encompassing both\nrisk-based capital ratios and\nleverage ratios.\n                                                                \n  Risk-Based Capital Ratios                                     \n                                                                \nThe U.S. Basel III rules set\nforth the composition of\nregulatory capital (including\nthe application of regulatory\ncapital adjustments and\ndeductions), as well as two\ncomprehensive methodologies (a\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches) for\nmeasuring total risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nTotal risk-weighted assets\nunder the Standardized\nApproach include credit and\nmarket risk-weighted assets,\nwhich are generally prescribed\nsupervisory risk weights.\nTotal risk-weighted assets\nunder the Advanced Approaches,\nwhich are primarily model\nbased, include credit, market\nand operational risk-weighted\nassets. As a result, credit\nrisk-weighted assets\ncalculated under the Advanced\nApproaches are more risk\nsensitive than those\ncalculated under the\nStandardized Approach. Market\nrisk-weighted assets are\ncurrently calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis\nunder both the Standardized\nand Advanced Approaches. The\nStandardized Approach does not\ninclude operational risk-\nweighted assets.\n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, Citigroup is required\nto maintain several regulatory\ncapital buffers above the\nstated minimum capital\nrequirements to avoid certain\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments\nto executive officers.\nAccordingly, for the fourth\nquarter of 2023, Citigroup\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio was 12.3% under\nthe Standardized Approach\n(incorporating its Stress\nCapital Buffer of 4.3% and\nGSIB (Global Systemically\nImportant Bank) surcharge of\n3.5%) and 10.5% under the\nAdvanced Approaches (inclusive\nof the fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer and GSIB\nsurcharge of 3.5%).\n\nSimilarly, Citigroup\u2019s primary\nsubsidiary, Citibank, N.A.\n(Citibank), is required to\nmaintain minimum regulatory\ncapital ratios plus applicable\nregulatory buffers, as well as\nhold sufficient capital to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nunder the Prompt Corrective\nAction framework. In effect,\nCitibank\u2019s required CET1\nCapital ratio was 7.0% under\nboth the Standardized and\nAdvanced Approaches, which is\nthe sum of the minimum 4.5%\nCET1 requirement and a fixed\n2.5% Capital Conservation\nBuffer. For additional\ninformation, see \u201cRegulatory\nCapital Buffers\u201d and \u201cPrompt\nCorrective Action Framework\u201d\nbelow.\n\nFurther, the U.S. Basel III\nrules implement the \u201ccapital\nfloor provision\u201d of the Dodd-\nFrank Act (the so-called\n\u201cCollins Amendment\u201d), which\nrequires banking organizations\nto calculate \u201cgenerally\napplicable\u201d capital\nrequirements. As a result,\nCiti must calculate each of\nthe three risk-based capital\nratios (CET1 Capital, Tier 1\nCapital and Total Capital)\nunder both the Standardized\nApproach and the Advanced\nApproaches and comply with the\nmore binding of each of the\nresulting risk-based capital\nratios.\n                               31                               \n                                                                \n  Leverage Ratio                                                \n                                                                \nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, Citigroup is also\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nLeverage ratio of 4.0%.\nSimilarly, Citibank is\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nLeverage ratio of 5.0% to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nunder the Prompt Corrective\nAction framework. The Leverage\nratio, a non-risk-based\nmeasure of capital adequacy,\nis defined as Tier 1 Capital\nas a percentage of quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nless amounts deducted from\nTier 1 Capital.\n                                                                \n  Supplementary Leverage Ratio                                  \n                                                                \nCiti is also required to\ncalculate a Supplementary\nLeverage ratio (SLR), which\ndiffers from the Leverage\nratio by including certain\noff-balance sheet exposures\nwithin the denominator of the\nratio (Total Leverage\nExposure). The SLR represents\nend-of-period Tier 1 Capital\nto Total Leverage Exposure.\nTotal Leverage Exposure is\ndefined as the sum of (i) the\ndaily average of on-balance\nsheet assets for the quarter\nand (ii) the average of\ncertain off-balance sheet\nexposures calculated as of the\nlast day of each month in the\nquarter, less applicable Tier\n1 Capital deductions. Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations are required to\nmaintain a stated minimum SLR\nof 3.0%.\n\nFurther, U.S. GSIBs, including\nCitigroup, are subject to a\n2.0% leverage buffer in\naddition to the 3.0% stated\nminimum SLR requirement,\nresulting in a 5.0% SLR. If a\nU.S. GSIB fails to exceed this\nrequirement, it will be\nsubject to increasingly\nstringent restrictions\n(depending upon the extent of\nthe shortfall) on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary executive bonus\npayments.\n\nSimilarly, Citibank is\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nSLR of 6.0% to be considered\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the\nPrompt Corrective Action\nframework.\n\nRegulatory Capital\nTreatment\u2014Modified Transition\nof the Current Expected Credit\nLosses Methodology\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking\nagencies issued a final rule\nthat modified the regulatory\ncapital transition provision\nrelated to the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology. The rule does not\nhave any impact on U.S. GAAP\naccounting.\n\nThe rule permitted banks to\ndelay for two years the \u201cDay\nOne\u201d adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology on January 1, 2020\nuntil January 1, 2022,\nfollowed by a three-year\ntransition to phase out the\nregulatory capital benefit\nprovided by the delay.\n\nIn addition, for the ongoing\nimpact of CECL, the agencies\nutilized a 25% scaling factor\nas an approximation of the\nincreased reserve build under\nCECL compared to the previous\nincurred loss model and,\ntherefore, allowed banks to\nadd back to CET1 Capital an\namount equal to 25% of the\nchange in CECL-based\nallowances in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022, the\ncumulative 25% change in CECL-\nbased allowances between\nJanuary 1, 2020 and December\n31, 2021 started to be phased\nin to regulatory capital (i)\nat 25% per year on January 1\nof each year over the three-\nyear transition period and\n(ii) along with the delayed\nDay One impact.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank elected\nthe modified CECL transition\nprovision provided by the\nrule. Accordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from adoption of\n\nthe CECL methodology, as well\nas the ongoing adjustments for\n25% of the change in CECL-\nbased allowances in each\nquarter between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021,\nstarted to be phased in on\nJanuary 1, 2022 and will be\nfully reflected in Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital as of\nJanuary 1, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023,\nCitigroup\u2019s reported\nStandardized Approach CET1\nCapital ratio of 13.4%\nbenefited from the deferrals\nof the CECL transition\nprovision by 16 basis points.\nFor additional information on\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital ratios\nexcluding the impact of the\nCECL transition provision, see\n\u201cCapital Resources (Full\nAdoption of CECL)\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Buffers                                    \n                                                                \nCitigroup and Citibank are\nrequired to maintain several\nregulatory capital buffers\nabove the stated minimum\ncapital requirements.

Citi\u2019s required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nunder the Advanced Approaches\n(using the fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer) remains\nunchanged at 10.5%. The SCB\napplies to Citigroup only; the\nregulatory capital framework\n                               32                               \napplicable to Citibank,\nincluding the Capital\nConservation Buffer, is\nunaffected by Citigroup\u2019s SCB.\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer Citigroup is subject to\na fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer under the\nAdvanced Approaches. Citibank\nis subject to the fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nunder both the Advanced\nApproaches and the\nStandardized Approach. In\naddition, Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations, such as\nCitigroup and Citibank, are\nsubject to a discretionary\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer. The Countercyclical\nCapital Buffer is currently\nset at 0% by the U.S. banking\nagencies. GSIB Surcharge The\nFRB imposes a risk-based\ncapital surcharge upon U.S.\nbank holding companies that\nare identified as GSIBs,\nincluding Citi (for\ninformation on potential\nchanges to the GSIB surcharge,\nsee \u201cRegulatory Capital\nStandards and Developments\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisks\u201d below). The GSIB\nsurcharge augments the SCB,\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand, if invoked, any\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer. A U.S. bank holding\ncompany that is designated a\nGSIB is required, on an annual\nbasis, to calculate a\nsurcharge using two methods\nand is subject to the higher\nof the resulting two\nsurcharges. The first method\n(\u201cmethod 1\u201d) is based on the\nBasel Committee\u2019s GSIB\nmethodology. Under the second\nmethod (\u201cmethod 2\u201d), the\nsubstitutability category\nunder the Basel Committee\u2019s\nGSIB methodology is replaced\nwith a quantitative measure\nintended to assess a GSIB\u2019s\nreliance on short-term\nwholesale funding. In\naddition, method 1\nincorporates relative measures\nof systemic importance across\ncertain global banking\norganizations and a year-end\nspot foreign exchange rate,\nwhereas method 2 uses fixed\nmeasures of systemic\nimportance and application of\nan average foreign exchange\nrate over a three-year period.\nThe GSIB surcharges calculated\nunder both method 1 and method\n2 are based on measures of\nsystemic importance from the\nyear immediately preceding\nthat in which the GSIB\nsurcharge calculations are\nbeing performed (e.g., the\nmethod 1 and method 2 GSIB\nsurcharges calculated during\n2024 will be based on 2023\nsystemic indicator data).\nGenerally, Citi\u2019s surcharge\ndetermined under method 2 will\nbe higher than its surcharge\ndetermined under method 1.\nShould a GSIB\u2019s systemic\nimportance change year-over-\nyear, such that it becomes\nsubject to a higher GSIB\nsurcharge, the higher\nsurcharge would become\neffective on January 1 of the\nyear that is one full calendar\nyear after the increased GSIB\nsurcharge was calculated\n(e.g., a higher surcharge\ncalculated in 2024 using data\nas of December 31, 2023 would\nnot become effective until\nJanuary 1, 2026). However, if\na GSIB\u2019s systemic importance\nchanges such that the GSIB\nwould be subject to a lower\nsurcharge, the GSIB would be\nsubject to the lower surcharge\non January 1 of the year\nimmediately following the\ncalendar year in which the\ndecreased GSIB surcharge was\ncalculated (e.g., a lower\nsurcharge calculated in 2024\nusing data as of December 31,\n2023 would become effective\nJanuary 1, 2025).\n\nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s effective GSIB\nsurcharge as determined under\nmethod 1 and method 2 during\n2023 and 2022:\n                                  \n              2023       2022     \n  Method 1     2.0  %     2.0  %  \n  Method 2     3.5        3.0     \n                                  \nCiti\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective during 2023 was 3.5%\nand during 2022 was 3.0%, as\nderived under the higher\nmethod 2 result. Citi\u2019s GSIB\nsurcharge effective for 2024\nremains unchanged at 3.5%, as\nderived under the higher\nmethod 2 result. Citi expects\nthat its method 2 GSIB\nsurcharge will continue to\nremain higher than its method\n1 GSIB surcharge. Accordingly,\nbased on Citi\u2019s method 2\nresult as of December 31, 2022\nand its estimated method 2\nresult as of December 31,\n2023, Citi\u2019s GSIB surcharge is\nexpected to remain at 3.5%\neffective January 1, 2025.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nFramework In general, the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nregulations direct the U.S.\nbanking agencies to enforce\nincreasingly strict\nlimitations on the activities\nof insured depository\ninstitutions that fail to meet\ncertain regulatory capital\nthresholds. The PCA framework\ncontains five categories of\ncapital adequacy as measured\nby risk-based capital and\nleverage ratios: (i) \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d (ii) \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d (iii)\n\u201cundercapitalized,\u201d (iv)\n\u201csignificantly\nundercapitalized\u201d and (v)\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d\nAccordingly, an insured\ndepository institution, such\nas Citibank, must maintain\nminimum CET1 Capital, Tier 1\nCapital, Total Capital and\nLeverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%,\n10.0% and 5.0%, respectively,\nto be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized.\u201d In addition,\ninsured depository institution\nsubsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs,\nincluding Citibank, must\nmaintain a minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nof 6.0% to be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized.\u201d Citibank was\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nFurthermore, to be \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under current\nfederal bank regulatory agency\ndefinitions, a bank holding\ncompany must have a Tier 1\nCapital ratio of at least\n6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of\nat least 10.0% and not be\nsubject to a FRB directive to\nmaintain higher capital\nlevels. Stress Testing\nComponent of Capital Planning\nCiti is subject to an annual\nassessment by the FRB as to\nwhether Citigroup has\neffective capital planning\nprocesses as well as\nsufficient regulatory capital\nto absorb losses during\nstressful economic and\nfinancial conditions, while\nalso meeting obligations to\ncreditors and counterparties\nand continuing to serve as a\ncredit intermediary. This\nannual assessment includes two\nrelated programs: the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST). For the largest and\nmost complex firms, such as\nCiti, CCAR includes a\nqualitative evaluation of a\nfirm\u2019s abilities to determine\nits capital needs on a\nforward-looking basis. In\nconducting the qualitative\nassessment, the FRB evaluates\n                               33                               \nfirms\u2019 capital planning\npractices, focusing on six\nareas of capital planning:\ngovernance, risk management,\ninternal controls, capital\npolicies, incorporating\nstressful conditions and\nevents, and estimating impact\non capital positions. As part\nof the CCAR process, the FRB\nevaluates Citi\u2019s capital\nadequacy, capital adequacy\nprocess and its planned\ncapital distributions, such as\ndividend payments and common\nshare repurchases. The FRB\nassesses whether Citi has\nsufficient capital to continue\noperations throughout times of\neconomic and financial market\nstress and whether Citi has\nrobust, forward-looking\ncapital planning processes\nthat account for its unique\nrisks.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including\nCiti, are subject to a\nrigorous evaluation of their\ncapital planning process.\nFirms with weak practices may\nbe subject to a deficient\nsupervisory rating, and\npotentially an enforcement\naction, for failing to meet\nsupervisory expectations. For\nadditional information\nregarding CCAR, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nbelow.\n\nDFAST is a forward-looking\nquantitative evaluation of the\nimpact of stressful economic\nand financial market\nconditions on Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. This\nprogram serves to inform the\nFRB and the general public as\nto how Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital ratios might change\nusing a hypothetical set of\nadverse economic conditions as\ndesigned by the FRB. In\naddition to the annual\nsupervisory stress test\nconducted by the FRB, Citi is\nrequired to conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests under\nthe same adverse economic\nconditions designed by the\nFRB.\n\nBoth CCAR and DFAST include an\nestimate of projected\nrevenues, losses, reserves,\npro forma regulatory capital\nratios and any other\nadditional capital measures\ndeemed relevant by Citi.\nProjections are required over\na nine-quarter planning\nhorizon under two supervisory\nscenarios (baseline and\nseverely adverse conditions).\nAll risk-based capital ratios\nreflect application of the\nStandardized Approach\nframework under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules.\n\nIn addition, Citibank is\nrequired to conduct the annual\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Test.\nThe annual stress test\nconsists of a forward-looking\nquantitative evaluation of the\nimpact of stressful economic\nand financial market\nconditions under several\nscenarios on Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital. This\nprogram serves to inform the\nOffice of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency as to how\nCitibank\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios might change during a\nhypothetical set of adverse\neconomic conditions and to\nultimately evaluate the\nreliability of Citibank\u2019s\ncapital planning process.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank are\nrequired to disclose the\nresults of their company-run\nstress tests.\n                               34                               \n                                                                \n  Citigroup\u2019s Capital Resources                                 \n                                                                \nThe following table presents Citi\u2019s required risk-based capital\nratios as of December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022:\n                                                                \n        Ad\u2026                           S\u2026                        \n        Ap\u2026                           A\u2026                        \n        De\u2026       Se\u2026       De\u2026       D\u2026       Se\u2026       D\u2026     \n        31,       30,       31,       3\u2026       30,       3\u2026     \n        20\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026                                                            \n  C\u2026    10\u2026  %    10\u2026  %    10\u2026  %    1\u2026  %    12\u2026  %    1\u2026  %  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  1     12\u2026       12\u2026       11\u2026       1\u2026       13\u2026       1\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  C\u2026    14\u2026       14\u2026       13\u2026       1\u2026       15\u2026       1\u2026     \n  r\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \n(1) As of October 1, 2023, Citi\u2019s required regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio increased from 12.0% to 12.3% under the\nStandardized Approach, incorporating the 4.3% SCB and its\ncurrent GSIB surcharge of 3.5%.\n\n(2) Beginning January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, Citi\u2019s\nrequired risk-based capital ratios included the 4.0% SCB and\n3.5% GSIB surcharge under the Standardized Approach, and the\n2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer and 3.5% GSIB surcharge under\nthe Advanced Approaches (all of which must be composed of CET1\nCapital).

Large\nbanking organizations, such as\nCiti, would be required to\ncalculate their risk-based\ncapital ratios under both the\nnew expanded risk-based\napproach and the Standardized\nApproach and use the lower of\nthe two for each risk-based\ncapital ratio for determining\nthe binding constraints.\n\nThe expanded risk-based\napproach is designed to align\nwith the international capital\nstandards adopted by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee).\nThe Basel Committee finalized\nthe Basel III reforms in\nDecember 2017, which included\nrevisions to the methodologies\nto determine credit, market\nand operational risk-weighted\nasset amounts.\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the\ncapital proposal\u2019s impact on\nrisk-weighted asset amounts\nwould also affect several\nother requirements including\nTLAC, external long-term debt\nand the short-term wholesale\nfunding score included in the\nGSIB surcharge under method 2\n(see \u201cGSIB Surcharge\u201d below).\nThe proposal has a three-year\ntransition period that would\nbegin on July 1, 2025. If\nfinalized as proposed, the\ncapital proposal would have a\nmaterial adverse impact on\nCiti\u2019s required regulatory\ncapital.\n\nFor information about risks\nrelated to changes in\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks,\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Operational Risks\u201d and\n\u201c\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  GSIB Surcharge                                                \n                                                                \nSeparately on July 27, 2023,\nthe Federal Reserve Board\nproposed changes to the GSIB\nsurcharge rule that aim to\nmake it more risk sensitive.\nProposed changes include\nmeasuring certain systemic\nindicators on a daily versus\nquarterly average basis,\nchanging certain of the risk\nindicators and shortening the\ntime to come into compliance\nwith each year\u2019s surcharge. In\naddition, the proposal would\nnarrow surcharge bands under\nmethod 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps\nto reduce cliff effects when\nmoving between bands.\n                                                                \n  Long-Term Debt Requirements                                   \n                                                                \nOn August 29, 2023, the\nFederal Reserve Board issued a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking\nto amend the TLAC rule to\nchange the haircuts (i.e., the\npercentage reductions) that\nare applied to eligible long-\nterm debt. Under the proposed\nrule, only 50% of eligible\nlong-term debt with a maturity\nof one year or more but less\nthan two years would count\ntoward the TLAC requirement,\ninstead of the current 100%.\nThese proposed revisions are\nestimated to decrease the TLAC\npercentage of Advanced\nApproaches RWA as well as the\nTLAC percentage of Total\nLeverage Exposure. The\nproposed rule in its current\nform has no proposed\ntransition period for its\nimplementation and is not\nexpected to be material to\nCiti.\n                               46                               \nTa ngible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Return on\nEquity Tangible common equity\n(TCE), as defined by Citi,\nrepresents common\nstockholders\u2019 equity less\ngoodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nmortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs)). Return on tangible\ncommon equity (RoTCE)\nrepresents annualized net\nincome available to common\nshareholders as a percentage\nof average TCE. Tangible book\nvalue per share (TBVPS)\nrepresents average TCE divided\nby average common shares\noutstanding. Other companies\nmay calculate these measures\ndifferently. TCE, RoTCE and\nTBVPS are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.

condition. Other\nrisks and uncertainties,\nincluding those not currently\nknown to Citi or its\nmanagement, could also\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. Thus, the following\nshould not be considered a\ncomplete discussion of all of\nthe risks and uncertainties\nthat Citi may face. For\nadditional information about\nrisks and uncertainties that\ncould impact Citi, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations above and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u201d below.\nThe following risk factors are\ncategorized to improve the\nreadability and usefulness of\nthe risk factor disclosure,\nand, while the headings and\nrisk factors generally align\nwith Citi\u2019s risk\ncategorization, in certain\ninstances the risk factors may\nnot directly correspond with\nhow Citi categorizes or\nmanages its risks.\n                                                                \n  MARKET-RELATED RISKS                                          \n                                                                \nMacroeconomic, Geopolitical\nand Other Challenges and\nUncertainties Could Continue\nto Have a Negative Impact on\nCiti.\n\nCiti has experienced, and\ncould experience in the\nfuture, negative impacts to\nits businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition as a result of\nvarious macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nchallenges, uncertainties and\nvolatility. These include,\namong other things, government\nfiscal and monetary actions or\nexpected actions, including\ncontinued high interest rates,\nreductions in central bank\nbalance sheets, or other\nrestrictive interest rate or\nother monetary policies;\npotential recessions in the\nU.S., Europe and other regions\nor countries; and elevated\nlevels of inflation.\n\nFor example, in 2023, the\nU.S., the U.K., the EU and\nother economies continued to\nexperience elevated levels of\ninflation. As a result, the\nFederal Reserve Board (FRB)\nand other central banks\nsubstantially raised interest\nrates, reduced the size of\ntheir balance sheets and took\nother actions in an aggressive\neffort to curb inflation.\nThese actions may continue to\nadversely impact certain\nsectors sensitive to interest\nrates and consumer\ndiscretionary spending. They\nmay also slow economic growth,\nincrease the risk of recession\nand increase the unemployment\nrate in the U.S. and other\ncountries, all of which would\nlikely adversely affect Citi\u2019s\nconsumer and institutional\nclients, businesses and\nresults of operations. In\naddition, inflation may\ncontinue to result in higher\nlabor and other costs, thus\nputting further pressure on\nCiti\u2019s expenses. More\nrecently, the FRB has signaled\nthat it expects to reduce the\nbenchmark U.S. interest rate\nin 2024. If the FRB were to\nreduce interest rates\nprematurely, inflation could\nresurge.\n\nInterest rates on loans Citi\nmakes are typically based off\nor set at a spread over a\nbenchmark interest rate and\nwould likely decline or rise\nas benchmark rates decline or\nrise, respectively. For\nexample, while a decline in\ninterest rates would generally\nbe expected to result in lower\noverall net interest income,\nit could improve Citi\u2019s\nfunding costs. Although higher\ninterest rates would generally\nbe expected to\n\nincrease overall net interest\nincome, higher rates could\nadversely affect funding\ncosts, levels of deposits in\nits consumer and institutional\nbusinesses and certain\nbusiness or product revenues.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income could be\nadversely affected due to a\nflattening (a lower spread\nbetween shorter-term versus\nlonger-term interest rates) or\nlonger lasting or more severe\ninversion (shorter-term\ninterest rates exceeding\nlonger-term interest rates) of\nthe interest rate yield curve,\nas Citi typically pays\ninterest on deposits based on\nshorter-term interest rates\nand earns money on loans based\non longer-term interest rates.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s interest rate risk, see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Market\nRisk\u2014Banking Book Interest\nRate Risk\u201d below.\nAdditionally, Citi\u2019s balance\nsheet includes interest-rate\nsensitive fixed-rate assets\nsuch as U.S. Treasuries, U.S.\nagency securities and\nresidential mortgages, among\nothers, whose valuation would\nbe adversely impacted in a\nhigher-rate environment and/or\nwhose hedging costs may\nincrease.\n\nAdditional areas of\nuncertainty include, among\nothers, geopolitical\nchallenges, tensions and\nconflicts, including those\nrelated to Russia\u2019s war in\nUkraine (see discussion\nbelow), as well as a\npersistent and/or escalating\nconflict in the Middle East,\nparticularly if the conflict\nwere to widen to involve\nadditional combatants,\ncountries or regions; economic\nand other geopolitical\nchallenges related to China,\nincluding weak economic\ngrowth, related policy\nactions, challenges in the\nChinese real estate sector,\nbanking and credit markets,\nand tensions or conflicts\nbetween China and Taiwan\nand/or China and the U.S.;\nsignificant disruptions and\nvolatility in financial\nmarkets, including foreign\ncurrency volatility and\ndevaluations and continued\nstrength in the U.S. dollar;\nprotracted or widespread trade\ntensions; natural disasters;\nnew pandemics, including new\nCOVID-19 variants; and\npolitical polarization,\nelection outcomes and the\neffects of divided government,\nsuch as with respect to any\nextended government shutdown\nin the U.S. For example,\nCiti\u2019s market-making\nbusinesses can suffer losses\nresulting from the widening of\ncredit spreads due to\nunanticipated changes in\nfinancial markets. Moreover,\nadverse developments or\ndownturns in one or more of\nthe world\u2019s larger economies\nwould likely have a\nsignificant impact on the\nglobal economy or the\neconomies of other countries\nbecause of global financial\nand economic linkages.\n\nRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine has\ncaused supply shocks in\nenergy, food and other\ncommodities markets, worsened\ninflation, increased\ncybersecurity risks, increased\nthe risk of recession in\nEurope and heightened\ngeopolitical tensions. Actions\nby Russia, and any further\nmeasures taken by the U.S. or\nits allies, could continue to\nhave negative impacts on\nregional and global energy and\nother commodities and\nfinancial markets and\nmacroeconomic conditions,\nadversely impacting\njurisdictions where Citi\noperates and has customers,\nclients or employees. Citi\u2019s\nremaining operations in Russia\nsubject Citi to various other\nrisks, among which are foreign\ncurrency volatility, including\nappreciations or devaluations;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory Russian laws and\nregulations on the conduct of\nits remaining businesses,\nincluding, without limitation,\nits provision to its customers\nof certain securities\nservices; sanctions or asset\nfreezes; and other\ndeconsolidation events. In the\nevent of a loss of control of\nAO Citibank, Citi would be\nrequired to write off its net\ninvestment\n                               48                               \nin the entity, recognize a CTA\nloss through earnings and\nrecognize a loss on\nintercompany liabilities owed\nby AO Citibank to other Citi\nentities outside of Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss through\nearnings and would evaluate\nits remaining net investment\nas circumstances evolve.

Citi\u2019s SCB\nequals the maximum projected\ndecline in its CET1 Capital\nratio under the supervisory\nseverely adverse scenario over\na nine-quarter CCAR\nmeasurement period, plus four\nquarters of planned common\nstock dividends as a\npercentage of Citi\u2019s risk-\nweighted assets, subject to a\nminimum requirement of 2.5%.\nThe SCB is calculated by the\nFRB using its proprietary data\nand modeling of each firm\u2019s\nresults. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nSCB may change annually, based\non the supervisory stress test\nresults, thus potentially\nresulting in variability in\nthe calculation of Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio under the\nStandardized Approach. On\nOctober 1, 2023, Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio increased to\n12.3% from 12% under the\nStandardized Approach,\nreflecting the increase in the\nSCB requirement to 4.3% from\n4.0%. In addition, a breach of\nthe SCB and other regulatory\ncapital buffers may result in\ngradual limitations on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments\nto executive officers. For\nadditional information on the\nSCB, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nBuffers\u201d above.\n\nMoreover, changes in\nregulatory capital rules,\nrequirements or\ninterpretations could\nmaterially increase Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory capital.\nFor example, the U.S. banking\nregulators have proposed a\nnumber of changes to the U.S.\nregulatory capital framework,\nincluding, but not limited to,\nsignificant revisions to the\nU.S. Basel III rules, known as\nthe Basel III Endgame (capital\nproposal); changes to the\nmethod for calculating the\nGSIB surcharge; and changes to\naspects of the total loss-\nabsorbing capacity (TLAC)\nrequirements. The capital\nproposal would replace the\nAdvanced Approaches with a new\nExpanded Risk-based Approach\nfor calculating risk-\n\nweighted assets. Under the\ncapital proposal, a single\ncapital buffer, including the\nSCB, would apply to a firm\u2019s\nrisk-based capital ratios,\nregardless of whether the\napplicable ratios result from\nthe Expanded Risk-based\nApproach or the Modified\nStandardized Approach.\nAdditionally, the capital\nproposal would make various\nchanges to the calculations of\ncredit risk, market risk and\noperational risk components of\nrisk-weighted assets (see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards and\nDevelopments\u201d above). All of\nthese potential changes, if\nadopted as proposed, would\nlikely materially impact\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital\nposition and substantially\nincrease Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital requirements, and thus\nadversely impact the extent to\nwhich Citi is able to return\ncapital to shareholders.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to return\ncapital also depends on its\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition, including\nthe capital impact related to\nits remaining divestitures,\nsuch as, among other things,\nany temporary capital impact\nfrom CTA losses (net of\nhedges) between transaction\nsignings and closings (see the\ncontinued investments and the\nincorrect assumptions or\nestimates risk factors below);\nCiti\u2019s effectiveness in\nplanning, managing and\ncalculating its level of\nregulatory capital and risk-\nweighted assets under both the\nAdvanced Approaches and the\nStandardized Approach, as well\nas the Supplementary Leverage\nratio (SLR); its\nimplementation and maintenance\nof an effective capital\nplanning process and\nmanagement framework;\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions; and deferred tax\nasset (DTA) utilization (see\nthe ability to utilize DTA\nrisk factor below). The FRB\ncould also limit or prohibit\ncapital actions, such as\npaying or increasing dividends\nor repurchasing common stock\ndue to macroeconomic\ndisruptions or events, some of\nwhich occurred for a period of\ntime during the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nAll firms subject to CCAR\nrequirements, including Citi,\nwill continue to be subject to\na rigorous regulatory\nevaluation of capital planning\npractices and other reviews\nand examinations, including,\nbut not limited to data\nquality, which\n\nis a key regulatory focus,\ngovernance, risk management\nand internal controls. For\nexample, the FRB has stated\nthat it expects capital\nadequacy practices to continue\nto evolve and to likely be\ndetermined by its yearly\ncross-firm review of capital\nplan submissions. Similarly,\nthe FRB has indicated that, as\npart of its stated goal to\ncontinually evolve its annual\nstress testing requirements,\nseveral parameters of the\nannual stress testing process\nmay continue to be altered,\nincluding the number and\nseverity of the stress test\nscenarios, the FRB modeling of\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet, pre-\nprovision net revenue and\nstress losses, and the\naddition of components deemed\nimportant by the FRB.\nAdditionally, Citi\u2019s ability\nto return capital may be\nadversely impacted if a\nregulatory evaluation or\nexamination results in\nnegative findings regarding\nabsolute\n\ncapital levels or other\naspects of Citi\u2019s operations,\nincluding as a result of the\nimposition of additional\ncapital buffers, limitations\non capital distributions or\notherwise. For information on\nlimitations on Citi\u2019s ability\nto return capital to common\nshareholders, as well as the\nCCAR process, supervisory\nstress test requirements and\nGSIB surcharge, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Overview\u201d and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Stress\nTesting Component of Capital\nPlanning\u201d above and the risk\nmanagement risk factor below.\n                               49                               \nIn December 2023, the FRB\nannounced that it will\nmaintain its current framework\nfor calculating allowances on\nloans in the supervisory\nstress test through the 2024\nstress test cycle, while\ncontinuing to evaluate\nappropriate future\nenhancements to this\nframework. The impacts on\nCiti\u2019s capital adequacy of any\npotential incorporation by the\nFRB of CECL into its\nsupervisory stress tests in\nfuture stress test cycles, and\nof other potential regulatory\nchanges in the FRB\u2019s stress\ntesting methodologies, remain\nunclear. For additional\ninformation regarding the CECL\nmethodology, including the\ntransition provisions related\nto the adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Current Regulatory\nCapital Standards\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Treatment\u2014Modified\nTransition of the Current\nExpected Credit Losses\nMethodology\u201d above and Note 1.\n\nAlthough various uncertainties\nexist regarding the extent of,\nand the ultimate impact to\nCiti from, changes to\nregulatory capital, results\nfrom the FRB\u2019s stress testing\nand CCAR regimes, and\nregulatory evaluation or\nexamination findings, these\nchanges could increase the\nlevel of capital Citi is\nrequired or elects to hold,\nincluding as part of Citi\u2019s\nmanagement buffer, thus\npotentially adversely\nimpacting the extent to which\nCiti is able to return capital\nto shareholders.\n\nCiti Must Continually Review,\nAnalyze and Successfully Adapt\nto Ongoing Regulatory and\nLegislative Uncertainties and\nChanges in the U.S. and\nGlobally.\n\nCiti, its management and its\nbusinesses continue to face\nregulatory and legislative\nuncertainties and changes,\nboth in the U.S. and globally.\nWhile the ongoing regulatory\nand legislative uncertainties\nand changes facing Citi are\ntoo numerous to list\ncompletely, examples include,\nbut are not limited to (i)\npotential changes to various\naspects of the U.S. regulatory\ncapital framework and\nrequirements applicable to\nCiti, including, among others,\nsignificant revisions to the\nU.S. Basel III rules, known as\nthe Basel III Endgame (for\ninformation about the Basel\nIII Endgame, see the capital\nreturn risk factor and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards\nDevelopments\u201d above); (ii)\npotential fiscal, monetary,\ntax, sanctions and other\nchanges promulgated by the\nU.S. federal government and\nother governments, including\npotential changes in\nregulatory requirements\nrelating to interest rate risk\nmanagement; and (iii) rapidly\nevolving legislative and\nregulatory requirements and\nother government initiatives\nin the EU, the U.S. and\nglobally related to climate\nchange and other ESG areas\nthat vary, and may conflict,\nacross jurisdictions,\nincluding any new disclosure\nrequirements (see the climate\nchange and heightened\nregulatory scrutiny and\nongoing interpretation of\nregulatory changes risk\nfactors below). References to\n\u201cregulatory\u201d refer to both\nformal regulation and the\nviews and expectations of\nCiti\u2019s regulators in their\nsupervisory roles, which, as\nthey\n\nchange over time, can have a\nmajor impact. In particular,\nthe\n\nU.S. regulators have indicated\nthat the level of their\n\nexpectations is increasing and\nprompt negative examination\n\nfindings/ratings and\nenforcements actions are more\nlikely.\n\nFor example, in February 2023,\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (CFPB)\nproposed significant changes\nto the maximum amounts on\ncredit card late fees, which,\nif adopted\n\nas proposed, would reduce\ncredit card fee revenues in\nBranded Cards and Retail\nServices in USPB . In\naddition, U.S. and\ninternational regulatory and\nlegislative initiatives have\nnot always been undertaken or\nimplemented on a coordinated\nbasis, and areas of divergence\nhave developed and continue to\ndevelop with respect to their\nscope, interpretation, timing,\nstructure or approach, leading\nto inconsistent or even\nconflicting requirements,\nincluding within a single\njurisdiction.\n\nFurther, ongoing regulatory\nand legislative uncertainties\nand changes make Citi\u2019s long-\nterm business, balance sheet\nand strategic budget planning\ndifficult, subject to change\nand potentially more costly\nand may impact its results of\noperations. U.S. and other\nregulators globally have\nimplemented and continue to\ndiscuss various changes to\ncertain regulatory\nrequirements, which would\nrequire ongoing assessment by\nmanagement as to the impact to\nCiti, its businesses and\nbusiness planning. Business\nplanning must necessarily be\nbased on possible or proposed\nrules or outcomes, which can\nchange significantly upon\nfinalization, or upon\nimplementation or interpretive\nguidance from numerous\nregulatory bodies worldwide,\nand such guidance can change.\nRegulatory and legislative\nchanges have also\nsignificantly increased Citi\u2019s\ncompliance risks and costs\n(see the implementation and\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges risk factor below) and\ncan adversely affect Citi\u2019s\ncompetitive position, as well\nas its businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition.\n\nCiti\u2019s Ability to Achieve Its\nObjectives from Its\nTransformation,\nOrganizational, Simplification\nand Other Strategic and Other\nInitiatives May Not Be as\nSuccessful as It Projects or\nExpects.\n\nAs part of its transformation\ninitiatives, Citi continues to\nmake significant investments\nto improve its risk and\ncontrols environment,\nmodernize its data and\ntechnology infrastructure and\nfurther enhance safety and\nsoundness (see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above and the legal\nand regulatory proceedings\nrisk factor below). Citi also\ncontinues to make business-led\ninvestments, as part of the\nexecution of its strategic\ninitiatives. For example, Citi\nhas been making investments\nacross the Company, including\nhiring front office colleagues\nin key strategic markets and\nbusinesses; enhancing product\ncapabilities and platforms to\ngrow key businesses, improve\nclient digital experiences and\nadd scalability; and\nimplementing new capabilities\nand partnerships. These\nbusiness-led investments are\ndesigned to grow revenues as\nwell as result in retention\nand efficiency improvements.\n\nAdditionally, Citi has been\npursuing overall\nsimplification initiatives\nthat include management and\noperating model changes and\nactions to enhance focus on\nclients and reduce expenses.\nCiti\u2019s simplification actions\nalso include divestiture of\nthe Mexico Consumer/SBMM\noperations and completing\nother exits and wind-downs in\norder to streamline Citi and\nassist in optimizing its\nallocation of resources. These\noverall simplification\ninitiatives involve various\nexecution challenges and may\nresult in higher than expected\nexpenses, litigation and\nregulatory scrutiny, CTA and\nother losses or other negative\nfinancial or strategic\nimpacts, which could be\nmaterial (for information\nabout potential CTA impacts,\nsee the capital\n                               50                               \nreturn risk factor above and\nthe incorrect assumptions or\nestimates risk factor below).\n\nCiti\u2019s multiyear\ntransformation, as well as its\nsimplification initiatives,\ninvolve significant\ncomplexities and\nuncertainties. In addition,\nthere is inherent risk that\nCiti\u2019s transformation and\nsimplification initiatives\nwill not be as productive or\neffective as Citi expects, or\nat all. Conversely, failure to\nadequately invest in and\nupgrade Citi\u2019s technology and\nprocesses or properly\nimplement its enterprise-wide\nsimplification could result in\nCiti\u2019s inability to meet\nregulatory expectations, be\nsufficiently competitive,\nserve clients effectively and\navoid disruptions to its\nbusinesses and operational\nerrors (see the operational\nprocesses and systems and\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factors\nbelow). Citi\u2019s ability to\nachieve expected returns and\noperational improvements\ndepends, in part, on factors\nthat it cannot control,\nincluding, among others,\nmacroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties; customer,\nclient and competitor actions;\nand ongoing regulatory\nrequirements or changes.\n\nCiti\u2019s transformation,\nstrategic and other\ninitiatives may continue to\nevolve as its business\nstrategies, the market\nenvironment and regulatory\nexpectations change, which\ncould make the initiatives\nmore costly and more\nchallenging to implement, and\nlimit their effectiveness.\n\nClimate Change Presents\nVarious Financial and Non-\nFinancial Risks to Citi and\nIts Customers and Clients.\n\nClimate change presents both\nimmediate and long-term risks\nto Citi and its customers and\nclients, with the risks\nexpected to increase over\ntime. Climate risks can arise\nfrom both physical risks\n(those risks related to the\nphysical effects of climate\nchange) and transition risks\n(risks related to regulatory,\nmarket, technological,\nstakeholder and legal changes\nfrom a transition to a low-\ncarbon economy). Physical and\ntransition risks can manifest\nthemselves differently across\nCiti\u2019s risk categories in the\nshort, medium and long terms.\n\nPhysical risks from climate\nchange include acute risks,\nsuch as hurricanes, floods and\ndroughts, as well as\nconsequences of chronic\nchanges in climate, such as\nrising sea levels, prolonged\ndroughts and systemic changes\nto geographies and any\nresulting population\nmigration. For example,\nphysical risks could have\nadverse financial, operational\nand other impacts on Citi,\nboth directly on its business\nand operations, and indirectly\nas a result of impacts to\nCiti\u2019s clients, customers,\nvendors and other\ncounterparties. These impacts\ncan include destruction,\ndamage or impairment of owned\nor leased properties and other\nassets, destruction or\ndeterioration of the value of\ncollateral, such as real\nestate, disruptions to\nbusiness operations and supply\nchains and reduced\navailability or increase in\nthe cost of insurance.\nPhysical risks can also impact\nCiti\u2019s credit risk exposures,\nfor example, in its mortgage\nand commercial real estate\nlending businesses.\n\nTransition risks may arise\nfrom changes in regulations or\nmarket preferences toward low-\ncarbon industries or sectors,\nwhich in turn could have\nnegative impacts on asset\nvalues, results of operations\nor the reputations of Citi and\nits customers and clients. For\nexample, Citi\u2019s corporate\ncredit exposures include oil\nand gas, power and other\nindustries that may experience\nreduced demand for carbon-\nintensive products\n\ndue to the transition to a\nlow-carbon economy. Failure to\nadequately consider transition\nrisk in developing and\nexecuting on its business\nstrategy could lead to a loss\nof market share, lower\nrevenues and higher credit\ncosts. Transition risks also\ninclude potential increased\noperational, compliance and\nenergy costs driven by\ngovernment policies to promote\ndecarbonization.\n\nMoreover, increasing\nlegislative and regulatory\nchanges and uncertainties\nregarding climate-related risk\nmanagement and disclosures are\nlikely to result in increased\nregulatory, compliance,\ncredit, reputational and other\nrisks and costs for Citi. New\nregulations have been enacted\nand/or are expected in several\njurisdictions, including the\nEU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability\nReporting Directive (CSRD),\nthe SEC climate-related\ndisclosures that could require\ndisclosure of climate-related\ninformation and the State of\nCalifornia\u2019s legislation\nenacted in October 2023\nrequiring broad disclosure of\ngreenhouse gas emissions and\nother climate-related\ninformation largely beginning\nin 2026. In addition, Citi\ncould face increased\nregulatory scrutiny and\nreputation and litigation\nrisks as a result of its\nclimate risk, sustainability\nand other ESG-related\ncommitments and disclosures.\n\nEven as some regulators seek\nto mandate additional\ndisclosure of climate-related\ninformation, Citi\u2019s ability to\ncomply with such requirements\nand conduct more robust\nclimate-related risk analyses\nmay be hampered by lack of\ninformation and reliable data.\nData on climate-related risks\nis limited in availability,\noften based on estimated or\nunverified figures, collected\nand reported on a time-lag,\nand variable in quality.\nModeling capabilities to\nanalyze climate-related risks\nand interconnections are\nimproving, but remain\nincomplete. U.S. and non-U.S.\nbanking regulators and others\nare increasingly focusing on\nthe issue of climate risk at\nfinancial institutions, both\ndirectly and with respect to\ntheir clients. For example, in\nOctober 2023, the FRB, FDIC\nand OCC jointly released\nprinciples that provide a\nhigh-level framework for the\nsafe and sound management of\nexposures to climate-related\nfinancial risks, including\nphysical and transition risks,\nfor financial institutions\nwith more than $100 billion in\nassets.\n\nAdditionally, if Citi\u2019s\nresponse to climate change is\nperceived to be ineffective or\ninsufficient or Citi is unable\nto achieve its objectives or\ncommitments relating to\nclimate change, its\nbusinesses, reputation,\nattractiveness to certain\ninvestors and efforts to\nrecruit and retain employees\nmay suffer. For example,\nCiti's approach to supporting\nclient decarbonization in a\ngradual and orderly way, while\npromoting energy security, may\nlead to both continued\nexposure to carbon-intensive\nactivity and increased\nreputation risks from\nstakeholders with divergent\npoints of view. Citi also\nfaces anti-ESG challenges from\ncertain U.S. state and other\ngovernments that may impact\nits ability to conduct certain\nbusiness within those\njurisdictions.\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nclimate and other\nsustainability initiatives,\nsee \u201cClimate Change and Net\nZero\u201d below. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\nmanagement of climate risk,\nsee \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Strategic Risk\u2014Climate\nRisk\u201d below.\n                               51                               \nCiti\u2019s Ability to Utilize Its\nDTAs, and Thus Reduce the\nNegative Impact of the DTAs on\nCiti\u2019s Regulatory Capital,\nWill Be Driven by Its Ability\nto Generate U.S. Taxable\nIncome.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Citi\u2019s\nnet DTAs were $29.6 billion,\nnet of a valuation allowance\nof $3.6 billion, of which\n$12.8 billion was deducted\nfrom Citi\u2019s CET1 Capital under\nthe U.S. Basel III rules. Of\nthis deducted amount, $12.1\nbillion related to net\noperating losses, foreign tax\ncredit and general business\ncredit carry-forwards, with\n$2.3 billion related to\ntemporary differences in\nexcess of the 10%/15%\nregulatory limitations,\nreduced by $1.6 billion of\ndeferred tax liabilities,\nprimarily associated with\ngoodwill and certain other\nintangible assets that were\nseparately deducted from\ncapital.\n\nCiti\u2019s overall ability to\nrealize its DTAs will\nprimarily be dependent upon\nCiti\u2019s ability to generate\nU.S. taxable income in the\nrelevant reversal periods.\nFailure to realize any portion\nof the net DTAs would have a\ncorresponding negative impact\non Citi\u2019s net income and\nfinancial returns.\n\nThe accounting treatment for\nrealization of DTAs is complex\nand requires significant\njudgment and estimates\nregarding future taxable\nearnings in the jurisdictions\nin which the DTAs arise and\navailable tax planning\nstrategies. Forecasts of\nfuture taxable earnings will\ndepend upon various factors,\nincluding, among others,\nmacroeconomic conditions. In\naddition, any future increase\nin U.S. corporate tax rates\ncould result in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s DTAs, which may subject\nmore of Citi\u2019s DTAs to\nexclusion from regulatory\ncapital.\n\nCiti has not been and does not\nexpect to be subject to the\nbase erosion anti-abuse tax\n(BEAT), which, if applicable\nto Citi in any given year,\nwould have a significantly\nadverse effect on both Citi\u2019s\nnet income and regulatory\ncapital.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s DTAs, including FTCs,\nsee \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d below\nand Notes 1 and 10.\n\nCiti\u2019s Interpretation or\nApplication of the Complex Tax\nLaws to Which It Is Subject\nCould Differ from Those of\nGovernmental Authorities,\nWhich Could Result in\nLitigation or Examinations and\nthe Payment of Additional\nTaxes, Penalties or Interest.\n\nCiti is subject to various\nincome-based tax laws of the\nU.S. and its states and\nmunicipalities, as well as the\nnumerous non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which it\noperates. These tax laws are\ninherently complex, and Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these laws to\nits entities, operations and\nbusinesses.\n\nFor example, the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) Pillar 2\ninitiative contemplates a 15%\nglobal minimum tax with\nrespect to earnings in each\ncountry. EU member states were\nrequired to adopt the OECD\nPillar 2 rules in 2023, with\nan effective date of January\n1, 2024 (unless an exception\napplied), and other non-U.S.\ncountries have similarly\nadopted or are expected to\nadopt the rules. Under these\nrules, Citi will be required\nto pay a \u201ctop-up\u201d tax to the\nextent that Citi\u2019s effective\ntax rate in any given country\nis below 15%. Beginning in\n2024, countries that adopted\nthe OECD Pillar 2 rules in\n2023 can collect the top-up\ntax only with respect to\nearnings of entities in their\njurisdiction or subsidiaries\nof such entities. Beginning in\n2025, all countries\n\nthat have adopted the OECD\nPillar 2 rules can collect a\nshare of the top-up tax owed\nwith respect to any member of\nthe Pillar 2 multinational\ngroup. While Citi does not\ncurrently expect the rules to\nhave a material impact on its\nearnings, many aspects of the\napplication of the rules\nremain uncertain.\n\nAdditionally, Citi is subject\nto litigation or examinations\nwith U.S. and non-U.S. tax\nauthorities regarding non-\nincome-based tax matters.\nWhile Citi has appropriately\nreserved for such matters\nwhere there is a probable\nloss, and has disclosed\nreasonably possible losses,\nthe outcome of the matters may\nbe different than Citi\u2019s\nexpectations. Citi\u2019s\ninterpretations or application\nof the tax laws, including\nwith respect to withholding,\nstamp, service and other non-\nincome taxes, could differ\nfrom that of the relevant\ngovernmental taxing authority,\nwhich could result in the\nrequirement to pay additional\ntaxes, penalties or interest,\nthe reduction of certain tax\nbenefits or the requirement to\nmake adjustments to amounts\nrecorded, which could be\nmaterial. See Note 30 for\nadditional information on\nlitigation and examinations\ninvolving non-U.S. tax\nauthorities.\n\nA Deterioration in or Failure\nto Maintain Citi\u2019s Co-Branding\nor Private Label Credit Card\nRelationships Could Have a\nNegative Impact on Citi.\n\nCiti has co-branding and\nprivate label relationships\nthrough its Branded Cards and\nRetail Services credit card\nbusinesses with various\nretailers and merchants,\nwhereby in the ordinary course\nof business Citi issues credit\ncards to consumers, including\ncustomers of the retailers or\nmerchants. The five largest\nrelationships across both\nbusinesses in USPB constituted\nan aggregate of approximately\n11% of Citi\u2019s revenues in 2023\n(see \u201c U.S. Personal Banking \u201d\nabove). Citi\u2019s co-branding and\nprivate label agreements often\nprovide for shared economics\nbetween the parties and\ngenerally have a fixed term.\n\nCompetition among card\nissuers, including Citi, for\nthese relationships is\nsignificant, and Citi may not\nbe able to maintain such\nrelationships on existing\nterms or at all. Citi\u2019s co-\nbranding and private label\nrelationships could also be\nnegatively impacted by, among\nother things, the general\neconomic environment,\nincluding the impacts of\ncontinued elevated interest\nrates and inflation, and lower\neconomic growth rates, as well\nas a continuing risk of\nrecession; changes in consumer\nsentiment, spending patterns\nand credit card usage\nbehaviors; a decline in sales\nand revenues, partner store\nclosures, any reduction in air\nand business travel, or other\noperational difficulties of\nthe retailer or merchant;\nearly termination due to a\ncontractual breach or exercise\nof other early termination\nright; or other factors,\nincluding bankruptcies,\nliquidations, restructurings,\nconsolidations or other\nsimilar events, whether due to\na challenging macroeconomic\nenvironment or otherwise.\n\nThese events, particularly\nearly termination and\nbankruptcies or liquidations,\ncould negatively impact the\nresults of operations or\nfinancial condition of Branded\nCards, Retail Services or Citi\nas a whole, including as a\nresult of loss of revenues,\nincreased expenses, higher\ncost of credit, impairment of\npurchased credit card\nrelationships and contract-\nrelated intangibles or other\nlosses (see Note 17 for\ninformation on Citi\u2019s credit\ncard related intangibles\ngenerally).\n                               52                               \nThe Application of U.S.\nResolution Plan Requirements\nMay Pose a Greater Risk of\nLoss to Citi\u2019s Debt and Equity\nSecurities Holders, and Citi\u2019s\nInability in Its Resolution\nPlan Submissions to Address\nAny Shortcomings or\nDeficiencies or Guidance Could\nSubject Citi to More Stringent\nCapital, Leverage or Liquidity\nRequirements, or Restrictions\non Its Growth, Activities or\nOperations, and Could\nEventually Require Citi to\nDivest Assets or Operations.\n\nTitle I of the Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires Citi to prepare and\nsubmit a plan to the FRB and\nthe FDIC for the orderly\nresolution of Citigroup (the\nbank holding company) and its\nsignificant legal entities\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\nin the event of future\nmaterial financial distress or\nfailure.\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s preferred \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d resolution\nplan strategy, only Citigroup,\nthe parent holding company,\nwould enter into bankruptcy,\nwhile Citigroup\u2019s material\nlegal entities (as defined in\nthe public section of its 2023\nresolution plan, which can be\nfound on the FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s\nwebsites) would remain\noperational outside of any\nresolution or insolvency\nproceedings. As a result,\nCitigroup\u2019s losses and any\nlosses incurred by its\nmaterial legal entity\nsubsidiaries would be imposed\nfirst on holders of\nCitigroup\u2019s equity securities\nand thereafter on its\nunsecured creditors, including\nholders of eligible long-term\ndebt and other debt\nsecurities.\n\nIn addition, a wholly owned,\ndirect subsidiary of Citigroup\nserves as a resolution funding\nvehicle (the IHC) to which\nCitigroup has transferred, and\nhas agreed to transfer on an\nongoing basis, certain assets.\nThe obligations of Citigroup\nand of the IHC, respectively,\nunder the amended and restated\nsecured support agreement, are\nsecured on a senior basis by\nthe assets of Citigroup (other\nthan shares in subsidiaries of\nthe parent company and certain\nother assets), and the assets\nof the IHC, as applicable. As\na result, claims of the\noperating material legal\nentities against the assets of\nCitigroup with respect to such\nsecured assets are effectively\nsenior to unsecured\nobligations of Citigroup.\nCiti\u2019s single point of entry\nresolution plan strategy and\nthe obligations under the\namended and restated secured\nsupport agreement may result\nin the recapitalization of\nand/or provision of liquidity\nto Citi\u2019s operating material\nlegal entities, and the\ncommencement of bankruptcy\nproceedings by Citigroup at an\nearlier stage of financial\nstress than might otherwise\noccur without such mechanisms\nin place.\n\nIn line with the FRB\u2019s TLAC\nrule, Citigroup\u2019s shareholders\nand unsecured\ncreditors\u2014including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders\u2014would bear any losses\nresulting from Citigroup\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Accordingly, any\nvalue realized by holders of\nits unsecured long-term debt\nmay not be sufficient to repay\nthe amounts owed to such debt\nholders in the event of a\nbankruptcy or other resolution\nproceeding of Citigroup. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s single point of entry\nresolution plan strategy and\nthe IHC and secured support\nagreement, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nOn November 22, 2022, the FRB\nand FDIC issued feedback on\nthe resolution plans filed on\nJuly 1, 2021 by the eight U.S.\nGSIBs, including Citi. The FRB\nand FDIC identified one\nshortcoming, but no\ndeficiencies, in Citi\u2019s 2021\nresolution plan. The\nshortcoming related to data\nintegrity and data quality\nmanagement issues,\nspecifically, weaknesses in\n\nCiti\u2019s processes and practices\nfor producing certain data\nthat could materially impact\nits resolution capabilities.\nIf a shortcoming is not\nsatisfactorily explained or\naddressed before, or in, the\nsubmission of the next\nresolution plan, the\nshortcoming may be found to be\na deficiency in the next\nresolution plan (see\ndiscussion below). Citi\nsubmitted its 2023 resolution\nplan in June 2023. More\ngenerally, data continues\n\nto be a subject of regulatory\nfocus, and Citi continues to\nwork\n\non enhancing its data\navailability and quality.\n\nUnder Title I, if the FRB and\nthe FDIC jointly determine\nthat Citi\u2019s resolution plan is\nnot \u201ccredible\u201d (which,\nalthough not defined, is\ngenerally understood to mean\nthe regulators do not believe\nthe plan is feasible or would\notherwise allow Citi to be\nresolved in a way that\nprotects systemically\nimportant functions without\nsevere systemic disruption),\nor would not facilitate an\norderly resolution of Citi\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, and Citi fails to\nresubmit a resolution plan\nthat remedies any identified\ndeficiencies, Citi could be\nsubjected to more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements, or restrictions\non its growth, activities or\noperations. If within two\nyears from the imposition of\nany such requirements or\nrestrictions Citi has still\nnot remediated any identified\ndeficiencies, then Citi could\neventually be required to\ndivest certain assets or\noperations. Any such\nrestrictions or actions would\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nreputation, market and\ninvestor perception,\noperations and strategy.\n\nCiti\u2019s Performance and Its\nAbility to Effectively Execute\nIts Transformation and\nStrategic and Other\nInitiatives Could Be\nNegatively Impacted if It Is\nNot Able to Hire and Retain\nQualified Employees.\n\nCiti\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of its individual\nbusinesses largely depend on\nthe talents and efforts of its\ndiverse and highly qualified\ncolleagues. Specifically,\nCiti\u2019s continued ability to\ncompete in each of its lines\nof business, to manage its\nbusinesses effectively and to\nexecute its transformation and\nstrategic and other\ninitiatives, including, for\nexample, hiring front office\ncolleagues to grow businesses\nor hiring colleagues to\nsupport Citi\u2019s transformation\nand strategic and other\ninitiatives, depends on its\nability to attract new\ncolleagues and to retain and\nmotivate its existing\ncolleagues. If Citi is unable\nto continue to attract, retain\nand motivate highly qualified\ncolleagues, Citi\u2019s\nperformance, including its\ncompetitive position, the\nexecution of its\ntransformation and strategic\nand other initiatives and its\nresults of operations could be\nnegatively impacted.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to attract,\nretain and motivate colleagues\ndepends on numerous factors,\nsome of which are outside of\nCiti\u2019s control. For example,\nthe competition for talent\ncontinues to be particularly\nintense due to factors such as\nlow unemployment and changes\nin worker expectations,\nconcerns and preferences,\nincluding an increased demand\nfor remote work options and\nother job flexibility. Also,\nthe banking industry generally\nis subject to more\ncomprehensive regulation of\nemployee compensation than\nother industries, including\ndeferral and clawback\nrequirements for incentive\ncompensation, which can make\nit unusually challenging for\nCiti to compete in labor\nmarkets against businesses,\nincluding, for example,\ntechnology companies, that are\nnot subject to\n                               53                               \nsuch regulation. In addition,\nin 2023 Citi announced plans\nto reduce management layers\nfrom 13 to a median of eight\nas part of organizational\nsimplification initiatives\nthat also involve significant\nreductions in functional\nroles, which could also impact\nits ability to attract and\nretain colleagues. Other\nfactors that could impact its\nability to attract, retain and\nmotivate colleagues include,\namong other things, Citi\u2019s\npresence in a particular\nmarket or region, the\nprofessional and development\nopportunities, its reputation\nand its diversity. For\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\ncolleagues and workforce\nmanagement, see \u201cHuman Capital\nResources and Management\u201d\nbelow.\n\nCiti Faces Increased\nCompetitive Challenges,\nIncluding from Financial\nServices and Other Companies\nand Emerging Technologies.\n\nCiti operates in an\nincreasingly evolving and\ncompetitive business\nenvironment, which includes\nboth financial and non-\nfinancial services firms, such\nas traditional banks, online\nbanks, private credit and\nfinancial technology companies\nand others. These companies\ncompete on the basis of, among\nother factors, size, reach,\nquality and type of products\nand services offered, price,\ntechnology and reputation.\nCertain competitors may be\nsubject to different and, in\nsome cases, less stringent\nlegal and regulatory\nrequirements, whether due to\nsize, jurisdiction, entity\ntype or other factors, placing\nCiti at a competitive\ndisadvantage.\n\nFor example, Citi competes\nwith other financial services\ncompanies in the U.S. and\nglobally that have grown\nrapidly over the last several\nyears or have developed and\nintroduced new products and\nservices. Potential mergers\nand acquisitions involving\ntraditional financial services\ncompanies such as regional\nbanks or credit card issuers,\nas well as networks and\nmerchant acquirers, may also\nincrease competition and\nimpact Citi\u2019s ability to offer\ncompetitive pricing and\nrewards. Non-traditional\nfinancial services firms, such\nas private credit and\nfinancial technology\ncompanies, are less regulated\nand continue to expand their\nofferings of services\ntraditionally provided by\nfinancial institutions. The\ngrowth of certain of these\ncompetitors has increased\nmarket and counterparty credit\nrisks, particularly in a more\nchallenging macroeconomic\nenvironment (see the risk\nfactor on credit and\nconcentrations of risk below).\nIn addition, emerging\ntechnologies have the\npotential to intensify\ncompetition and accelerate\ndisruption in the financial\nservices industry. For\nexample, despite difficulties\nand turmoil faced by the\ndigital asset market in recent\nyears, clients and investors\nhave exhibited a sustained\ninterest in digital assets.\nFinancial services firms and\nother market participants have\nbegun to offer services\nrelated to those assets. Citi\nmay not be able to provide the\nsame or similar services for\nlegal or regulatory reasons,\nwhich may be exacerbated by\nrapidly evolving and\nconflicting regulatory\nrequirements, and due to\nincreased compliance and other\nrisks. Further, changes in the\npayments space (e.g., instant\nand 24x7 payments) are\naccelerating, and, as a\nresult, certain of Citi\u2019s\nproducts and services could\nbecome less competitive.\n\nIncreased competition and\nemerging technologies have\nrequired and could require\nCiti to change or adapt its\nproducts and services, as well\nas invest in and develop\nrelated infrastructure, to\nattract and retain customers\nor clients or to compete more\neffectively with competitors,\nincluding new\n\nmarket entrants.\nSimultaneously, as Citi\ndevelops new products and\nservices leveraging emerging\ntechnologies, new risks may\nemerge that, if not designed\nand governed adequately, may\nresult in control gaps and in\nCiti operating outside of its\nrisk appetite. For example,\nfailure to strategically\nembrace the potential of\nartificial intelligence (AI)\nmay result in a competitive\ndisadvantage to Citi. At the\nsame time, as a new\ntechnology, use of AI without\nsufficient controls,\ngovernance and risk management\nmay result in increased risks\nacross all of Citi\u2019s risk\ncategories. As another\nexample, instant and 24x7\npayments products could be\naccompanied by challenges to\nforecasting and managing\nliquidity, as well as\nincreased operational and\ncompliance risks.\n\nMoreover, Citi relies on third\nparties to support certain of\nits product and service\nofferings, which may put Citi\nat a disadvantage to\ncompetitors who may directly\noffer a broader array of\nproducts and services. Also,\nCiti\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and reputation may\nsuffer if any third party is\nunable to provide adequate\nsupport for such product and\nservice offerings, whether due\nto operational incidents or\notherwise (see the operational\nprocesses and systems,\ncybersecurity and emerging\nmarkets risk factors below).\n\nTo the extent that Citi is not\nable to compete effectively\nwith financial services\ncompanies, including private\ncredit and financial\ntechnology companies, and non-\nfinancial services firms, Citi\ncould be placed at a\ncompetitive disadvantage,\nwhich could result in loss of\ncustomers and market share,\nand its businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition could suffer. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s competitors, see the\nco-brand and private label\ncards and qualified colleagues\nrisk factors above and\n\u201cSupervision, Regulation and\nOther\u2014Competition\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISKS                                             \n                                                                \nA Failure or Disruption of\nCiti\u2019s Operational Processes\nor Systems Could Negatively\nImpact Its Reputation,\nCustomers, Clients, Businesses\nor Results of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\n\nCiti\u2019s global operations rely\nheavily on its technology\nsystems and infrastructure,\nincluding the accurate, timely\nand secure processing,\nmanagement, storage and\ntransmission of data,\nincluding confidential\ntransactions, and other\ninformation, as well as the\nmonitoring of a substantial\namount of data and complex\ntransactions in real time.\nCiti obtains and stores an\nextensive amount of personal\nand client-specific\ninformation for its consumer\nand institutional customers\nand clients, and must\naccurately record and reflect\ntheir account transactions.\nCiti\u2019s operations must also\ncomply with complex and\nevolving laws, regulations and\nheightened regulatory\nexpectations in the countries\nin which it operates (see the\nimplementation and\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges and legal proceedings\nrisk factors below). With the\nevolving proliferation of new\ntechnologies and the\nincreasing use of the\ninternet, mobile devices and\ncloud services to conduct\nfinancial transactions and\ncustomers\u2019 and clients\u2019\nincreasing use of online\nbanking and trading systems\nand other platforms, large\nglobal financial institutions\nsuch as Citi have been, and\nwill continue to be, subject\nto an ever-increasing risk of\noperational loss, failure or\ndisruption.\n                               54                               \nAlthough Citi has continued to\nupgrade its technology,\nincluding systems to automate\nprocesses and gain\nefficiencies, operational\nincidents are unpredictable\nand can arise from numerous\nsources, not all of which are\nfully within Citi\u2019s control.\nThese include, among others,\noperational or execution\nfailures, or deficiencies by\nthird parties, including third\nparties that provide products\nor services to Citi (e.g.,\ncloud service providers),\nother market participants or\nthose that otherwise have an\nongoing partnership or\nbusiness relationship with\nCiti; deficiencies in\nprocesses or controls;\ninadequate management of data\ngovernance practices, data\ncontrols and monitoring\nmechanisms that may adversely\nimpact internal or external\nreporting and decision-making;\ncyber or information security\nincidents (see the\ncybersecurity risk factor\nbelow); human error, such as\nmanual transaction processing\nerrors (e.g., erroneous\npayments to lenders or manual\nerrors by traders that cause\nsystem and market disruptions\nor losses), which can be\nexacerbated by staffing\nchallenges and processing\nbacklogs; fraud or malice on\nthe part of employees or third\nparties; insufficient (or\nlimited) straight-through\nprocessing between legacy or\nbespoke systems and any\nfailure to design and\neffectively operate controls\nthat mitigate operational\nrisks associated with those\nlegacy or bespoke systems,\nleading to potential risk of\nerrors and operating losses;\naccidental system or\ntechnological failure;\nelectrical or\ntelecommunication outages;\nfailures of or cyber incidents\ninvolving computer servers or\ninfrastructure, including\ncloud services; or other\nsimilar losses or damage to\nCiti\u2019s property or assets (see\nalso the climate change risk\nfactor above).\n\nFor example, operational\nincidents can arise as a\nresult of failures by third\nparties with which Citi does\nbusiness, such as failures by\ninternet, mobile technology\nand cloud service providers or\nother vendors to adequately\nfollow procedures or\nprocesses, safeguard their\nsystems or prevent system\ndisruptions or cyberattacks.\nFailure by Citi to develop,\nimplement and operate a third-\nparty risk management program\ncommensurate with the level of\nrisk, complexity and nature of\nits third-party relationships\ncan also result in operational\nincidents. In addition, Citi\nhas experienced and could\nexperience further losses\nassociated with manual\ntransaction processing errors,\nincluding erroneous payments\nto lenders or manual errors by\nCiti traders that cause system\nand market disruptions and\nlosses for Citi and its\nclients. Irrespective of the\nsophistication of the\ntechnology utilized by Citi,\nthere will always be some room\nfor human and other errors. In\nview of the large transactions\nin which Citi engages, such\nerrors could result in\nsignificant losses. While Citi\nhas change management\nprocesses in place to\nappropriately upgrade its\noperational processes and\nsystems to ensure that any\nchanges introduced do not\nadversely impact security and\noperational continuity, such\nchange management can fail or\nbe ineffective. Furthermore,\nwhen Citi introduces new\nproducts, systems or\nprocesses, new operational\nrisks that may arise from\nthose changes may not be\nidentified, or adequate\ncontrols to mitigate the\nidentified risks may not be\nappropriately implemented or\noperate as designed.\n\nIncidents that impact\ninformation security,\ntechnology operations or other\noperational processes may\ncause disruptions and/or\nmalfunctions within Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses (e.g., the\ntemporary loss of availability\nof Citi\u2019s online banking\n\nsystem or mobile banking\nplatform), as well as the\noperations of its clients,\ncustomers or other third\nparties. In addition,\noperational incidents could\ninvolve the failure or\nineffectiveness of internal\nprocesses or controls. Given\nCiti\u2019s global footprint and\nthe high volume of\ntransactions processed by\nCiti, certain failures, errors\nor actions may be repeated or\ncompounded before they are\ndiscovered and rectified,\nwhich would further increase\nthe consequences and costs.\nOperational incidents could\nresult in financial losses and\nother costs as well as\nmisappropriation, corruption\nor loss of confidential and\nother information or assets,\nwhich could significantly\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nreputation, customers,\nclients, businesses or results\nof operations and financial\ncondition. Cyber-related and\nother operational incidents\ncan also result in legal and\nregulatory actions or\nproceedings, fines and other\ncosts (see the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below).\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nmanagement of operational\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s and Third Parties\u2019\nComputer Systems and Networks\nWill Continue to Be\nSusceptible to an Increasing\nRisk of Continually Evolving,\nSophisticated Cybersecurity\nIncidents That Could Result in\nthe Theft, Loss, Non-\nAvailability, Misuse or\nDisclosure of Confidential\nClient or Customer\nInformation, Damage to Citi\u2019s\nReputation, Additional Costs\nto Citi, Regulatory Penalties,\nLegal Exposure and Financial\nLosses.\n\nCiti\u2019s computer systems,\nsoftware and networks are\nsubject to ongoing attempted\ncyberattacks, such as\nunauthorized access, loss or\ndestruction of data (including\nconfidential client\ninformation), account\ntakeovers, disruptions of\nservice, phishing, malware,\nransomware, computer viruses\nor other malicious code and\nother similar events. These\nthreats can arise from\nexternal parties, including\ncyber criminals, cyber\nterrorists, hacktivists\n(individuals or groups using\ncyberattacks to promote a\npolitical or social agenda)\nand nation-state actors, as\nwell as insiders who knowingly\nor unknowingly engage in or\nenable malicious cyber\nactivities. Citi develops its\nown software and relies on\nthird-party applications and\nsoftware, which are\nsusceptible to vulnerability\nexploitations. Software\nleveraged in financial\nservices and other industries\ncontinues to be impacted by an\nincreasing number of zero-day\nvulnerabilities, thus\nincreasing inherent cyber risk\nto Citi.\n\nThe increasing use of mobile\nand other digital banking\nplatforms and services, cloud\ntechnologies and connectivity\nsolutions to facilitate remote\nworking for Citi\u2019s employees\nall increase Citi\u2019s exposure\nto cybersecurity risks. Citi\nis also susceptible to\ncyberattacks given, among\nother things, its size and\nscale, high-profile brand,\nglobal footprint and prominent\nrole in the financial system,\nas well as the ongoing wind-\ndown of its businesses in\nRussia (see the macroeconomic\nand geopolitical risk factor\nabove and \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d below).\nAdditionally, Citi continues\nto operate in multiple\njurisdictions in the midst of\ngeopolitical unrest, including\nactive conflicts in Ukraine\nand the Middle East, which\ncould expose Citi to\nheightened risk of insider\nthreat, politically motivated\nhacktivism or other cyber\nthreats.\n                               55                               \nCiti continues to experience\nincreased exposure to\ncyberattacks through third\nparties, in part because\nfinancial institutions are\nbecoming increasingly\ninterconnected with central\nagents, exchanges and clearing\nhouses. Third parties with\nwhich Citi does business, as\nwell as retailers and other\nthird parties with which\nCiti\u2019s customers do business,\nand any such third parties\u2019\ndownstream service providers,\nalso pose cybersecurity risks,\nparticularly where activities\nof customers are beyond Citi\u2019s\nsecurity and control systems.\nFor example, Citi outsources\ncertain functions, such as\nprocessing customer credit\ncard transactions, uploading\ncontent on customer-facing\nwebsites and developing\nsoftware for new products and\nservices. These relationships\nallow for the storage and\nprocessing of customer\ninformation by third-party\nhosting of, or access to, Citi\nwebsites. This could lead to\ncompromise or the potential to\nintroduce vulnerable or\nmalicious code, resulting in\nsecurity breaches or business\ndisruptions impacting Citi\ncustomers, employees or\noperations. While many of\nCiti\u2019s agreements with third\nparties include\nindemnification provisions,\nCiti may not be able to\nrecover sufficiently, or at\nall, under these provisions to\nadequately offset any losses\nand other adverse impacts Citi\nmay incur from third-party\ncyber incidents.\n\nCiti and some of its third-\nparty partners have been\nsubjected to attempted and\nsometimes successful\ncyberattacks over the last\nseveral years, including (i)\ndenial of service attacks,\nwhich attempt to interrupt\nservice to clients and\ncustomers; (ii) hacking and\nmalicious software\ninstallations intended to gain\nunauthorized access to\ninformation systems or to\ndisrupt those systems and/or\nimpact availability or privacy\nof confidential data, with\nobjectives including, but not\nlimited to, extortion payments\nor causing reputational\ndamage; (iii) data breaches\ndue to unauthorized access to\ncustomer account or other\ndata; and (iv) malicious\nsoftware attacks on client\nsystems, in attempts to gain\nunauthorized access to Citi\nsystems or client data under\nthe guise of normal client\ntransactions.\n\nWhile Citi\u2019s monitoring and\nprotection services have\nhistorically generally\nsucceeded in detecting,\nthwarting and/or responding to\nattacks targeting its systems\nbefore they become\nsignificant, certain past\nincidents resulted in limited\nlosses, as well as increases\nin expenditures to monitor\nagainst the threat of similar\nfuture cyber incidents. There\ncan be no assurance that such\ncyber incidents will not occur\nagain, and they could occur\nmore frequently, via novel\ntactics, including leveraging\nof tools made possible by\nemerging technologies, and on\na more significant scale.\nDespite the significant\nresources Citi allocates to\nimplement, maintain, monitor\nand regularly upgrade its\nsystems and networks with\nmeasures such as intrusion\ndetection and prevention\nsystems and firewalls to\nsafeguard critical business\napplications, there is no\nguarantee that these measures\nor any other measures can\nprovide sufficient security.\nBecause the techniques used to\ninitiate cyberattacks change\nfrequently or, in some cases,\nare not recognized until\nlaunched or even later, Citi\nmay be unable to implement\neffective preventive measures\nor otherwise proactively\naddress these methods. In\naddition, cyber threats and\ncyberattack techniques change,\ndevelop and evolve rapidly,\nincluding from emerging\ntechnologies such as\nartificial intelligence, cloud\ncomputing and quantum\n\ncomputing. Given the frequency\nand sophistication of\ncyberattacks, the\ndetermination of the severity\nand potential impact of a\ncyber incident may not become\napparent for a substantial\nperiod of time following\ndetection of the incident.\nAlso, while Citi strives to\nimplement measures to reduce\nthe exposure resulting from\noutsourcing risks, such as\nperforming security control\nassessments of third-party\nvendors and limiting third-\nparty access to the least\nprivileged level necessary to\nperform job functions, these\nmeasures cannot prevent all\nthird-party related\ncyberattacks or data breaches.\nIn addition, the risk of\ninsider threat may be elevated\nin the near term due to Citi\u2019s\noverall simplification\ninitiatives, including\nstreamlining its global staff\nfunctions.\n\nCyber incidents can result in\nthe disclosure of personal,\nconfidential or proprietary\ncustomer, client or employee\ninformation; damage to Citi\u2019s\nreputation with its clients,\nother counterparties and the\nmarket; customer\ndissatisfaction; and\nadditional costs to Citi,\nincluding expenses such as\nrepairing or replacing\nsystems, replacing customer\npayment cards, credit\nmonitoring or adding new\npersonnel or protection\ntechnologies. Cyber incidents\ncan also result in regulatory\npenalties, loss of revenues,\ndeposit flight, exposure to\nlitigation and other financial\nlosses, including loss of\nfunds to both Citi and its\nclients and customers, and\ndisruption to Citi\u2019s\noperational systems (see the\noperational processes and\nsystems risk factor above).\nMoreover, the increasing risk\nof cyber incidents has\nresulted in increased\nlegislative and regulatory\naction on cybersecurity,\nincluding, among other things,\nscrutiny of firms\u2019\ncybersecurity protection\nservices, laws and regulations\nto enhance protection of\nconsumers\u2019 personal data and\nmandated disclosure on\ncybersecurity matters. For\nexample, in July 2023, the SEC\nfinalized new rules requiring\ntimely disclosure of material\ncybersecurity incidents as\nwell as other annual cyber-\nrelated disclosures (see\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational\nRisk\u2014Cybersecurity Risk\u201d\nbelow).\n\nWhile Citi maintains insurance\ncoverage that may, subject to\npolicy terms and conditions\nincluding significant self-\ninsured deductibles, cover\ncertain aspects of cyber\nrisks, such insurance coverage\nmay be insufficient to cover\nall losses and may not take\ninto account reputational\nharm, the costs of which are\nimpossible to quantify.\n\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s management of\ncybersecurity risk, see\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational\nRisk\u2014Cybersecurity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nChanges or Errors in\nAccounting Assumptions,\nJudgments or Estimates, or the\nApplication of Certain\nAccounting Principles, Could\nResult in Significant Losses\nor Other Adverse Impacts.\n\nU.S. GAAP requires Citi to use\ncertain assumptions, judgments\nand estimates in preparing its\nfinancial statements,\nincluding, among other items,\nthe estimate of the ACL;\nreserves related to\nlitigation, regulatory and tax\nmatters; valuation of DTAs;\nthe fair values of certain\nassets and liabilities; and\nthe assessment of goodwill and\nother assets for impairment.\nThese assumptions, judgments\nand estimates are inherently\nlimited because they involve\ntechniques, including the use\nof historical data in many\ncircumstances, that cannot\nanticipate every economic and\nfinancial outcome in the\nmarkets in which Citi\noperates, nor can they\nanticipate the\n                               56                               \nspecifics and timing of such\noutcomes. For example, many\nmodels used by Citi include\nassumptions about correlation\nor lack thereof among prices\nof various asset classes or\nother market indicators that\nmay not hold in times of\nmarket stress, limited\nliquidity or other unforeseen\ncircumstances.\n\nIf Citi\u2019s assumptions,\njudgments or estimates\nunderlying its financial\nstatements are incorrect or\ndiffer from actual or\nsubsequent events, Citi could\nexperience unexpected losses\nor other adverse impacts, some\nof which could be significant.\nCiti could also experience\ndeclines in its stock price,\nbe subject to legal and\nregulatory proceedings and\nincur fines and other losses.\nFor additional information on\nthe key areas for which\nassumptions and estimates are\nused in preparing Citi\u2019s\nfinancial statements, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below and Notes 1\nand 16. For example, the CECL\nmethodology requires that Citi\nprovide reserves for a current\nestimate of lifetime expected\ncredit losses for its loan\nportfolios and other financial\nassets, as applicable, at the\ntime those assets are\noriginated or acquired. This\nestimate is adjusted each\nperiod for changes in expected\nlifetime credit losses. Citi\u2019s\nACL estimate depends upon its\nCECL models and assumptions;\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions, including, among\nother things, the U.S.\nunemployment rate and U.S.\ninflation-adjusted gross\ndomestic product (real GDP);\nand the credit indicators,\ncomposition and other\ncharacteristics of Citi\u2019s loan\nportfolios and other\napplicable financial assets.\nThese model assumptions and\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions will change over\ntime, resulting in variability\nin Citi\u2019s ACL and, thus,\nimpact its results of\noperations and financial\ncondition, as well as\nregulatory capital due to the\nCECL phase-in (see the capital\nreturn risk factor above).\n\nMoreover, Citi has incurred\nlosses related to its foreign\noperations that are reported\nin the CTA components of\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) . In accordance with\nU.S. GAAP, a sale, substantial\nliquidation or other\ndeconsolidation event of any\nforeign operations, such as\nthose related to Citi\u2019s\nremaining divestitures or\nlegacy businesses, would\nresult in reclassification of\nany foreign CTA component of\nAOCI related to that foreign\noperation, including related\nhedges and taxes, into Citi\u2019s\nearnings. For example, Citi\ncould incur a significant loss\non sale due to CTA losses\nrelated to any signing of a\nsale agreement for its\nremaining consumer banking\ndivestitures (see the capital\nreturn and continued\ninvestments risk factors\nabove). The majority of these\nlosses would be regulatory\ncapital neutral at closing.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s accounting policy for\nforeign currency translation\nand its foreign CTA components\nof AOCI , see Notes 1 and 21.\n\nChanges to Financial\nAccounting and Reporting\nStandards or Interpretations\nCould Have a Material Impact\non How Citi Records and\nReports Its Financial\nCondition and Results of\nOperations.\n\nPeriodically, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board\n(FASB) issues financial\naccounting and reporting\nstandards that govern key\naspects of Citi\u2019s financial\nstatements or interpretations\nthereof when those standards\nbecome effective, including\nthose areas where Citi is\nrequired to make assumptions\nor estimates. Changes to\nfinancial accounting or\n\nreporting standards or\ninterpretations, whether\npromulgated or required by the\nFASB, the SEC, U.S. banking\nregulators or others, could\npresent operational challenges\nand could also require Citi to\nchange certain of the\nassumptions or estimates it\npreviously used in preparing\nits financial statements,\nwhich could negatively impact\nhow it records and reports its\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations\ngenerally and/or with respect\nto particular businesses. See\nNote 1 for additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\naccounting policies and\nchanges in accounting,\nincluding the expected impacts\non Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition.\n\nIf Citi\u2019s Risk Management and\nOther Processes, Strategies or\nModels Are Deficient or\nIneffective, Citi May Incur\nSignificant Losses and Its\nRegulatory Capital and Capital\nRatios Could Be Negatively\nImpacted.\n\nCiti utilizes a broad and\ndiversified set of risk\nmanagement and other processes\nand strategies, including the\nuse of models in analyzing and\nmonitoring the various risks\nCiti assumes in conducting its\nactivities. For example, Citi\nuses models as part of its\ncomprehensive stress testing\ninitiatives across the\nCompany. Citi also relies on\ndata to aggregate, assess and\nmanage various risk exposures.\nManagement of these risks and\nthe reliability of the data\nare made more challenging\nwithin a large, global\nfinancial institution, such as\nCiti, particularly due to\ncomplex, diverse and rapidly\nchanging financial markets and\nconditions in which Citi\noperates. Unexpected losses\ncan result from untimely,\ninaccurate or incomplete\nprocesses and data. As\ndiscussed below, in October\n2020, Citigroup and Citibank\nentered into consent orders\nwith the FRB and OCC that\nrequire Citigroup and Citibank\nto make improvements in\nvarious aspects of enterprise-\nwide risk management,\ncompliance, data quality\nmanagement and governance, and\ninternal controls (see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d\nabove and the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below).\n\nCiti\u2019s risk management and\nother processes, strategies\nand models are inherently\nlimited because they involve\ntechniques, including the use\nof historical data in many\ncircumstances, assumptions and\njudgments that cannot\nanticipate every economic and\nfinancial outcome in the\nmarkets in which Citi\noperates, particularly given\nvarious macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nchallenges and uncertainties\n(see the macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties\nrisk factor above), nor can\nthey anticipate the specifics\nand timing of such outcomes.\nFor example, many models used\nby Citi include assumptions\nabout correlation or lack\nthereof among prices of\nvarious asset classes or other\nmarket indicators that may not\nnecessarily hold in times of\nmarket stress, limited\nliquidity or other unforeseen\ncircumstances, or identify\nchanges in markets or client\nbehaviors not yet inherent in\nhistorical data. Citi could\nincur significant losses,\nreceive\n\nnegative regulatory evaluation\nor examination findings or be\n\nsubject to additional\nenforcement actions, and its\nregulatory capital, capital\nratios and ability to return\ncapital could be negatively\nimpacted, if Citi\u2019s risk\nmanagement and other\nprocesses, including its\nability to manage and\naggregate data in a timely and\naccurate manner, strategies or\nmodels are deficient or\nineffective. For additional\ninformation, see the capital\nreturn risk factor above and\nthe heightened regulatory\n                               57                               \nscrutiny and ongoing\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges risk factor below.\nSuch deficiencies or\nineffectiveness could also\nresult in inaccurate\nfinancial, regulatory or risk\nreporting.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s Basel III\nregulatory capital models,\nincluding its credit, market\nand operational risk models,\ncurrently remain subject to\nongoing regulatory review and\napproval, which may result in\nrefinements, modifications or\nenhancements (required or\notherwise) to these models.\nCiti is required to notify and\nobtain preapproval from both\nthe OCC and FRB prior to\nimplementing certain risk-\nweighted asset treatments, as\nwell as certain model changes,\nresulting in a more\nchallenging environment within\nwhich Citi must operate in\nmanaging its risk-weighted\nassets. Modifications or\nrequirements resulting from\nthese ongoing reviews, as well\nas any future changes or\nguidance provided by the U.S.\nbanking regulators regarding\nthe U.S. regulatory capital\nframework applicable to Citi,\nincluding, but not limited to,\npotential revisions to the\nU.S. Basel III rules, known as\nthe Basel III Endgame (for\ninformation about the Basel\nIII Endgame, see the capital\nreturn risk factor and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards\nDevelopments\u201d above), have\nresulted in, and could\ncontinue to result in,\nsignificant changes to Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets. These\nchanges can negatively impact\nCiti\u2019s capital ratios and its\nability to meet its regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n                                                                \n  CREDIT RISKS                                                  \n                                                                \nCredit Risk and Concentrations\nof Risk Can Increase the\nPotential for Citi to Incur\nSignificant Losses.\n\nCiti has credit exposures to\nconsumer, corporate and public\nsector borrowers and other\ncounterparties in the U.S. and\nvarious countries and\njurisdictions globally,\nincluding end-of-period\nconsumer loans of $389 billion\nand end-of-period corporate\nloans of $300 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s corporate and consumer\nloan portfolios, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Corporate Credit\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d below.\n\nA default by or a significant\ndowngrade in the credit\nratings of a borrower or other\ncounterparty, or a decline in\nthe credit quality or value of\nany underlying collateral,\nexposes Citi to credit risk.\nDespite Citi\u2019s target client\nstrategy, various\nmacroeconomic, geopolitical,\nmarket and other factors,\namong other things, can\nincrease Citi\u2019s credit risk\nand credit costs, particularly\nfor vulnerable sectors,\nindustries or countries (see\nthe macroeconomic challenges\nand uncertainties and co-\nbranding and private label\ncredit card risk factors above\nand the emerging markets risk\nfactor below). For example, a\nweakening of economic\nconditions can adversely\naffect borrowers\u2019 ability to\nrepay their obligations, as\nwell as result in Citi being\nunable to liquidate the\ncollateral it holds or forced\nto liquidate the collateral at\nprices that do not cover the\nfull amount owed to Citi. Citi\nis also a member of various\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties and could incur\nfinancial losses as a result\nof defaults by other clearing\nmembers due to the\nrequirements of clearing\nmembers to share losses.\nAdditionally, due to the\ninterconnectedness among\nfinancial institutions,\nconcerns about the\ncreditworthiness of or\ndefaults by a financial\ninstitution could spread to\nother financial market\nparticipants and result in\nmarket-wide losses and\ndisruption.\n\nFor example, the failure of\nregional banks and other\nbanking stresses in the first\nhalf of 2023 resulted in\nmarket volatility across the\nfinancial sector.\n\nWhile Citi provides reserves\nfor expected losses for its\ncredit exposures, as\napplicable, such reserves are\nsubject to judgments and\nestimates that could be\nincorrect or differ from\nactual future events. Under\nthe CECL accounting standard,\nthe ACL reflects expected\nlosses, which has resulted in\nand could lead to additional\nvolatility in the allowance\nand the provision for credit\nlosses (including provisions\nfor loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments, and ACL builds\nfor Other assets ) as\nforecasts of economic\nconditions change. For\nadditional information, see\nthe incorrect assumptions or\nestimates and changes to\nfinancial accounting and\nreporting standards risk\nfactors above. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below and Notes 1\nand 16. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s credit\nand country risk, see also\neach respective business\u2019s\nresults of operations above,\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u201d and \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country Risk\u201d\nbelow and Notes 15 and 16.\n\nConcentrations of risk to\nclients or counterparties\nengaged in the same or related\nindustries or doing business\nin a particular geography, or\nto a particular product or\nasset class, especially credit\nand market risks, can also\nincrease Citi\u2019s risk of\nsignificant losses. For\nexample, Citi routinely\nexecutes a high volume of\nsecurities, trading,\nderivative and foreign\nexchange transactions with\nnon-U.S. sovereigns and with\ncounterparties in the\nfinancial services industry,\nincluding banks, insurance\ncompanies, investment banks,\ngovernments, central banks and\nother financial institutions.\nMoreover, Citi has\nindemnification obligations in\nconnection with various\ntransactions that expose it to\nconcentrations of risk,\nincluding credit risk from\nhedging or reinsurance\narrangements related to those\nobligations (see Note 28). A\nrapid deterioration of a large\nborrower or other counterparty\nor within a sector or country\nin which Citi has large\nexposures or indemnifications\nor unexpected market\ndislocations could lead to\nconcerns about the\ncreditworthiness of other\nborrowers or counterparties in\na certain geography and in\nrelated or dependent\nindustries, and such\nconditions could cause Citi to\nincur significant losses.\n                                                                \n  LIQUIDITY RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Businesses, Results of\nOperations and Financial\nCondition Could Be Negatively\nImpacted if It Does Not\nEffectively Manage Its\nLiquidity.\n\nAs a large, global financial\ninstitution, adequate\nliquidity and sources of\nfunding are essential to\nCiti\u2019s businesses. Citi\u2019s\nliquidity, sources of funding\nand costs of funding can be\nsignificantly and negatively\nimpacted by factors it cannot\ncontrol, such as general\ndisruptions in the financial\nmarkets (e.g., the failure of\nregional banks and other\nbanking stresses in the first\nhalf of 2023); changes in\nfiscal and monetary policies\nand regulatory requirements;\nnegative investor perceptions\nof Citi\u2019s creditworthiness;\ndeposit outflows or\nunfavorable changes in deposit\nmix; unexpected increases in\ncash or collateral\nrequirements; credit ratings;\nand the consequent inability\nto monetize available\nliquidity resources.\n                               58                               \nIn addition, Citi competes\nwith other banks and financial\ninstitutions for both\ninstitutional and consumer\ndeposits, which represent\nCiti\u2019s most stable and lowest\ncost source of long-term\nfunding. The competition for\ndeposits has continued to\nincrease, including as a\nresult of quantitative\ntightening by central banks,\nthe current higher interest\nrate environment and fixed\nincome alternatives for\ncustomer funds.\n\nFurther, Citi\u2019s costs to\nobtain and access wholesale\nfunding are directly related\nto changes in interest and\ncurrency exchange rates and\nits credit spreads. Changes in\nCiti\u2019s credit spreads are\ndriven by both external market\nfactors and factors specific\nto Citi, such as negative\nviews by investors of the\nfinancial services industry or\nCiti\u2019s financial prospects,\nand can be highly volatile.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s primary sources of\nfunding, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to obtain\nfunding may be impaired and\nits cost of funding could also\nincrease if other market\nparticipants are seeking to\naccess the markets at the same\ntime or to a greater extent\nthan expected, or if market\nappetite for corporate debt\nsecurities declines, as is\nlikely to occur in a liquidity\nstress event or other market\ncrisis. Citi\u2019s ability to sell\nassets may also be impaired if\nother market participants are\nseeking to sell similar assets\nat the same time or a liquid\nmarket does not exist for such\nassets. Additionally,\nunexpected changes in client\nneeds due to idiosyncratic\nevents or market conditions\ncould result in greater than\nexpected drawdowns from off-\nbalance sheet committed\nfacilities. A sudden drop in\nmarket liquidity could also\ncause a temporary or\nprotracted dislocation of\ncapital markets activity. In\naddition, clearing\norganizations, central banks,\nclients and financial\ninstitutions with which Citi\ninteracts may exercise the\nright to require additional\ncollateral during challenging\nmarket conditions, which could\nfurther impair Citi\u2019s\nliquidity. If Citi fails to\neffectively manage its\nliquidity, its businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition could be\nnegatively impacted.\n\nLimitations on the payments\nthat Citigroup Inc. receives\nfrom its subsidiaries could\nalso impact its liquidity. As\na holding company, Citigroup\nInc. relies on interest,\ndividends, distributions and\nother payments from its\nsubsidiaries to fund dividends\nas well as to satisfy its debt\nand other obligations. Several\nof Citi\u2019s U.S. and non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries are or may be\nsubject to capital adequacy or\nother liquidity, regulatory or\ncontractual restrictions on\ntheir ability to provide such\npayments, including any local\nregulatory stress test\nrequirements and inter-\naffiliate arrangements entered\ninto in connection with\nCitigroup Inc.\u2019s resolution\nplan. Citigroup Inc.\u2019s broker-\ndealer and bank subsidiaries\nare subject to restrictions on\ntheir ability to lend or\ntransact with affiliates, as\nwell as restrictions on their\nability to use funds deposited\nwith them in brokerage or bank\naccounts to fund their\nbusinesses.\n\nA bank holding company is also\nrequired by law to act as a\nsource of financial and\nmanagerial strength for its\nsubsidiary banks. As a result,\nthe FRB may require Citigroup\nInc. to commit resources to\nits subsidiary banks even if\ndoing so is not otherwise in\nthe interests of Citigroup\nInc. or its shareholders or\ncreditors, reducing the amount\nof funds available to meet its\nobligations.\n\nA Ratings Downgrade Could\nAdversely Impact Citi\u2019s\nFunding and Liquidity.\n\nThe credit rating agencies,\nsuch as Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service and S&P\nGlobal Ratings, continuously\nevaluate Citi and certain of\nits subsidiaries. Their\nratings of Citi and its rated\nsubsidiaries\u2019 long-term debt\nand short-term obligations are\nbased on firm-specific\nfactors, including the\nfinancial strength of Citi and\nsuch subsidiaries, as well as\nfactors that are not entirely\nwithin the control of Citi and\nits subsidiaries, such as the\nagencies\u2019 proprietary rating\nmethodologies and assumptions,\npotential impact from negative\nactions on U.S. sovereign\nratings and conditions\naffecting the financial\nservices industry and markets\ngenerally.\n\nCiti and its subsidiaries may\nnot be able to maintain their\ncurrent respective ratings and\noutlooks. Rating downgrades\ncould negatively impact Citi\nand its rated subsidiaries\u2019\nability to access the capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds as well as increase\ncredit spreads and the costs\nof those funds. A ratings\ndowngrade could also have a\nnegative impact on Citi and\nits rated subsidiaries\u2019\nability to obtain funding and\nliquidity due to reduced\nfunding capacity and the\nimpact from derivative\ntriggers, which could require\nCiti and its rated\nsubsidiaries to meet cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements or permit\ncounterparties to terminate\ncertain contracts. In\naddition, a ratings downgrade\ncould have a negative impact\non other funding sources such\nas secured financing and other\nmargined transactions for\nwhich there may be no explicit\ntriggers.\n\nFurthermore, a credit ratings\ndowngrade could have impacts\nthat may not be currently\nknown to Citi or are not\npossible to quantify. Some of\nCiti\u2019s counterparties and\nclients could have ratings\nlimitations on their\npermissible counterparties, of\nwhich Citi may or may not be\naware. Certain of Citi\u2019s\ncorporate customers and\ntrading counterparties, among\nother clients, could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit the trading of certain\nmarket instruments, and limit\nor withdraw deposits placed\nwith Citi in response to\nratings downgrades. Changes in\ncustomer and counterparty\nbehavior could impact not only\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nbut also the results of\noperations of certain Citi\nbusinesses. For additional\ninformation on the potential\nimpact of a reduction in\nCiti\u2019s or Citibank\u2019s credit\nratings, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISKS                                              \n                                                                \nSignificantly Heightened\nRegulatory Expectations and\nScrutiny in the U.S. and\nGlobally and Ongoing\nInterpretation and\nImplementation of Regulatory\nand Legislative Requirements\nand Changes Have Increased\nCiti\u2019s Compliance, Regulatory\nand Other Risks and Costs.\n\nLarge financial institutions,\nsuch as Citi, face\nsignificantly heightened\nregulatory expectations and\nscrutiny in the U.S. and\nglobally, including with\nrespect to, among other\nthings, governance,\ninfrastructure, data and risk\nmanagement practices and\ncontrols. These regulatory\nexpectations extend to their\nemployees and agents and also\ninclude, among other things,\nthose related to customer and\nclient protection, market\npractices, anti-money\nlaundering, increasingly\ncomplex sanctions and\ndisclosure regimes and various\nregulatory\n                               59                               \nreporting requirements. U.S.\nfinancial institutions also\nface increased expectations\nand scrutiny in the wake of\nthe failures of several\nregional banks and other\nbanking stresses in the first\nhalf of 2023. In addition,\nCiti is continually required\nto interpret and implement\nextensive and frequently\nchanging regulatory and\nlegislative requirements in\nthe U.S. and other\njurisdictions in which it does\nbusiness, which may overlap or\nconflict across jurisdictions,\nresulting in substantial\ncompliance, regulatory and\nother risks and costs.\n\nA failure to comply with these\nexpectations and requirements,\neven if inadvertent, or\nresolve any identified\ndeficiencies in a timely and\nsufficiently satisfactory\nmanner to regulators, could\nresult in increased regulatory\noversight; material\nrestrictions, including, among\nothers, imposition of\n\nadditional capital buffers and\nlimitations on capital\n\ndistributions; enforcement\nproceedings; penalties; and\nfines (see the capital return\nrisk factor above and legal\nand regulatory proceedings\nrisk factor below).\n\nOver the past several years,\nCiti has been required to\nimplement a large number of\nregulatory and legislative\nchanges, including new\nregulatory or legislative\nrequirements or regimes,\nacross its businesses and\nfunctions, and these changes\ncontinue. The changes\nthemselves may be complex and\nsubject to interpretation, and\nresult in changes to Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses. In addition, the\nchanges require continued\nsubstantial technology and\nother investments. In some\ncases, Citi\u2019s implementation\nof a regulatory or legislative\nrequirement is occurring\nsimultaneously with changing\nor conflicting regulatory\nguidance from multiple\njurisdictions\n\n(including various U.S.\nstates) and regulators, legal\nchallenges or legislative\naction to modify or repeal\nexisting rules or enact new\nrules.\n\nExamples of regulatory or\nlegislative changes that have\nresulted in increased\ncompliance risks and costs\ninclude (i) the U.S.\nregulatory capital framework\nand requirements, which have\ncontinued to evolve (see the\ncapital return risk factor and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d above);\n(ii) various laws relating to\nthe limitation of cross-border\ndata movement and/or\ncollection and use of customer\ninformation, including data\nlocalization and protection\nand privacy laws, which also\ncan conflict with or increase\ncompliance complexity with\nrespect to other laws,\nincluding anti-money\nlaundering laws; and (iii) the\nEU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability\nReporting Directive, which may\noverlap but also diverge from\nclimate-related disclosure\nrequirements expected to come\ninto effect in other\njurisdictions, including in\nthe U.S. In addition, certain\nU.S. regulatory agencies and\nstates and non-U.S.\nauthorities have prioritized\nissues of social, economic and\nracial justice, and are in the\nprocess of considering ways in\nwhich these issues can be\nmitigated, including through\nrulemaking, supervision and\nother means, even while\ncertain U.S. state and other\ngovernments are pursuing and\nsignaling challenges that may\nconflict with corporate ESG\ninitiatives.\n\nCiti Is Subject to Extensive\nLegal and Regulatory\nProceedings, Examinations,\nInvestigations, Consent Orders\nand Related Compliance Efforts\nand Other Inquiries That Could\nResult in Large Monetary\nPenalties, Supervisory or\nEnforcement Orders, Business\nRestrictions, Limitations on\n\nDividends, Changes to\nDirectors and/or Officers and\nCollateral Consequences\nArising from Such Outcomes.\n\nAt any given time, Citi is a\nparty to a significant number\nof legal and regulatory\nproceedings and is subject to\nnumerous governmental and\nregulatory examinations.\nAdditionally, Citi remains\nsubject to governmental and\nregulatory investigations,\nconsent orders (see discussion\nbelow) and related compliance\nefforts, and other inquiries.\nCiti could also be subject to\nenforcement proceedings and\nnegative regulatory evaluation\n\nor examination findings not\nonly because of violations of\nlaws and regulations, but also\ndue to failures, as determined\nby its regulators, to have\nadequate policies and\nprocedures, or to remedy\ndeficiencies on a timely basis\n(see also the capital return\nand resolution plan risk\nfactors above). Citi\u2019s\nregulators have broad powers\nand discretion under their\nprudential and supervisory\nauthority, and have pursued\nactive inspection and\ninvestigatory oversight.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nOctober 2020 FRB and OCC\nconsent orders require\nCitigroup and Citibank to\nimplement extensive targeted\naction plans and submit\nquarterly progress reports on\na timely and sufficient basis\ndetailing the results and\nstatus of improvements\nrelating principally to\nvarious aspects of enterprise-\nwide risk management,\ncompliance, data quality\nmanagement and governance, and\ninternal controls. These\nimprovements will result in\ncontinued significant\ninvestments by Citi during\n2024 and beyond, as an\nessential part of Citi\u2019s\nbroader transformation efforts\nto enhance its risk, controls,\ndata and finance\ninfrastructure and compliance.\nThere can be no assurance that\nsuch improvements will be\nimplemented in a manner\nsatisfactory, in both timing\nand sufficiency, to the FRB\nand OCC.\n\nAlthough there are no\nrestrictions on Citi\u2019s ability\nto serve its clients, the OCC\nconsent order requires\nCitibank to obtain prior\napproval of any significant\nnew acquisition, including any\nportfolio or business\nacquisition, excluding\nordinary course transactions.\nMoreover, the OCC consent\norder provides that the OCC\nhas the right to assess future\ncivil money penalties or take\nother supervisory and/or\nenforcement actions. Such\nactions by the OCC could\ninclude imposing business\nrestrictions, including\npossible limitations on the\ndeclaration or payment of\ndividends and changes in\ndirectors and/or senior\nexecutive officers. More\ngenerally, the OCC and/or the\nFRB could take additional\nenforcement or other actions\nif the regulatory agency\nbelieves that Citi has not met\nregulatory expectations\nregarding compliance with the\nconsent orders. For additional\ninformation regarding the\nconsent orders, see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d\nabove.\n\nThe global judicial,\nregulatory and political\nenvironment has generally been\nchallenging for large\nfinancial institutions, which\nhave been subject to increased\nregulatory scrutiny. The\ncomplexity of the federal and\nstate regulatory and\nenforcement regimes in the\nU.S., coupled with the global\nscope of Citi\u2019s operations,\nalso means that a single event\nor issue may give rise to a\nlarge number of overlapping\ninvestigations and regulatory\nproceedings, either by\nmultiple federal and state\nagencies and authorities in\nthe U.S. or by multiple\nregulators and other\ngovernmental entities in\nforeign jurisdictions, as well\nas multiple civil litigation\nclaims in multiple\njurisdictions. Violations of\nlaw by other financial\ninstitutions may also result\nin regulatory scrutiny of\nCiti. Responding to regulatory\n                               60                               \ninquiries and proceedings can\nbe time consuming and costly,\nand divert management\nattention from Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses.\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators\nhave been increasingly focused\non the culture of financial\nservices firms, including\nCiti, as well as \u201cconduct\nrisk,\u201d a term used to describe\nthe risks associated with\nbehavior by employees and\nagents, including third\nparties, that could harm\nclients, customers, employees\nor the integrity of the\nmarkets, such as improperly\ncreating, selling, marketing\nor managing products and\nservices or improper incentive\ncompensation programs with\nrespect thereto, failures to\nsafeguard a party\u2019s personal\ninformation, or failures to\nidentify and manage conflicts\nof interest.\n\nIn addition to the greater\nfocus on conduct risk, the\ngeneral heightened scrutiny\nand expectations from\nregulators could lead to\ninvestigations and other\ninquiries, as well as\nremediation requirements,\nregulatory restrictions,\nstructural changes, more\nregulatory or other\nenforcement proceedings, civil\nlitigation and higher\ncompliance and other risks and\ncosts. For additional\ninformation, see the capital\nreturn and\n\nheightened regulatory scrutiny\nand ongoing interpretation of\n\nregulatory changes risk\nfactors above. Further, while\nCiti takes numerous steps to\nprevent and detect conduct by\nemployees and agents that\ncould potentially harm\nclients, customers, employees\nor the integrity of the\nmarkets, such behavior may not\nalways be deterred or\nprevented.\n\nMoreover, the severity of the\nremedies sought in legal and\nregulatory proceedings to\nwhich Citi is subject has\nremained elevated. For\nexample, U.S. and certain\nnon-U.S. governmental entities\nhave increasingly brought\ncriminal actions against, or\nhave sought and obtained\ncriminal guilty pleas or\ndeferred prosecution\nagreements from, financial\ninstitutions and individual\nemployees. These types of\nactions by U.S. and other\ngovernments may, in the\nfuture, have significant\ncollateral consequences for\nCiti, including loss of\ncustomers and business,\noperational loss, and the\ninability to offer certain\nproducts or services and/or\noperate certain businesses.\nCiti may be required to accept\nor be subject to similar types\nof criminal remedies, consent\norders, sanctions, substantial\nfines and penalties,\nremediation and other\nfinancial costs or other\nrequirements in the future,\nincluding for matters or\npractices not yet known to\nCiti, any of which could\nmaterially and negatively\naffect Citi\u2019s businesses,\nbusiness practices, financial\ncondition or results of\noperations, require material\nchanges in Citi\u2019s operations\nor cause Citi substantial\nreputational harm.\n\nAdditionally, many large\nclaims\u2014both private civil and\nregulatory\u2014asserted against\nCiti are highly complex, slow\nto develop and may involve\nnovel or untested legal\ntheories. The outcome of such\nproceedings is difficult to\npredict or estimate until late\nin the proceedings. Although\nCiti establishes accruals for\nits legal and regulatory\nmatters according to\naccounting requirements,\nCiti\u2019s estimates of, and\nchanges to, these accruals\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty, and\nthe amount of loss ultimately\nincurred in relation to those\nmatters may be substantially\nhigher than the amounts\naccrued (see the incorrect\nassumptions or estimates risk\nfactor above). In addition,\ncertain settlements are\nsubject to court approval and\nmay not be approved.

Citi\u2019s presence in\nthe emerging markets subjects\nit to various risks.\n\nEmerging market risks include,\namong others, limitations or\nunavailability of hedges on\nforeign investments; foreign\ncurrency volatility, including\ndevaluations and strength in\nthe U.S. dollar; sustained\nelevated interest rates and\nquantitative tightening;\nelevated inflation and\nhyperinflation; foreign\nexchange controls, including\nan inability to access\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms; macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and domestic\npolitical challenges,\nuncertainties and volatility,\nincluding with respect to\nRussia (see the macroeconomic\nand geopolitical risk factor\nabove and \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d and \u201c\u2014Ukraine\u201d\nbelow); cyberattacks;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory laws and\nregulations; sanctions or\nasset freezes; sovereign debt\nvolatility; fluctuations in\ncommodity prices; election\noutcomes; regulatory changes,\nincluding potential conflicts\namong regulations with other\njurisdictions where Citi does\nbusiness; limitations on\nforeign investment;\nsociopolitical instability;\ncivil unrest; crime,\ncorruption and fraud;\nnationalization or loss of\nlicenses; potential criminal\ncharges; closure of branches\nor subsidiaries; and\nconfiscation of assets; and\nthese risks can be exacerbated\nin the event of a\ndeterioration in the\nrelationship between the U.S.\nand an emerging market\ncountry.\n\nFor example, Citi operates in\nseveral countries that have,\nor have had in the past,\nstrict capital controls,\ncurrency controls and/or\nsanctions, such as Argentina\nand Russia, that limit its\nability to convert local\ncurrency into U.S. dollars\nand/or transfer funds outside\nof those countries. For\ninstance, Citi may need to\nrecord additional translation\nlosses due to currency\ncontrols in Argentina (see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nbelow). Moreover, Citi may\nneed to record additional\nreserves for expected losses\nfor its credit exposures based\non the transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S., driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law (see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Russia\u201d and \u201cSignificant\nAccounting\n\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below).\n\nIn addition, political turmoil\nand instability; geopolitical\nchallenges, tensions and\nconflicts (including those\nrelated to Russia\u2019s war in\nUkraine as well as a\npersistent and/or escalating\nconflict in the Middle East);\nterrorism; and other\ninstabilities have occurred in\nvarious regions and emerging\nmarket countries across the\nglobe, which impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\nconditions in affected\ncountries and have required,\nand may continue to require,\nmanagement time and attention\nand other resources, such as\nmanaging the impact of\nsanctions and their effect on\nCiti\u2019s operations in certain\nemerging market countries.

The performance management and\nincentive compensation processes and associated policies and\nframeworks have enhanced accountability through increased rigor\nand consistency, in particular for risk and controls.\n\nThe culture shift is supported by changes in the way Citi\nidentifies, assesses, develops and promotes talent, particularly\nat senior levels of the Company. Citi promotes a new class of\nmanaging directors each year. This is a testament to these\nindividuals\u2019 performance and commitment to living the Leadership\nPrinciples and instilling them throughout their teams and the\nentire company. Further, all potential successors to Executive\nManagement Team roles are evaluated by the Board and are now\nsubject to a risk and controls assessment.\n                                                                \n  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion                               \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s Board is committed to ensuring that the Board and\nCiti\u2019s Executive Management Team are composed of individuals\nwhose backgrounds reflect the diversity of Citi\u2019s employees,\ncustomers and other stakeholders. In addition, Citi has\ncontinued its efforts to support its globally diverse workforce,\nincluding, among other things, taking actions with respect to\npay equity, setting aspirational representation goals and the\nuse of diverse slates and hiring panels in recruiting.\n\nCiti\u2019s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues\nto reflect a workforce that represents the clients it serves\nglobally from all walks of life, backgrounds and origins.\nUnderstanding that diversity fuels the Company\u2019s culture and\nbusiness success, Citi\u2019s 2025 aspirational representation goals\nare embedded in its business strategy. Having aspirational goals\nacross all levels\u2014from early career through senior leadership\nroles\u2014will help ensure Citi not only has diverse talent in\nleadership roles but will also help build a diverse talent\npipeline for the future.\n\nThe Company constantly strives to ensure Citi remains a great\nplace to work, where people can thrive professionally and\npersonally. In 2023, Citi increased its unique Inclusion Network\nmembership by 23.8% and added 15 new global Inclusion Network\nchapters. The Company launched the Allyship 365 initiative,\nfocused on cultivating allyship year round and educating\ncolleagues on its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\nCiti values pay transparency and has taken significant action to\nprovide both managers and colleagues with greater clarity around\nCiti\u2019s compensation philosophy. Citi has introduced market-based\nsalary structures and bonus opportunity guidelines in various\ncountries worldwide, and posts salary ranges on all external\nU.S. job postings, which aligns with strategic objectives of pay\nequity and transparency. Citi also raised its U.S. minimum wage\nin 2022, the second broad-based increase in less than two years.\n\nIn addition, Citi has focused on measuring and addressing pay\nequity within the organization:\n\n\u2022 In 2018, Citi was the first major U.S. financial institution\nto publicly release the results of a pay equity review comparing\nits compensation of women to that of men, as well as U.S.\nminorities to U.S. non-minorities. Since 2018, Citi has\ncontinued to be transparent about pay equity, including\ndisclosing its unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap for both women and\nU.S. minorities. The raw gap measures the difference in median\ncompensation. The existence of Citi\u2019s raw pay gap reflects a\nneed to increase representation of women and U.S. minorities in\nsenior and higher-paying roles.\n\n\u2022 In 2023, due to its organizational and management\nsimplification initiatives, Citi paused its annual pay equity\nanalysis, as the Company continues the process of aligning roles\nto its new organizational structure. Citi looks forward to\nresuming routine pay equity reviews once that work is complete.\n\n\u2022 For historical context, Citi\u2019s 2022 pay equity review\ndetermined that on an adjusted basis, women globally are paid on\naverage more than 99% of what men are paid at Citi, and that\nthere was not a statistically significant difference in adjusted\ncompensation for U.S. minorities and non-minorities.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s 2022 raw pay gap analysis showed that the median pay\nfor women globally was 78% of the median for men, up from 74% in\n2021 and 2020. The median pay for U.S. minorities was more than\n97% of the median for non- minorities, which was up from just\nabove 96% in 2021 and 94% in 2020.\n                                                                \n  Workforce Development                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s numerous programmatic offerings aim to reinforce its\nculture and values, foster understanding of compliance\nrequirements and develop competencies required to deliver\nexcellence to its clients. Citi encourages career growth and\ndevelopment by offering broad and diverse opportunities to\ncolleagues, including the following:\n\n\u2022 Citi provides a range of internal development and rotational\nprograms to colleagues at all levels, including an extensive\nleadership curriculum, allowing the opportunity to build the\nskills needed to transition to supervisory and managerial roles.\nCiti\u2019s tuition assistance program further enables colleagues in\nNorth America to pursue their educational goals.\n\n\u2022 Citi continues to focus on internal talent development and\naims to provide colleagues with career growth opportunities. Of\nthe 44,600 mobility opportunities filled in 2023, 14% were open\nroles applied for and filled by internal candidates, and 38%\nwere filled by colleagues who applied for, and were promoted\ninto, new opportunities. These opportunities are particularly\nimportant as Citi focuses on providing career paths for its\n\ninternal talent base as part of its efforts to increase organic\ngrowth within the organization.\n\n\u2022 Citi enabled Development Plans for colleagues of all levels.\nLast year, more than 100,000 employees completed a plan, setting\na roadmap for how they can achieve their career aspirations.\n                                                                \n  Well-being and Benefits                                       \n                                                                \nCiti is proud to provide a wide range of benefits that support\nits colleagues\u2019 mental, emotional, physical and financial well-\nbeing through various life stages and events. Citi is focused on\nproviding equitable benefits that are designed to attract,\nengage and retain colleagues.\n\nCiti has significantly enhanced mental well-being programs by\noffering free, accessible counseling sessions for colleagues and\ntheir family members, as well as offering an online tool so that\nall colleagues around the globe can easily find their local\nEmployee Assistance Programs and resources. Citi offers\ninstructor-led mental health training for people managers to\nequip them in supporting their team members.\n\nCiti also continues to value the importance of physical well-\nbeing\u2014providing employees in several office locations and\ncountries access to onsite medical care clinics, fitness\ncenters, subsidized gym memberships and virtual fitness\nprograms. Citi continues to make modern telemedicine programs\nincreasingly available to colleagues and their family members\nthrough programs like Sword Health\u2019s digital physical therapy,\nwhich rolled out in the U.S. in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, one year after the Company became the first major U.S.\nbank to publicly embrace a flexible, hybrid work model, Citi\nfully implemented it across the organization. Most of Citi\u2019s\ncolleagues now work in hybrid roles, working remotely up to two\ndays a week. How We Work provides the majority of colleagues\nwith the ability to balance the demands of their home lives with\nthe work commitments that are necessary for success. The program\nincludes three role designations for colleagues globally:\nResident, Hybrid or Remote. The implementation and continuation\nof this program differentiates Citi from other financial\norganizations with respect to flexible working arrangements. By\nembracing a flexible model of work, Citi has focused on keeping\nits approach consistent and aligned with its values and\npriorities.\n\nFor additional information about Citi\u2019s human capital management\ninitiatives and goals, see Citi\u2019s 2022 ESG Report available at\nwww.citigroup.com.

overall\noperations. Accordingly, Citi\nhas established an Enterprise\nRisk Management (ERM)\nFramework to ensure that all\nof Citi\u2019s risks are managed\nappropriately and consistently\nacross the Company and at an\naggregate, enterprise-wide\nlevel. Citi\u2019s culture drives a\nstrong risk and control\nenvironment, and is at the\nheart of the ERM Framework,\nunderpinning the way Citi\nconducts business. The\nactivities that Citi engages\nin, and the risks those\nactivities generate, must be\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s Mission\nand Value Proposition (see\nbelow) and the key Leadership\nPrinciples that support it, as\nwell as Citi\u2019s risk appetite.\nAs discussed above, Citi also\ncontinues its efforts to\ncomply with the FRB and OCC\nconsent orders, relating\nprincipally to various aspects\nof risk management,\ncompliance, data quality\nmanagement and governance, and\ninternal controls (see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Compliance\nRisks\u201d above).\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition, which was\ndeveloped by its senior\nleadership and distributed\nthroughout the Company, Citi\nstrives to serve its clients\nas a trusted partner by\nresponsibly providing\nfinancial services that enable\ngrowth and economic progress\nwhile earning and maintaining\nthe public\u2019s trust by\nconstantly adhering to the\nhighest ethical standards. As\nsuch, Citi asks all colleagues\nto ensure that their decisions\npass three tests: they are in\nCiti\u2019s clients\u2019 best\ninterests, create economic\nvalue and are always\nsystemically responsible.\n\nAs discussed in \u201cHuman Capital\nResources and Management\u201d\nabove, Citi has designed\nLeadership Principles that\nrepresent the qualities,\nbehaviors and expectations all\nemployees must exhibit to\ndeliver on Citi\u2019s mission of\nenabling growth and economic\nprogress. The Leadership\nPrinciples inform Citi\u2019s ERM\nFramework and contribute to\ncreating a culture that drives\nclient, control and\noperational excellence. Citi\ncolleagues share a common\nresponsibility to uphold these\nLeadership Principles and hold\nthemselves to the highest\nstandards of ethics and\nprofessional behavior in\ndealing with Citi\u2019s clients,\nbusiness colleagues,\nshareholders, communities and\neach other.\n\nCiti\u2019s ERM Framework details\nthe principles used to support\neffective enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement across the end-to-\nend risk management lifecycle.\nThe ERM Framework covers the\nrisk management roles and\nresponsibilities of the\nCitigroup Board of Directors\n(the Board), Citi\u2019s Executive\nManagement Team (see \u201cRisk\nGovernance\u2014Executive\nManagement Team\u201d below) and\nemployees across the lines of\ndefense. The underlying\npillars of the framework\nencompass:\n\n\u2022 Culture \u2014the core principles\nand behaviors that underpin a\nstrong culture of risk\nawareness, in line with Citi\u2019s\nMission and Value Proposition,\nand Leadership Principles;\n\n\u2022 Governance \u2014the committee\nstructure and reporting\narrangements that support the\nappropriate oversight of risk\nmanagement activities at the\nBoard and Executive Management\nTeam levels and establishes\nCiti\u2019s Lines of Defense model;\n\n\u2022 Risk Management \u2014the end-to-\nend risk management cycle\nincluding the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting of\nall risks including top,\nmaterial, growing,\nidiosyncratic and emerging\nrisks, and aggregated to an\nenterprise-wide level; and\n\n\u2022 Enterprise Programs \u2014the key\nrisk management programs\nperformed across the risk\nmanagement lifecycle for all\nrisk categories.\n\nEach of these pillars is\nunderpinned by supporting\ncapabilities covering people,\ninfrastructure and tools that\nare in place to enable the\nexecution of the ERM\nFramework.\n\nCiti\u2019s approach to risk\nmanagement requires that its\nrisk-taking be consistent with\nits risk appetite. Risk\nappetite is the aggregate\nlevel of risk that Citi is\nwilling to tolerate in order\nto achieve its strategic\nobjectives and business plan.\nRisk limits and thresholds\nrepresent allocations of\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite to\nbusinesses and risk\ncategories. Concentration\nrisks are controlled through a\nsubset of these limits and\nthresholds.\n\nCiti\u2019s risks are generally\ncategorized and summarized as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Credit risk is the risk of\nloss resulting from the\ndecline in credit quality (or\ndowngrade risk) or failure of\na borrower, counterparty,\nthird party or issuer to honor\nits financial or contractual\nobligations.\n\n\u2022 Liquidity risk is the risk\nthat Citi will not be able to\nefficiently meet both expected\nand unexpected current and\nfuture cash flow and\ncollateral needs without\nadversely affecting either\ndaily operations or financial\nconditions of Citi. Risk may\nbe exacerbated by the\ninability of the Company to\naccess funding sources or\nmonetize assets and the\ncomposition of liability\nfunding and liquid assets.\n\n\u2022 Market risk ( Trading and\nNon-Trading ): Market risk of\ntrading portfolios is the risk\nof loss arising from changes\nin the value of Citi\u2019s assets\nand liabilities resulting from\nchanges in market variables,\nsuch as interest rates, equity\nand commodity prices, foreign\nexchange rates or credit\nspreads. Market risk of non-\ntrading portfolios is the\nimpact of adverse changes in\nmarket variables such as\ninterest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, credit spreads\nand equity prices on Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income, economic\nvalue of equity, or AOCI .\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems,\nor from external events. It\nincludes legal risk, which is\nthe risk of loss (including\nlitigation costs, settlements\nand regulatory fines)\nresulting from Citi\u2019s failure\nto comply with laws,\nregulations, prudent ethical\nstandards or contractual\nobligations in any aspect of\nCiti\u2019s business, but excludes\nstrategic and reputation risks\n(see below).\n\n\u2022 Compliance risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial condition and\nresilience arising from\nviolations of laws, rules or\nregulations, or from non-\nconformance with prescribed\npractices, internal policies\nand procedures or ethical\nstandards.\n\n\u2022 Reputation risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial conditions and\nresilience from negative\nopinion held by\n                               65                               \nstakeholders. This risk may\nimpair Citi\u2019s competitiveness\nby affecting its ability to\nestablish new relationships or\nservices or continue servicing\nexisting relationships.\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk\nof a sustained impact (not\nepisodic impact) to Citi\u2019s\ncore strategic objectives as\nmeasured by impacts on\nanticipated earnings, market\ncapitalization or capital,\narising from the external\nfactors affecting the\nCompany\u2019s operating\nenvironment; as well as the\nrisks associated with defining\nthe strategy and executing the\nstrategy, which are\nidentified, measured and\nmanaged as part of the\nStrategic Risk Framework at\nthe Enterprise Level.\n\nCiti uses a lines of defense\nmodel as a key component of\nits ERM Framework to manage\nits risks. As discussed below,\nthe lines of defense model\nbrings together risk-taking,\nrisk oversight and risk\nassurance under one umbrella\nand provides an avenue for\nrisk accountability of the\nfirst line of defense, a\nconstruct for effective\nchallenge by the second line\nof defense (Independent Risk\nManagement and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management),\nand empowers independent risk\nassurance by the third line of\ndefense (Internal Audit). In\naddition, the lines of defense\nmodel includes organizational\nunits tasked with supporting a\nstrong control environment\n(\u201centerprise support\nfunctions\u201d). The first, second\nand third lines of defense,\nalong with enterprise support\nfunctions, have distinct roles\nand responsibilities and are\nempowered to perform relevant\nrisk management processes and\nresponsibilities in order to\nmanage Citi\u2019s risks in a\nconsistent and effective\nmanner.\n\nFirst Line of Defense: Front\nLine Units and Front Line Unit\nActivities\n\nCiti\u2019s first line of defense\nowns the risks and associated\ncontrols inherent in, or\narising from, the execution of\nits business activities and is\nresponsible for identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting\nthose risks consistent with\nCiti\u2019s strategy, Mission and\nValue Proposition, Leadership\nPrinciples and risk appetite.\n\nFront line units are\nresponsible and held\naccountable for managing the\nrisks associated with their\nactivities within the\nboundaries set by independent\nrisk management. They are also\nresponsible for designing and\nimplementing effective\ninternal controls and\nmaintaining processes for\nmanaging their risk profile,\nincluding through risk\nmitigation, so that it remains\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\nestablished risk appetite.\n\nFront line unit activities are\nconsidered part of the first\nline of defense and are\nsubject to the oversight and\nchallenge of independent risk\nmanagement.\n\nThe first line of defense is\ncomposed of Citi\u2019s operating\nsegments (i.e., Services ,\nMarkets , Banking , U.S.\nPersonal Banking , Wealth ),\nas well as Client, Legacy\nFranchises and certain\ncorporate functions (i.e.,\nChief Operating Office,\nEnterprise Services and Public\nAffairs, Finance, Operations\nand Technology). In addition,\nthe first line of defense\nincludes the front line unit\nactivities of other\norganizational units. Front\nline units may also include\nenterprise support units\nand/or conduct enterprise\nsupport activities\u2014see\n\u201cEnterprise Support Functions\u201d\nbelow.\n\nSecond Line of Defense:\nIndependent Risk Management\nIndependent risk management\nunits are independent of the\nfirst line of defense. They\nare responsible for overseeing\nthe risk-taking activities of\nthe first line of defense and\nchallenging the first line of\ndefense in the execution of\nits risk management\nresponsibilities. They are\nalso responsible for\nindependently identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting\naggregate risks and for\nsetting standards for the\nmanagement and oversight of\nrisk. Independent risk\nmanagement is composed of\nIndependent Risk Management\n(IRM) and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management\n(ICRM), which are led by the\nGroup Chief Risk Officer (CRO)\nand Group Chief Compliance\nOfficer (CCO) who have\nunrestricted access to the\nBoard and its Risk Management\nCommittee to facilitate the\nability to execute their\nspecific responsibilities\npertaining to escalation to\nthe Board.\n                                                                \n  Independent Risk Management                                   \n                                                                \nThe IRM organization sets risk\nand control standards for the\nfirst line of defense and\nactively manages and oversees\naggregate credit, market\n(trading and non-trading),\nliquidity, strategic,\noperational and reputation\nrisks across Citi, including\nrisks that span categories,\nsuch as concentration risk,\ncountry risk and climate risk.\n\nIRM is organized to align to\nrisk categories, legal\nentities/regions and Company-\nwide, cross-risk functions or\nprocesses. Each of these units\nreports to a member of the\nRisk Management Executive\nCouncil, who are all direct\nreports to the Citigroup CRO.\n                                                                \n  Independent Compliance Risk Management                        \n                                                                \nThe ICRM organization actively\noversees compliance risk\nacross Citi, sets compliance\nstandards for the first line\nof defense to manage\ncompliance risk and promotes\nbusiness conduct and activity\nthat is consistent with Citi\u2019s\nMission and Value Proposition\nand the compliance risk\nappetite. Citi\u2019s objective is\nto embed an enterprise-wide\ncompliance risk management\nframework and culture that\nidentifies, measures,\nmonitors, controls and\nescalates compliance risk\nacross Citi.\n\nICRM is aligned by product\nline, function and geography\nto provide compliance risk\nmanagement advice and credible\nchallenge on day-to-day\nmatters and strategic\ndecision-making for key\ninitiatives. ICRM also has\nprogram-level Enterprise\nCompliance units responsible\nfor setting standards and\nestablishing priorities for\nprogram-related compliance\nefforts. The CCO reports to\nCiti\u2019s General Counsel and\nICRM is organizationally part\nof the Global Legal Affairs &\nCompliance group. In addition,\nthe CCO has matrix reporting\ninto the CRO and is part of\nthe Risk Management Executive\nCouncil.\n                                                                \n  Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit                         \n                                                                \nInternal Audit is independent\nof the first line, second line\nand enterprise support\nfunctions. The role of\nInternal Audit is to provide\nindependent, objective,\nreliable, valued and timely\nassurance to the Board, its\nAudit Committee, Citi senior\nmanagement and regulators over\nthe effectiveness of\ngovernance, risk management\nand controls that mitigate\ncurrent and evolving risks and\nenhance the control culture\nwithin Citi. The Citi Chief\nAuditor manages Internal Audit\n                               66                               \nand reports functionally to\nthe Chair of the Citi Audit\nCommittee and administratively\nto the Citi Chief Executive\nOfficer. The Citi Chief\nAuditor has unrestricted\naccess to the Board and the\nBoard Audit Committee to\naddress risks and issues\nidentified through Internal\nAudit\u2019s activities.\n                                                                \n  Enterprise Support Functions                                  \n                                                                \nEnterprise support functions\nengage in activities that\nsupport safety and soundness\nacross Citi. These functions\nprovide advisory services\nand/or design, implement,\nmaintain and oversee Company-\nwide programs that support\nCiti in maintaining an\neffective control environment.\n\nEnterprise support functions\nare composed of Human\nResources and Global Legal\nAffairs and Compliance\n(exclusive of ICRM, which is\npart of the second line of\ndefense). Front line units may\nalso include enterprise\nsupport units and/or conduct\nenterprise support activities\n(e.g., the Controllers Group\nwithin Finance).\n\nEnterprise support functions,\nunits and activities are\nsubject to the relevant\nCompany-wide independent\noversight processes specific\nto the risks for which they\nare accountable (e.g.,\noperational risk, compliance\nrisk, reputation risk).\n                                                                \n  Risk Governance                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ERM Framework\nencompasses risk management\nprocesses to address risks\nundertaken by Citi through\nidentification, measurement,\nmonitoring, controlling and\nreporting of all risks. The\nERM Framework integrates these\nprocesses with appropriate\ngovernance to complement\nCiti\u2019s commitment to\nmaintaining strong and\nconsistent risk management\npractices.\n                                                                \n  Board Oversight                                               \n                                                                \nThe Board is responsible for\noversight of Citi and holds\nthe Executive Management Team\naccountable for implementing\nthe ERM Framework and meeting\nstrategic objectives within\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite.\n                                                                \n  Executive Management Team                                     \n                                                                \nThe Citigroup CEO directs and\noversees the day-to-day\nmanagement of Citi as\ndelegated by the Board of\nDirectors.

Credit risk is\none of the most significant\nrisks Citi faces as an\ninstitution (see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Credit Risks\u201d above).\nCredit risk arises in many of\nCitigroup\u2019s business\nactivities, including: \u2022\nconsumer, commercial and\ncorporate lending; \u2022 capital\nmarkets derivative\ntransactions; \u2022 structured\nfinance; and \u2022 securities\nfinancing transactions\n(repurchase and reverse\nrepurchase agreements, and\nsecurities loaned and\nborrowed). Credit risk also\narises from clearing and\nsettlement activities, when\nCiti transfers an asset in\nadvance of receiving its\ncounter-value or advances\nfunds to settle a transaction\non behalf of a client.\nConcentration risk, within\ncredit risk, is the risk\nassociated with having credit\nexposure concentrated within a\nspecific client, industry,\nregion or other category. Citi\nhas an established framework\nin place for managing credit\nrisk across all businesses\nthat includes a defined risk\nappetite, credit limits and\ncredit policies. Citi\u2019s credit\nrisk management framework also\nincludes policies and\nprocedures to manage problem\nexposures. To manage\nconcentration risk, Citi has\nin place a framework\nconsisting of industry limits,\nsingle-name concentrations for\neach business and across\nCitigroup and a specialized\nproduct limit framework.\nCredit exposures are generally\nreported in notional terms for\naccrual loans, reflecting the\nvalue at which the loans as\nwell as other off-balance\nsheet commitments are carried\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit exposure arising\nfrom capital markets\nactivities is generally\nexpressed as the current mark-\nto-market, net of margin,\nreflecting the net value owed\nto Citi by a given\ncounterparty. The credit risk\nassociated with Citi\u2019s credit\nexposures is a function of the\nidiosyncratic creditworthiness\nof the obligor, as well as the\nterms and conditions of the\nspecific obligation. Citi\nassesses the credit risk\nassociated with its credit\nexposures on a regular basis\nthrough its allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL) process\n(see \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d below and Notes 1 and\n16), as well as through\nregular stress testing at the\ncompany, business, geography\nand product levels. These\nstress-testing processes\ntypically estimate potential\nincremental credit costs that\nwould occur as a result of\neither downgrades in the\ncredit quality or defaults of\nthe obligors or\ncounterparties.

Citi has taken action to\nadjust internal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

In advance of the\nexpiration of partial-term\neconomic hedges, Citi will\ndetermine, among other\nfactors, the economic\nfeasibility of hedging the\nremaining life of the\ninstrument. The results of the\nmark-to-market and any\nrealized gains or losses on\ncredit derivatives are\nreflected primarily in\nPrincipal transactions in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome. At December 31, 2023,\nSeptember 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, Banking had\neconomic hedges on the\ncorporate credit portfolio of\n$35.9 billion, $36.0 billion\nand $39.8 billion,\nrespectively.

The\nportfolio is generally\ndelinquency managed, where\nCiti evaluates credit risk\nbased on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 15. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe net credit loss rate in\nRetail Banking for the fourth\nquarter of 2023 was broadly\nstable quarter-over-quarter\nand increased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the growth\nand seasoning of personal\nloans. The 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate was broadly\nstable quarter-over-quarter\nand decreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by lower\ndelinquencies in U.S.\nmortgages.\n          \n  Wealth  \n          \nAs indicated above, Wealth\nprovides consumer mortgages,\nmargin lending, cards and\nother lending products to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom affluent to ultra-high\nnet worth through the Private\nBank, Wealth at Work and\nCitigold. These customer\nsegments represent a target\nmarket that is characterized\nby historically low default\nrates and delinquencies and\nincludes loans that are\ndelinquency managed or\nclassifiably managed. The\ndelinquency-managed portfolio\nconsists primarily of\nmortgages, margin lending and\ncards. As of December 31,\n2023, approximately $46\nbillion, or 30%, of the\nportfolio was classifiably\nmanaged and primarily\nconsisted of margin lending,\ncommercial real estate,\nsubscription credit finance\nand other lending programs.\nThese classifiably managed\nloans are primarily evaluated\nfor credit\n\nrisk based on their internal\nrisk rating, of which 85% is\nrated investment grade. While\nthe delinquency rate in the\nchart above is calculated only\nfor the delinquency-managed\nportfolio, the net credit loss\nrate is calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe net credit loss rate and\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate in Wealth for the fourth\nquarter of 2023 were broadly\nstable quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year. The low\nnet credit loss and the 90+\ndays past due delinquency\nrates continued to reflect the\nstrong credit profiles of the\nportfolios.\n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex and\nprovides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nMexico Consumer serves a more\nmass-market segment in Mexico\nand focuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As presented\nin the chart above, the fourth\nquarter of 2023 net credit\nloss rate in Mexico Consumer\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the ongoing\nnormalization of loss rates\nfrom post-pandemic lows. The\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate was relatively stable\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $63 million ($0.5 billion), $89 million ($0.6\nbillion) and $185 million ($1.1 billion) at December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans\n30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans have the\nsame adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $73\nmillion, $70 million and $74 million at December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the\nguaranteed loans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail\nServices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status, and therefore\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of December\n31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 85%, 96% and 94% of Wealth classifiably\nmanaged loans were rated investment grade. For additional\ninformation on the credit quality of the Wealth portfolio,\nincluding classifiably managed portfolios, see \u201cConsumer Credit\nTrends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and\nRussia for all periods presented and in Bahrain for 2021 only.\n\n(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nConsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nreclassifications commenced as follows: Bahrain, India,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22\n(Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and\nVietnam closed in 1Q23; Taiwan closed in 3Q23; and Indonesia\nclosed in 4Q23); Australia in 3Q21 (closed in 2Q22); and the\nPhilippines in 4Q21 (closed in 3Q22). In addition, a portfolio\nwas reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023 and\nsubsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 2.\n                               80                               \n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies.

Update\n(ASU) 2022-02, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nTDRs and Vintage Disclosures . The ASU eliminated the accounting\nand disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement\nto measure the ACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF)\napproach. On January 1, 2023, Citi recorded a $352 million\ndecrease in the Allowance for loan losses , along with a $290\nmillion after-tax increase to Retained earnings . See Note 1.\n\n(2) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(CECL) . The ASC introduces a new credit loss methodology\nrequiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also\nproviding additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1,\n2020, Citi recorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%,\npretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses , along with\na $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a\ndeferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due\nto longer estimated tenors than under the incurred loss\nmethodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries, and (ii) a\n$0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter\nremaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more\nspecific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies.\n\n(3) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable\npost-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded\nas an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening allowance for\ncredit losses on loans of $443 million.\n\n(4) Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses,\nsuch as changes in the allowance from acquisitions,\ndispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase\naccounting adjustments, etc.\n\n(5) 2023 includes an approximate $175 million increase related\nto FX translation.\n\n(6) 2022 includes an approximate $350 million reclass related to\nthe announced sales of Citi\u2019s consumer banking businesses in\nThailand, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Bahrain and\nVietnam. Also includes a decrease of approximately $100 million\nrelated to FX translation.\n\n(7) 2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to\nCiti\u2019s agreement to sell its Australia consumer banking business\nand an approximate $90 million reclass related to Citi\u2019s\nagreement to sell its Philippines consumer banking business.\nThose ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during 2021. 2021\nalso includes a decrease of approximately $134 million related\nto FX translation.\n\n(8) 2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related\nto the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios.\nIn addition, 2020 includes an increase of approximately $97\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(9) 2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios. In addition, 2019 includes a reduction of\napproximately $60 million related to FX translation.\n\n(10) December 31, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019 exclude $7.6\nbillion, $5.4 billion, $6.1 billion, $6.9 billion and $4.1\nbillion, respectively, of loans that are carried at fair value.\n\n(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(12) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of\n$68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees.\nThe reserves on these contracts were reclassified out of the ACL\non unfunded lending commitments and into Other liabilities .\n\n(13) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nand troubled debt restructurings. See \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant Estimates.\u201d Attribution of the ACLL is\nmade for analytical purposes only and the entire ACLL is\navailable to absorb credit losses in the overall portfolio.\nPrior to 2020, the ACLL represented management\u2019s estimate of\nprobable losses inherent in the portfolio, as well as probable\nlosses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans\nand TDRs.\n                               85                               \n                                                                \n  Allowance for Credit Losses

The\nfollowing summary provides a\ngeneral description of each\ncategory:\n\n\u2022 Corporate and consumer\n(including commercial banking)\nnon-accrual status is based on\nthe determination that payment\nof interest or principal is\ndoubtful.\n\n\u2022 A corporate loan may be\nclassified as non-accrual and\nstill be current on principal\nand interest payments under\nthe terms of the loan\nstructure. Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans were $1.9\nbillion, $2.0 billion and $1.1\nbillion as of December 31,\n2023, September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\n\n\u2022 Consumer non-accrual status\nis generally based on aging,\ni.e., the borrower has fallen\nbehind on payments.\n\n\u2022 Consumer mortgage loans,\nother than Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA)\u2013insured\nloans, are classified as non-\naccrual within 60 days of\nnotification that the borrower\nhas filed for bankruptcy. In\naddition, home equity loans\nare classified as non-accrual\nif the related residential\nfirst mortgage loan is 90 days\nor more past due.\n\n\u2022 U.S. Branded Cards and\nRetail Services are not\nincluded because, under\nindustry standards, credit\ncard loans accrue interest\nuntil such loans are charged\noff, which typically occurs at\n180 days of contractual\ndelinquency.\n                               88                               \n                                                                \n  Non-Accrual Loans                                             \n                                                                \nThe table below summarizes\nCitigroup\u2019s non-accrual loans\nas of the periods indicated.\nNon-accrual loans may still be\ncurrent on interest payments.\nIn situations where Citi\nreasonably expects that only a\nportion of the principal owed\nwill ultimately be collected,\nall payments received are\nreflected as a reduction of\nprincipal and not as interest\nincome.

As such, the non-\naccrual loan disclosures do\nnot include credit card loans.\nThe balances above represent\nnon-accrual loans within\nCorporate loans and Consumer\nloans on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\n\n(2) Approximately 50%, 50%,\n56%, 64% and 44% of Citi\u2019s\ncorporate non-accrual loans\nremain current on interest and\nprincipal payments at December\n31, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively.\n\n(3) The December 31, 2023\ntotal corporate non-accrual\nloans represented 0.63% of\ntotal corporate loans.\n\n(4) The increase at December\n31, 2023 was primarily related\nto two commercial real estate\nloans.\n\n(5) Asia Consumer includes\nbalances in Poland and Russia\nfor all periods presented and\nin Bahrain for December 31,\n2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nModified Loans to Borrowers\nExperiencing Financial\nDifficulty\n\nOn January 1, 2023, Citi\nadopted ASU 2022-02, which\neliminated the accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for\nTDRs (see Note 1).

The\nliquidity risk management\nframework provides that, in\naddition to the aggregate\nrequirements, certain entities\nbe self-sufficient or net\nproviders of liquidity,\nincluding in conditions\nestablished under their\ndesignated stress tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s primary funding sources\ninclude (i) corporate and\nconsumer deposits via Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries, including\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank),\n(ii) long-term debt (primarily\nsenior and subordinated debt)\nmainly issued by Citigroup\nInc., as the parent, and\nCitibank, and (iii)\nstockholders\u2019 equity. These\nsources may be supplemented by\nshort-term borrowings,\nprimarily in the form of\nsecured funding transactions.\n\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nframework, working in concert\nwith overall asset/liability\nmanagement, helps ensure that\nthere is sufficient liquidity\nand tenor in the overall\nliability structure (including\nfunding products) of the\nCompany relative to the\nliquidity requirements of\nCiti\u2019s assets. This reduces\nthe\n\nrisk that liabilities will\nbecome due before assets\nmature or are monetized. The\nCompany holds excess\nliquidity, primarily in the\nform of high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA), as presented in\nthe table below.\n\nCiti\u2019s liquidity is managed\ncentrally by Corporate\nTreasury, in conjunction with\nregional and in-country\ntreasurers with oversight\nprovided by Independent Risk\nManagement and various Asset &\nLiability Committees (ALCOs)\nat the individual entity,\nregion, country and business\nlevels. Pursuant to this\napproach, Citi\u2019s HQLA are\nmanaged with emphasis on\nasset/liability management and\nentity-level liquidity\nadequacy throughout Citi.\n\nCiti\u2019s CRO and CFO co-chair\nCitigroup\u2019s ALCO, which\nincludes Citi\u2019s Treasurer and\nother senior executives. The\nALCO sets the strategy of the\nliquidity portfolio and\nmonitors portfolio performance\n(see \u201cRisk Governance\u2014Board\nand Executive Management\nCommittees\u201d above).\nSignificant changes to\nportfolio asset allocations\nare approved by the ALCO. Citi\nalso has other ALCOs, which\nare established at various\norganizational levels to\nensure appropriate oversight\nfor individual entities,\ncountries, franchise\nbusinesses and regions,\nserving as the primary\ngovernance committees for\nmanaging Citi\u2019s balance sheet\nand liquidity.\n\nAs a supplement to ALCO,\nCiti\u2019s Funding and Liquidity\nRisk Committee (FLRC) is\nfocused on funding and\nliquidity risk matters. The\nFLRC reviews and discusses the\nfunding and liquidity risk\nprofile of, as well as risk\nmanagement practices for,\nCitigroup and Citibank and\nreports its findings and\nrecommendations to each\nrelevant ALCO as appropriate.\n                                                                \n  Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                \nLiquidity stress testing is\nperformed for each of Citi\u2019s\nmajor entities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries.\nStress testing and scenario\nanalyses are intended to\nquantify the potential impact\nof an adverse liquidity event\non the balance sheet and\nliquidity position, in order\nto have sufficient liquidity\non hand to manage through such\nan event. These scenarios\ninclude assumptions about\nsignificant changes in key\nfunding sources, market\ntriggers (such as credit\nratings), potential uses of\nfunding and macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nconditions. These conditions\ninclude expected and stressed\nmarket conditions as well as\nCompany-specific events.\n\nLiquidity stress tests are\nperformed to ascertain\npotential mismatches between\nliquidity sources and uses\nover a variety of time\nhorizons and over different\nstressed conditions. To\nmonitor the liquidity of an\nentity, these stress tests and\npotential mismatches are\ncalculated on a daily basis.\n\nGiven the range of potential\nstresses, Citi maintains\ncontingency funding plans on a\nconsolidated basis and for\nindividual entities. These\nplans specify a wide range of\nreadily available actions for\na variety of adverse market\nconditions or idiosyncratic\nstresses.\n                               91                               \n                                                                \n  High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nNote: The amounts in the table\nabove are presented on an\naverage basis. For securities,\nthe amounts represent the\nliquidity value that\npotentially could be realized\nand, therefore, exclude any\nsecurities that are encumbered\nand incorporate any haircuts\napplicable under the U.S. LCR\nrule.

Foreign government debt\nsecurities are held largely to\nsupport local liquidity\nrequirements and Citi\u2019s local\nfranchises and principally\ninclude government bonds from\nJapan, Korea, Mexico, India\nand Hong Kong.\n\nThe table above includes\naverage amounts of HQLA held\nat Citigroup\u2019s operating\nentities that are eligible for\ninclusion in the calculation\nof Citigroup\u2019s consolidated\nLiquidity Coverage ratio\n(LCR), pursuant to the U.S.\nLCR rules. These amounts\ninclude the HQLA needed to\nmeet the minimum requirements\nat these entities as well as\nany amounts in excess of these\nminimums that are available to\nbe transferred to other\nentities within Citigroup.\nCitigroup\u2019s average HQLA\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nas of the fourth quarter of\n2023, primarily driven by a\nreduction in average unsecured\ndebt. As of December 31, 2023,\nCitigroup had approximately\n$965 billion of available\nliquidity resources to support\nclient and business needs,\nincluding end-of-period HQLA\n($562 billion); additional\nunencumbered HQLA, including\nexcess liquidity held at bank\nentities that is non-\ntransferable to other entities\nwithin Citigroup ($232\nbillion); and unused borrowing\ncapacity from available assets\nnot already accounted for\nwithin Citi\u2019s HQLA to support\nadditional advances from the\nFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)\nand the Federal Reserve Bank\ndiscount window ($171\nbillion).\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR. The LCR is calculated by\ndividing HQLA by estimated net\noutflows assuming a stressed\n30-day period, with the net\noutflows determined by\nstandardized stress outflow\nand inflow rates prescribed in\nthe LCR rule. The outflows are\npartially offset by\ncontractual inflows from\nassets maturing within 30\ndays. Similar to outflows, the\ninflows are calculated based\non prescribed factors to\nvarious asset categories, such\nas retail loans as well as\nunsecured and secured\nwholesale lending. The minimum\nLCR requirement is 100%. The\ntable below details the\ncomponents of Citi\u2019s LCR\ncalculation and HQLA in excess\nof net outflows for the\nperiods indicated:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  billions                                                      \n  of              Dec. 31,        Sept. 30,        Dec. 31,     \n  dollars             2023             2023            2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  HQLA        $      560.5     $      569.3     $     575.2     \n  Net                482.7            485.3           489.0     \n  outflows                                                      \n  LCR                  116  %           117  %          118  %  \n  HQLA in                                                       \n  excess      $       77.8     $       84.0     $      86.2     \n  of net                                                        \n  outflows                                                      \n                                                                \nNote: The amounts are\npresented on an average basis.\nAs of December 31, 2023,\nCitigroup\u2019s average LCR\ndecreased from the quarter\nended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby the reduction in average\nHQLA . In addition,\nconsidering Citi\u2019s total\navailable liquidity resources\nat quarter end of $965\nbillion, Citi maintained\napproximately $482 billion of\nexcess liquidity above the\nstressed average net outflow\nof approximately $483 billion,\nshown in the LCR table above.\n                               92                               \nLong-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Net Stable\nFunding Ratio (NSFR) As\npreviously disclosed, the U.S.\nbanking agencies adopted a\nrule to assess the\navailability of a bank\u2019s\nstable funding against a\nrequired level. In general, a\nbank\u2019s available stable\nfunding includes portions of\nequity, deposits and long-term\ndebt, while its required\nstable funding will be based\non the liquidity\ncharacteristics of its assets,\nderivatives and commitments.\nStandardized weightings are\nrequired to be applied to the\nvarious asset and liability\nclasses. The ratio of\navailable stable funding to\nrequired stable funding is\nrequired to be greater than\n100%. For the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2023, Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated NSFR was\ncompliant with the rule.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued\nto third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup)\nand Citi\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries (including\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries)\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup. As of December 31,\n2023, non-bank included $92.6\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries that\nare consolidated into\nCitigroup. Certain Citigroup\nconsolidated hedging\nactivities are also included\nin this line. (2) Local\ncountry and other includes\ndebt issued by Citi\u2019s\naffiliates in support of their\nlocal operations. Within non-\nbank, certain secured\nfinancing is also included.\n(3) Predominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Branded Cards\nreceivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\nincreased 6% year-over-year,\nlargely driven by issuance of\ncustomer-related debt at the\nnon-bank entities, as well as\nincreased senior benchmark\ndebt and FHLB borrowings at\nthe bank. The increase was\npartially offset by a decline\nin senior benchmark debt at\nthe non-bank entities.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding also increased 4%,\nlargely driven by an increase\nin customer-related debt at\nthe non-bank entities and\nincreased FHLB borrowings and\nbenchmark senior debt at the\nbank. As part of its liability\nmanagement, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During 2023,\nCiti redeemed or repurchased\nan aggregate of approximately\n$32.0 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               94

FDIC and\nFederal Reserve Board (FRB) to\nperiodically submit a plan for\nCiti\u2019s rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event\nof material financial distress\nor failure. Citigroup will\nalternate between submitting a\nfull resolution plan and a\ntargeted resolution plan on a\nbiennial cycle.\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s preferred \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d resolution\nplan strategy, only Citigroup,\nthe parent holding company,\nwould enter into bankruptcy,\nwhile Citigroup\u2019s material\nlegal entities (as defined in\nthe public section of its 2023\nresolution plan, which can be\nfound on the FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s\nwebsites) would remain\noperational outside of any\nresolution or insolvency\nproceedings. Citigroup\u2019s\nresolution plan has been\ndesigned to minimize the risk\nof systemic impact to the U.S.\nand global financial systems,\nwhile maximizing the value of\nthe bankruptcy estate for the\nbenefit of Citigroup\u2019s\ncreditors, including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders.\n\nIn addition, in line with the\nFRB\u2019s total loss-absorbing\ncapacity (TLAC) rule,\nCitigroup\u2019s shareholders and\nunsecured creditors\u2014including\nits unsecured long-term debt\nholders\u2014bear any losses\nresulting from Citigroup\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Accordingly, any\nvalue realized by holders of\nits unsecured long-term debt\nmay not be sufficient to repay\nthe amounts owed to such debt\nholders in the event of a\nbankruptcy or other resolution\nproceeding of Citigroup.\n\nThe FDIC has also indicated\nthat it was developing a\nsingle point of entry strategy\nto implement the Orderly\nLiquidation Authority under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, which provides the FDIC\nwith the ability to resolve a\nfirm when it is determined\nthat bankruptcy would have\nserious adverse effects on\nfinancial stability in the\nU.S.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in\nresponse to feedback received\nfrom the FRB and FDIC,\nCitigroup took the following\nactions:\n\n(i) Citicorp LLC (Citicorp),\nan existing wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Citigroup, was\nestablished as an intermediate\nholding company (an IHC) for\ncertain of Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities;\n\n(ii) Citigroup executed an\ninter-affiliate agreement with\nCiticorp, Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities and certain other\naffiliated entities pursuant\nto which Citicorp is required\nto provide liquidity and\ncapital support to Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities in the event that\nCitigroup were to enter\nbankruptcy proceedings (Citi\nSupport Agreement);\n\n(iii) pursuant to the Citi\nSupport Agreement:\n\n\u2022 Citigroup made an initial\ncontribution of assets,\nincluding certain high-quality\nliquid assets and inter-\naffiliate loans (Contributable\nAssets), to Citicorp, and\nCiticorp became the business-\nas-usual funding vehicle for\nCitigroup\u2019s operating material\nlegal entities;\n\n\u2022 Citigroup will be obligated\nto continue to transfer\nContributable Assets to\nCiticorp over time, subject to\ncertain amounts retained by\nCitigroup to, among other\nthings, meet Citigroup\u2019s near-\nterm cash needs;\n\n\u2022 in the event of a Citigroup\nbankruptcy, Citigroup will be\nrequired to contribute most of\nits remaining assets to\nCiticorp; and\n\n(iv) the obligations of both\nCitigroup and Citicorp under\nthe Citi Support Agreement, as\nwell as the Contributable\nAssets, are secured pursuant\nto a security agreement.\n                                                                \n  Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)                          \n                                                                \nU.S. GSIBs are required to\nmaintain minimum levels of\nTLAC and eligible LTD, each\nset by reference to the GSIB\u2019s\nconsolidated risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and total\nleverage exposure. The\nintended purpose of the\nrequirements is to facilitate\nthe orderly resolution of U.S.\nGSIBs under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code and Title II\nof the Dodd-Frank Act.

Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $269\nbillion as of December 31,\n2023 increased 33% year-over-\nyear and 5% sequentially,\nlargely driven by additional\nfinancing to support increases\nin trading-related assets\nwithin Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries. As of the\nquarter ended December 31,\n2023, on an average basis,\nsecured funding was $288\nbillion. The portion of\nsecured funding in the broker-\ndealer subsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity and is primarily\nsecured by high-quality liquid\nsecurities such as U.S.\nTreasury securities, U.S.\nagency securities and foreign\ngovernment debt securities.\nOther \u201cmatched book\u201d activity\nis secured by less liquid\nsecurities, including equity\nsecurities, corporate bonds\nand asset-backed securities,\nthe tenor of which is\ngenerally equal to or longer\nthan the tenor of the\ncorresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $37 billion as of the\nfourth quarter of 2023\ndecreased 20% year-over-year,\nreflecting lower commercial\npaper issuances at the broker-\ndealer subsidiaries, as Citi\ncontinues to diversify its\nfunding profile, and decreased\n1% sequentially, driven by\nnormal business activity (see\nNote 18 for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               97                               \n                                                                \n  CREDIT RATINGS                                                \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, funding capacity,\nability to access capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds, the cost of these funds\nand its ability to maintain\ncertain deposits are partially\ndependent on its credit\nratings.\n\nThe table below presents the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of December 31,\n2023.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Liquidity Risks\u201d\nabove.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $0.2 billion,\ncompared to $0.3 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured financing transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely affected.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.3\nbillion, compared to $0.4\nbillion as of September 30,\n2023. Other funding sources,\nsuch as secured financing\ntransactions and other margin\nrequirements, for which there\nare no explicit triggers,\ncould also be adversely\naffected.\n\nIn total, as of December 31,\n2023, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank\nacross all three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$0.5 billion, compared to $0.7\nbillion as of September 30,\n2023 (see also Note 20). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings at certain Citibank\nsubsidiaries. Mitigating\nactions available to Citibank\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, selling or financing\nhighly liquid government\nsecurities, tailoring levels\nof secured lending, adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nassets, reducing loan\noriginations and renewals,\nraising additional deposits or\nborrowing from the FHLB or\ncentral banks. Citi believes\nthese mitigating actions could\nsubstantially reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above.\n                               98                               \n                                                                \n  Citibank\u2014Additional Potential Impacts                         \n                                                                \nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of December 31,\n2023, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximate ly\n$11.0 billion t o consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2022 (see Note 23\n).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               99                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nMarket risk is the potential\nfor losses arising from\nchanges in the value of Citi\u2019s\nassets and liabilities\nresulting from changes in\nmarket variables such as\ninterest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices,\ncommodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their\nimplied volatilities. Market\nrisk arises from both Citi\u2019s\ntrading and non-trading\nportfolios. For additional\ninformation on market risk and\nmarket risk management at\nCiti, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nabove.\n\nEach business is required to\nestablish, with approval from\nCiti\u2019s market risk management,\na market risk limit framework\nfor identified risk factors\nthat clearly defines approved\nrisk profiles and is within\nthe parameters of Citi\u2019s\noverall risk appetite. These\nlimits are monitored by the\nRisk organization, including\nvarious regional, legal entity\nand business Risk Management\ncommittees, Citi\u2019s country and\nbusiness Asset & Liability\nCommittees and the Citigroup\nRisk Management and Asset &\nLiability Committees. In all\ncases, the businesses are\nultimately responsible for the\nmarket risks taken and for\nremaining within their defined\nlimits.\n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS                         \n                                                                \nMarket risk from non-trading\nportfolios stems predominantly\nfrom the potential impact of\nchanges in interest rates and\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s net interest income and\non Citi\u2019s Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) from its investment\nsecurities portfolios. Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Banking Book Interest Rate Risk                               \n                                                                \nFor interest rate risk\npurposes, Citi\u2019s non-trading\nportfolios are referred to as\nthe Banking Book. Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset &\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from the second line\nof defense team reporting to\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in the level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rates\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in the maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in the interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nSince the third quarter of\n2022, Citi has employed\nenhanced IRE methodologies and\nchanges to certain\nassumptions. The changes\nincluded, among other things,\nassumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet and\nrevisions to the treatment of\ncertain business contributions\n(notably accrual positions in\nthe Markets businesses). These\nchanges resulted in a higher\nimpact to Citi\u2019s net interest\nincome over a 12-month period.\n\nUnder the enhanced\nmethodology, Citi utilizes the\nmost recent quarter-end\nbalance sheet, assuming no\nchanges to its composition and\nsize over the forecasted\nhorizon (holding the balance\nsheet static). The forecasts\nincorporate expectations and\nassumptions of deposit\npricing, loan spreads and\nmortgage prepayment behavior\nimplied by the interest rate\ncurves in each scenario. The\nbase case scenario reflects\nthe market-implied forward\ninterest rates, and\nsensitivity scenarios assume\ninstantaneous shocks to the\nbase case. The forecasts do\nnot assume Citi takes any\nrisk-mitigating actions in\nresponse to changes in the\ninterest rate environment.\nCertain interest rates are\nsubject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities (i.e., deposit\nbetas) are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n\nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nvalue at risk (VAR). It\nexcludes impacts from any\npositions that are included in\ntotal trading and credit\nportfolio VAR.\n\nIn addition to IRE, Citi\nanalyzes economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) as a longer-\nterm interest rate risk\nmetric. EVS is a net present\nvalue (NPV)\u2013based measure of\nthe lifetime cash flows of\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book. It\nestimates the interest rate\nsensitivity of the Banking\nBook\u2019s economic value from\nlonger-term assets being\npotentially funded with\nshorter-term liabilities, or\nvice versa.

This will impact\nCiti\u2019s CET1 and other\nregulatory capital ratios.\nCiti seeks to manage its\nexposure to changes in the\nmarket level of interest\nrates, while limiting the\npotential impact on its AOCI\nand regulatory capital\nposition.\n\nAOCI at risk is managed as\npart of the Company-wide\ninterest rate risk position.\nAOCI at risk considers\npotential changes in AOCI (and\nthe corresponding impact on\nthe CET1 Capital ratio)\nrelative to Citi\u2019s capital\ngeneration capacity.\n\nCiti uses 100 basis point\n(bps) shocks in each scenario\nto reflect its net interest\nincome sensitivity to\nunanticipated changes in\nmarket interest rates, as\npotential monetary policy\ndecisions and changes in\neconomic conditions may be\nreflected in current market-\nimplied forward rates.

These impacts\nper currency are generally in\nthe same direction (estimated\npositive impact in the +100\nbps shock scenario) and not\noffsetting.\n\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet is asset\nsensitive (assets reprice\nfaster than liabilities),\nresulting in higher net\ninterest income in increasing\ninterest rate scenarios. The\nestimated impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income in a 100 bps\nupward rate shock scenario as\nof December 31, 2023 decreased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily\nreflecting the net impact of\nlower expected gains due to\nU.S. dollar interest rate\nmoves that have already been\nrealized and changes in Citi\u2019s\nbalance sheet. At\nprogressively higher interest\nrate levels, the marginal net\ninterest income benefit is\nlower, as Citi assumes it will\npass on a larger share of rate\nchanges to depositors (i.e.,\nhigher betas), further\nreducing Citi\u2019s IRE\nsensitivity. Currency-specific\ninterest rate changes and\nbalance sheet factors may\ndrive quarter-to-quarter\nvolatility in Citi\u2019s estimated\nIRE.\n\nIn a 100 bps upward rate shock\nscenario, Citi expects that\nthe approximate $0.8 billion\ninitial negative impact to\nAOCI could potentially be\noffset in shareholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio and expected net\ninterest income benefit over a\nperiod of approximately four\nmonths.\n                              101                               \n                                                                \n  Scenario Analysis                                             \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income, AOCI and\nCET1 Capital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under six\ndifferent scenarios of changes\nin interest rates for the U.S.\ndollar and all other\ncurrencies in which Citi has\ninvested capital as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d).

Conversely,\nin lower interest rate\nscenarios, customer activity\nresulting in a shift from\nhigher-yielding deposits to\nnon-interest-bearing and low\ninterest rate deposit products\nwould reduce the expected\ndecrease to net interest\nincome.\n\n(1) Scenario 1 includes the\nimpact from the following top\nsix non-U.S. dollar\ncurrencies, which represents\napproximately 50% of the total\nnon-U.S. dollar currency\nimpact: approximately $0.2\nbillion from the Japanese yen,\nand approximately $0.1 billion\neach from the Indian rupee,\nSingapore dollar, Korean won,\nSwiss franc and Chinese yuan.\nThese impacts per currency are\ngenerally in the same\ndirection (estimated positive\nimpact in the +100 bps shock\nscenario) and not offsetting.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs presented in the table\nabove, the estimated impact to\nCiti\u2019s net interest income is\nlarger under Scenario 2 than\nScenario 3, as Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook has relatively higher\ninterest rate exposure to the\nshort end of the yield curve.\nFor U.S. dollars, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is larger\nin magnitude than to upward\nrate shocks. This is because\nof the lower benefit to net\ninterest income from Citi\u2019s\ndeposit base at higher rate\nlevels, as well as the\nprepayment effects on mortgage\nloans and mortgage-backed\nsecurities. For other non-U.S.\ndollar currencies, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is\nsmaller in magnitude as a\nresult of Citi\u2019s flooring\nassumption, given low rate\nlevels for certain non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 compared to Scenario 3. This\nis because the combination of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio, partially offset by\nchanges related to Citi\u2019s\npension liabilities, results\nin a net position that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                              102                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI\n                                                                \n  and Capital                                                   \n                                                                \nAs of December 31, 2023, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.7 billion,\nor 1.0%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\nMexican peso, Euro, Singapore\ndollar and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency translation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies.\n\nThis, coupled with Citi\u2019s\nforeign currency hedging\nstrategies, such as foreign\ncurrency borrowings, foreign\ncurrency forwards and other\ncurrency hedging instruments,\nlessens the impact of foreign\ncurrency movements on Citi\u2019s\nCET1 Capital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are presented\nin the table below.

Citi\u2019s net\ninterest margin was 2.46% on a\ntaxable equivalent basis in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023, a\ndecrease of three basis points\nfrom the prior quarter,\nlargely driven by higher\ndeposit costs, partially\noffset by higher Markets net\ninterest margin.\n\nCiti\u2019s net interest income for\n2023 increased 13%, or\napproximately $6.2 billion, to\n$54.9 billion ($55.0 billion\non a taxable equivalent basis)\nversus the prior year. The\nincrease was primarily due to\nan increase in non- Markets\nnet interest income, largely\nreflecting higher interest\nrates and higher loan balances\nin USPB . In 2023, Citi\u2019s net\ninterest margin increased to\n2.46% on a taxable equivalent\nbasis, compared to 2.25% in\n2022, primarily driven by\nhigher interest rates and a\nmix-shift in balances.\n

It\nexcludes DVA, FVA and CVA\nadjustments incurred due to\nchanges in the credit quality\nof counterparties, as well as\nany associated hedges of that\nCVA. In addition, it excludes\nfees and other revenue\nassociated with capital\nmarkets origination\nactivities. Trading-related\nrevenues are driven by both\ncustomer flows and the changes\nin valuation of the trading\ninventory. As presented in the\nchart below, positive trading-\nrelated revenue was achieved\nfor 94.6% of the trading days\nin 2023.\n                                                     \n  Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss)(1)\u201412 Months  \n  Ended December 31, 2023                            \n  In millions of dollars                             \n                                                     \n(1) Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic\nhedges of certain AFS debt securities.

Citi\u2019s Global Market\nRisk function, within the\nIndependent Risk Management\norganization, works to ensure\nthat factor sensitivities are\ncalculated, monitored and\nlimited for all material risks\ntaken in the trading\nportfolios.\n                                                                \n  Value at Risk (VAR)                                           \n                                                                \nVAR estimates, at a 99%\nconfidence level, the\npotential decline in the value\nof a position or a portfolio\nunder normal market conditions\nassuming a one-day holding\nperiod. VAR statistics, which\nare based on historical data,\ncan be materially different\nacross firms due to\ndifferences in portfolio\ncomposition, VAR methodologies\nand model parameters. As a\nresult, Citi believes VAR\nstatistics can be used more\neffectively as indicators of\ntrends in risk-taking within a\nfirm, rather than as a basis\nfor inferring differences in\nrisk-taking across firms.\n\nCiti uses a single,\nindependently approved Monte\nCarlo simulation VAR model\n(see \u201cVAR Model Review and\nValidation\u201d below), which has\nbeen designed to capture\n\nmaterial risk sensitivities\n(such as first- and second-\norder sensitivities of\npositions to changes in market\nprices) of various asset\nclasses/risk types (such as\ninterest rate, credit spread,\nforeign exchange, equity and\ncommodity risks). Citi\u2019s VAR\nincludes positions that are\nmeasured at fair value; it\ndoes not include investment\nsecurities classified as AFS\nor HTM. See Note 14 for\ninformation on these\nsecurities.\n\nCiti believes its VAR model is\nconservatively calibrated to\nincorporate fat-tail scaling\nand the greater of short-term\n(approximately the most recent\nmonth) and long-term (18\nmonths for commodities and\nthree years for others) market\nvolatility. The Monte Carlo\nsimulation involves\napproximately 550,000 market\nfactors, making use of\napproximately 480,000 time\nseries, with sensitivities\nupdated daily, volatility\nparameters updated intra-\nmonthly and correlation\nparameters updated monthly.\nThe conservative features of\nthe VAR calibration contribute\nan approximate 30% add-on to\nwhat would be a VAR estimated\nunder the assumption of stable\nand perfectly, normally\ndistributed markets.\n\nAs presented in the table\nbelow, Citi\u2019s average trading\nVAR increased $12 million from\n2022 to 2023, mainly due to\nincreased market volatility.\nCiti\u2019s average trading and\ncredit portfolio VAR decreased\n$6 million from 2022 to 2023.\n\nYear-end and Average Trading\nVAR and Trading and Credit\nPortfolio

In addition, product-specific back-testing on\nportfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing\nmodel performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi\u2019s\nU.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting (as described below) is performed against buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios\nacross the organization (trading desk level and total Citigroup)\nand the results are shared with U.S. banking regulators.\nMaterial VAR model and assumption changes must be independently\nvalidated within Citi\u2019s Independent Risk Management\norganization. All model changes, including those for the VAR\nmodel, are validated by the model validation group within Citi\u2019s\nModel Risk Management. In the event of significant model\nchanges, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to\nimplementation. In addition, significant model and assumption\nchanges are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by\nCiti\u2019s U.S. banking regulators. Citi uses the same independently\nvalidated VAR model for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management\nVAR (i.e., total trading and total trading and credit portfolios\nVARs) and, as such, the model review and validation process for\nboth purposes is as described above. Regulatory VAR, which is\ncalculated in accordance with Basel III, differs from Risk\nManagement VAR because certain positions included in Risk\nManagement VAR are not eligible\n\nfor market risk treatment in Regulatory VAR. The composition of\nRisk Management VAR is discussed under \u201cValue at Risk\u201d above.\nThe applicability of the VAR model for positions eligible for\nmarket risk treatment under U.S. regulatory capital rules is\nperiodically reviewed and approved by Citi\u2019s U.S. banking\nregulators. In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR\nincludes all trading book-covered positions and all foreign\nexchange and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III,\nRegulatory VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent\nand ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified\nas non-trading book and categories of exposures that are\nspecifically excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR\nexcludes CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi\u2019s own\nfair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from\nRegulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as\ncomputed under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-\nweighted assets. Regulatory VAR Back-Testing In accordance with\nBasel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR\nback-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a\n99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit\nand loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is\nheld constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following\nday). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-\nmarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in\ncovered positions from the close of the previous business day.\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue,\nnet interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions.\n                              113                               \nThe following graph presents\nthe daily buy-and-hold profit\nand loss associated with\nCiti\u2019s covered positions\ncompared to Citi\u2019s one-day\nRegulatory VAR during 2023.\nDuring 2023, three back-\ntesting exceptions were\nobserved at the Citigroup\nlevel.\n\nThe difference between the\n47.7% of days with buy-and-\nhold gains for Regulatory VAR\nback-testing and the 94.6% of\ndays with trading, net\ninterest and other revenue\nassociated with Citi\u2019s trading\nbusinesses, presented in the\nhistogram of daily trading-\nrelated revenue below,\nreflects, among other things,\nthat a significant portion of\nCiti\u2019s trading-related revenue\nis not generated from daily\nprice movements on these\npositions and exposures, as\nwell as differences in the\nportfolio composition of\nRegulatory VAR and Risk\nManagement VAR.\n                                                      \n  Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold  \n  Profit and Loss(1)(2)\u201412 Months Ended December 31,  \n  2023                                                \n  In millions of dollars                              \n                                                      \n(1) Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking\nregulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market\nrevenue movement attributable to the trading position from the\nclose of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss\nexcludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day\ntrading profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as\nchanges in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the\ntrading-related revenue presented in the chart of daily trading-\nrelated revenue above.\n\n(2) The loss values for mid-August and mid-December 2023 were\ndriven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso.\n                              114                               \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                \nCiti performs market risk\nstress testing on a regular\nbasis to estimate the impact\nof extreme market movements.\nIt is performed on individual\npositions and trading\nportfolios, as well as in\naggregate, inclusive of\nmultiple trading portfolios.\nCiti\u2019s market risk management,\nafter consultations with the\nbusinesses, develops both\nsystemic and specific stress\nscenarios, reviews the output\nof periodic stress testing\nexercises and uses the\ninformation to assess the\nongoing appropriateness of\nexposure levels and limits.\nCiti uses two complementary\napproaches to market risk\nstress testing across all\nmajor risk factors (i.e.,\nequity, foreign exchange,\ncommodity, interest rate and\ncredit spreads): top-down\nsystemic stresses and bottom-\nup business-specific stresses.\nSystemic stresses are designed\nto quantify the potential\nimpact of extreme market\nmovements on an institution-\nwide basis, and are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical periods of market\nstress and projections of\nadverse economic scenarios.\nBusiness-specific stresses are\ndesigned to probe the risks of\nparticular portfolios and\nmarket segments, especially\nthose risks that are not fully\ncaptured in VAR and systemic\nstresses.\n\nThe systemic stress scenarios\nand business-specific stress\nscenarios at Citi are used in\nseveral reports reviewed by\nsenior management and also to\ncalculate internal risk\ncapital for trading market\nrisk, as well as enable the\nmonitoring and managing of\nCiti\u2019s top market risks.\n\nIn general, changes in market\nvalues are defined over a one-\nyear horizon. For the most\nliquid positions and market\nfactors, changes in market\nvalues are defined over a\nshorter two-month horizon. The\nlimited set of positions and\nmarket factors whose market\nvalue changes are defined over\na two-month horizon are those\nthat in management\u2019s judgment\nhave historically remained\nvery liquid during financial\ncrises, even as the trading\nliquidity of most other\npositions and market factors\nmaterially declined.\n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISK                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nOperational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses or systems,\nincluding human error or\nmisjudgment, or from external\nevents. This includes legal\nrisk, which is the risk of\nloss (including litigation\ncosts, settlements and\nregulatory fines) resulting\nfrom the failure of Citi to\ncomply with laws, regulations,\nprudent ethical standards and\ncontractual obligations in any\naspect of its businesses, but\nexcludes strategic and\nreputation risks. Citi also\nrecognizes the impact of\noperational risk on the\nreputation risk associated\nwith Citi\u2019s business\nactivities.\n\nOperational risk is inherent\nin Citi\u2019s global business\nactivities, as well as related\nsupport functions, and can\nresult in losses. Citi\nmaintains a comprehensive\nCompany-wide risk taxonomy to\nclassify operational risks\nthat it faces using\nstandardized definitions\nacross Citi\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement Framework (see\ndiscussion below). This\ntaxonomy also supports\nregulatory requirements and\nexpectations inclusive of\nthose related to U.S. Basel\nIII, Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR),\nHeightened Standards for Large\nFinancial Institutions and\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST).\n\nCiti manages operational risk\nconsistent with the overall\nframework described in\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Overview\u201d above. Citi\u2019s\ngoal is to keep operational\nrisk at appropriate levels\nrelative to the\ncharacteristics of its\nbusinesses, the markets in\nwhich it operates, its capital\nand liquidity and the\ncompetitive, economic and\nregulatory environment. This\nincludes effectively managing\noperational risk and\nmaintaining or reducing\noperational risk exposures\nwithin Citi\u2019s operational risk\nappetite.\n\nCiti\u2019s Independent Operational\nRisk Management group has\nestablished a global\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework with policies and\npractices for identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\nmanaging and reporting\noperational risks and the\noverall operating\neffectiveness of the internal\ncontrol environment. As part\nof this framework, Citi has\ndefined its operational risk\nappetite and established a\nmanager\u2019s control assessment\n(MCA) process for self-\nidentification of significant\noperational risks, assessment\nof the performance of key\ncontrols and mitigation of\nresidual risk above acceptable\nlevels.\n\nEach Citi operating segment\nmust implement operational\nrisk processes consistent with\nthe requirements of this\nframework. This includes:\n\n\u2022 understanding the\noperational risks they are\nexposed to;\n\n\u2022 designing controls to\nmitigate identified risks;\n\n\u2022 establishing key indicators;\n\n\u2022 monitoring and reporting\nwhether the operational risk\nexposures are in or out of\ntheir operational risk\nappetite;\n\n\u2022 having processes in place to\nbring operational risk\nexposures within acceptable\nlevels;\n\n\u2022 periodically estimating and\naggregating the operational\nrisks they are exposed to; and\n\n\u2022 ensuring that sufficient\nresources are available to\nactively improve the\noperational risk environment\nand mitigate emerging risks.\n\nCiti considers operational\nrisks that result from the\nintroduction of new or changes\nto existing products, or\nresult from significant\nchanges in its organizational\nstructures, systems, processes\nand personnel.\n\nCiti has a governance\nstructure for the oversight of\noperational risk exposures\nthrough Business Risk and\nControls Committees (BRCCs),\nwhich are focused at the\ngroup, business or function,\nor geography level. BRCCs\nprovide channels to inform\nsenior management about\noperational risk exposures,\ncontrol issues and operational\nrisk events, and allow them to\ntake and document decisions\naround the mitigation,\nremediation or acceptance of\noperational risk exposures.\n\nIn addition, Independent Risk\nManagement, including the\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup, works proactively with\nCiti\u2019s businesses and\nfunctions to drive a strong\nand embedded operational risk\nmanagement culture and\nframework across Citi. The\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup actively challenges\nbusiness and functions\nimplementation of the\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework requirements and the\nquality of operational risk\nmanagement practices and\noutcomes.\n                              115                               \nInformation about businesses\u2019\nkey operational risks,\nhistorical operational risk\nlosses and the control\nenvironment is reported by\neach major business segment\nand functional area. Citi\u2019s\noperational risk profile and\nrelated information is\nsummarized and reported to\nsenior management, as well as\nto the Audit and Risk\nCommittees of Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors by the Head of\nOperational Risk Management.\n\nOperational risk is measured\nthrough Operational Risk\nCapital and Operational Risk\nRegulatory Capital for the\nAdvanced Approaches under\nBasel III. Projected\noperational risk losses under\nstress scenarios are estimated\nas a required part of the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR process.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s operational risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisks\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Cybersecurity Risk                                            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nCybersecurity risk is the\nbusiness risk associated with\nthe threat posed by a\ncyberattack, cyber breach or\nthe failure to protect Citi\u2019s\nmost vital business\ninformation assets or\noperations, resulting in a\nfinancial or reputational loss\n(see the operational processes\nand systems and cybersecurity\nrisk factors in \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). With an evolving\nthreat landscape, ever-\nincreasing sophistication of\nthreat actor tactics,\ntechniques and procedures,\nongoing and emerging\ngeopolitical conflicts, and\nthe use of new technologies,\nincluding those enabled by\nartificial intelligence and\nmachine learning capabilities,\nto conduct financial\ntransactions, Citi and its\nclients, customers and third\nparties (and fourth parties,\netc.) continue to be at risk\nfrom cyberattacks and\ninformation security\nincidents. Citi leverages a\nthreat-focused, defense-in-\ndepth strategy that ensures\nthat multiple controls work in\ntandem against various threats\nto increase the likelihood\nthat malicious activity will\nbe prevented, detected and\nmitigated.\n\nCiti has a mature\ncybersecurity threat\nidentification and management\nprogram that relies on an\nindustry-aligned defense-in-\ndepth approach, including an\ninternal cybersecurity\nintelligence center,\nparticipation in industry and\ngovernment information-sharing\nprograms, vulnerability\nassessment and scanning tools,\nintrusion detection and\nprevention systems, security\nincident and event management\nsystems, firewalls,\npenetration testing, adversary\nemulation exercises, data\nmanagement (including\nclassification, encryption at\nrest and in transit, and\naccess management), multi-\nfactor authentication\nrequirements and other\nlogical, physical and\ntechnical controls designed to\nprevent, deter, mitigate and\nrespond to cybersecurity\nthreats.\n\nCiti\u2019s cyber and information\nsecurity program is supported\nby comprehensive governance,\nincluding policies, standards\nand procedures that dictate\nrequirements and best\npractices around various\ntopics, including, but not\nlimited to, third-party risk\nmanagement, data management,\nasset management, information\nsecurity practices, security\nincident management, and\nregulatory and disclosure\ncompliance. Citi\u2019s Chief\nInformation Security Office\u2019s\nrisks and controls are\nmeasured against its\nCybersecurity Risk Appetite\nStatement, which was initially\napproved by the Risk\nManagement Committee of the\nBoard of Directors and is\nreapproved\n\nannually by Citi\u2019s Risk\nCommittee, chaired by Citi\u2019s\nChief Risk Officer. Citi\u2019s\nCybersecurity Risk Appetite\nStatement leverages key risk\nindicators to establish\nenterprise risk tolerance and\ndefine risk management\nstrategy with respect to cyber\nand information security.\nFurther, Citi actively\nparticipates in financial\nindustry, government and\ncross-sector knowledge-sharing\ngroups to enhance individual\nand collective cybersecurity\npreparedness and resilience.\n                                                                \n  Cybersecurity Risk Management and Governance                  \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s technology and\ncybersecurity risk management\nprogram is built on Citi\u2019s\nthree lines of defense, each\nof which is integrated into\nCiti\u2019s overall risk management\nsystems and processes.\n\nCiti\u2019s Chief Information\nSecurity Office, which is led\nby Citi\u2019s Chief Information\nSecurity Officer (CISO),\nserves as the first line of\ndefense.

Citi manages\ncybersecurity threats through\nits state-of-the-art fusion\ncenters, which serve as\ncentral commands for\nmonitoring and coordinating\nresponses to cyber threats.\n\nCiti\u2019s Chief Information\nSecurity Office is responsible\nfor application and\ninfrastructure defense and\nsecurity controls, performing\nvulnerability assessments and\nthird-party information\nsecurity assessments\n(including cybersecurity risk\nassessments associated with\nCiti\u2019s use of products and\nservices from vendors and\nother third-party providers),\nemployee awareness and\ntraining programs and security\nincident management. In each\ncase, the enterprise\ninformation security team\nworks in coordination with a\nnetwork of information\nsecurity officers who are\nembedded within Citi\u2019s global\nbusinesses and functions,\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\nphilosophy that all Citi\nstakeholders have a\nresponsibility in managing\ncyber and information security\nrisks.\n\nCiti\u2019s Technology and Cyber\nCompliance and Operational\nRisk Office (TCCORO) serves as\nthe second line of defense.\nThis office independently\nevaluates and challenges\nCiti\u2019s risk mitigation\npractices and capabilities,\nfrom a fused operational risk\nand compliance lens. It\nfunctions as a joint second\nline of defense and in\naccordance with Citi\u2019s\nCybersecurity Risk Appetite\nStatement. TCCORO also advises\nfirst line partners in CISO,\nsupporting enterprise-wide\nefforts to proactively\nidentify and remediate\ncybersecurity risks before\nthey materialize as incidents\nthat negatively affect\nbusiness operations.\n\nTo address evolving\ncybersecurity risks and\ncorresponding regulations,\nTCCORO monitors cybersecurity\nlegal and regulatory\nrequirements, identifies and\ndefines emerging risks,\nexecutes strategic\ncybersecurity threat\nassessments, performs new\nproduct and initiative\nreviews, performs data\nmanagement risk oversight and\nconducts cybersecurity risk\nassurance reviews (inclusive\nof third-party assessments).\nIn addition, this office\noversees and challenges\nmetrics related to\ncybersecurity and technology\nand ensures they remain\naligned with Citi\u2019s overall\noperational risk management\nframework to effectively\ntrack, identify and manage\nrisk. TCCORO presents an\nindependent viewpoint on\nenterprise cybersecurity risk\nposture, and oversees CISO\u2019s\n                              116                               \ncybersecurity risk\nidentification, measurement\nand enterprise-wide governance\nof cybersecurity risk.\n\nInternal Audit serves as\nCiti\u2019s third line of defense\nand provides independent\nassurance to the Audit\nCommittee of the Board on the\neffectiveness of controls\noperated by the first and\nsecond lines of defense to\nmanage cybersecurity risk.\n\nCiti recognizes the risks\nassociated with outsourcing\nservices to, sharing data\nwith, and/or technologically\ninteracting with third\nparties. Citi has built a\nrobust third-party information\nsecurity risk management\nprogram that governs third-\nparty engagements from\nselection, to the\nestablishment of legal\nagreements that govern the\nrelationship, to ongoing\nmonitoring through the\nduration of the relationship.\nThird-party risk management\nincludes contractual\nrequirements around data and\ncybersecurity, vulnerability\nassessments, third-party\ninformation security\nassessments performed at\nintervals determined by risk,\ngovernance to manage end-of-\nlife and end-of-vendor-support\nrisks, and third-party\nincident response protocols.\n                                                                \n  Management Governance                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Head of Operations and\nTechnology (O&T), who reports\ndirectly to Citi\u2019s CEO, has\noverall responsibility for\nCiti\u2019s first line of defense\ncyber and information security\nand technology programs.\nCiti\u2019s Head of O&T has over 40\nyears of experience in\nfinancial services and\ntechnology focused roles,\nincluding prior positions at\nCiti as a regional Chief\nInformation Officer, Head of\nTechnology for Citi\u2019s former\nInstitutional Clients Group\nand Head of Securities and\nBanking Operations and\nTechnology. For additional\ninformation, see \u201cCorporate\nInformation\u2014Executive\nOfficers\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s CISO, who reports\ndirectly to Citi\u2019s Head of\nO&T, has primary\nresponsibility to assess and\nmanage Citi\u2019s material risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats.\nCiti\u2019s CISO has decades of\nexperience in managing\ncybersecurity risks from prior\nroles as Deutsche Bank\u2019s Chief\nSecurity Officer, the Chief\nInformation Officer for the\nCentral Intelligence Agency\nand the Chief Information\nOfficer for the U.S.\nIntelligence Community. The\nCISO is supported by a team of\nsubject matter experts in\nsecurity operations, network\narchitecture, cyber and\ninformation security\ngovernance and cybersecurity\noperations. Citi\u2019s Chief\nInformation Security Office\nemploys approximately 3,400\nindividuals to manage its\noperations.\n\nCiti\u2019s Chief Technology\nOfficer (CTO), who also\nreports directly to Citi\u2019s\nHead of O&T, has primary\nresponsibility for technology\npolicy, innovation enablement\nand strategy. Citi\u2019s CTO has\ndecades of subject matter\nexperience in financial\nservices and technology from\npreviously leading the\nEngineering and Architecture\nServices group at J.P. Morgan\nChase, and serving as the\nChief Technology Officer at\nDeutsche Bank and the Chief\nInformation Officer for Sales,\nResearch and Securities Data\nServices at Goldman Sachs.\n\nMultiple management committees\nand functions also support\nCiti\u2019s cyber and information\nsecurity management.\n\nCiti\u2019s Information Security\nRisk Committee (ISRC) governs\nenterprise-level risk\ntolerance, including\ncybersecurity risk. This\ncommittee serves as the most\nsenior cyber and information\nsecurity forum within Citi and\nis supported by other\ncommittees/forums described\nbelow. The committee is\n\nco-chaired by Citi\u2019s Chief\nRisk Officer and Head of O&T\nand meets at least quarterly.\nIn addition, the committee\noversees risk tolerance\ndeterminations, reviews\nemerging threats and their\nbusiness impacts, commits to\nappropriate resource levels\nand investments and supports\nthe continual improvement of\nthe cyber and information\nsecurity management programs\nacross all of Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses and geographies.\n\nThe Chief Information Officer\nCommittee (CIOC), which\nconsists of, among others, the\nHead of O&T, Citi\u2019s Co-Chief\nInformation Officers (who\nreport to the Head of O&T),\nthe CISO, and the Head of\nTCCORO (who reports both to\nCiti\u2019s Head of Operational\nRisk within the Risk\nOrganization and its Head of\nGlobal Functions Compliance\nwithin the Global Legal and\nCompliance Organization),\nserves as an escalation forum\nfor items requiring the\nattention of technology senior\nmanagement, including approval\nof policies, and reports items\nrequiring further escalation\nto the Technology Committee of\nthe Board of Directors, as\nappropriate.\n\nThe Information Security Risk\nOperating Committee (ISROC) is\nchaired by the CISO and\ncomprises senior members of\nthe Chief Information Security\nOffice and representatives\nfrom partner organizations.\nThis committee sets the\ndirection and prioritization\nfor the implementation of the\ncyber and information security\nprogram across Citi. The\ncommittee reports and\nescalates to the CIOC,\nincluding for intermediary\nreview and approval of\npolicies escalated from the\nInformation Technology Policy\nCouncil (see below). Any\nactions constituting risk\nexceptions are escalated to\nthe ISRC.\n\nThe Security Architecture\nCouncil, which reports to the\nISROC, is an oversight and\ndecision-making body focused\non ensuring that the target\nlevel of security\narchitectural maturity is\nattained. This council is co-\nchaired by two representatives\nfrom the security architecture\nand cybersecurity services\norganizations.\n\nCiti\u2019s Information Technology\nPolicy Council provides a\ncentralized review to oversee\nconsistency in the formation\nof information technology\npolicies and standards. This\ncounsel maintains oversight of\npolicy document requirements\nto ensure that information\ntechnology policy documents\nmeet Citi\u2019s objectives as\nestablished internally and are\nin line with laws and\nregulations as identified and\ncommunicated by ICRM.\n\nIn addition, Citi regularly\nengages third parties globally\nto assess, audit and/or\nexercise Citi\u2019s cyber and\ninformation security program,\nwhich is ISO-27001 certified.\nISO-27001 is an international\nstandard for information\nsecurity management systems.\nCiti is regulated by bodies\nacross the globe that also\nregularly examine and audit\nCiti\u2019s cyber and information\nsecurity program against local\nlaws, regulations and industry\nbest practices.\n\nBoard Governance\n\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors and\nits committees provide\noversight of senior\nmanagement\u2019s efforts to\nmitigate cybersecurity risk\nand respond to cybersecurity\nincidents. Citi\u2019s Board\nincludes members with\ncybersecurity expertise and\nexperience.\n\nCiti\u2019s full Board is briefed\nannually on cybersecurity\nrisks and receives updates as\nneeded on Citi\u2019s cyber and\ninformation security program,\nincluding changes to the\nthreat landscape and a roadmap\nfor progress around addressing\n                              117                               \nrelated risks. Additionally,\nCiti\u2019s Board participates in\ncybersecurity exercises to\nimprove preparedness to\naddress cybersecurity\nincidents.\n\nThe Board\u2019s Technology\nCommittee receives quarterly\nupdates from the Chief\nInformation Security Office on\nthe cybersecurity threat\nlandscape, regulatory\nlandscape, posture, and\nstrategy and engages in\ndiscussions throughout the\nyear with senior management\nand subject matter experts on\nthe effectiveness of Citi\u2019s\noverall cybersecurity program.\n\nThe Board\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee (RMC) approved a\nstandalone Cybersecurity Risk\nAppetite Statement against\nwhich Citi\u2019s performance is\nmeasured quarterly. In\naddition, the RMC oversees\nCiti\u2019s risk profile, which\nincludes cybersecurity risk,\nand monitors whether Citi is\noperating within its\ncybersecurity risk appetite\nunder its mandate to review\nkey operational risks,\nincluding steps taken by\nmanagement to control such\nrisks.\n\nIn the event of a potentially\nmaterial cybersecurity\nincident impacting Citi, the\nBoard would be made aware of\nsuch incident via lines of\ncommunication that run from\nthe Chief Information Security\nOffice to senior management\nand also to the Board. This\ncontemporaneous reporting on\nsignificant cyber events\nincludes information and\ndiscussion around incident\nresponse, legal obligations\n(including disclosure), and\noutreach and notification to\nregulators and customers when\nneeded.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe Board\u2019s oversight of\ncybersecurity risk management,\nsee Citi\u2019s upcoming 2024\nAnnual Meeting Proxy Statement\nto be filed with the SEC in\nMarch 2024.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCompliance risk is the risk to\ncurrent or projected financial\ncondition and resilience\narising from violations of\nlaws, rules or regulations, or\nfrom non-conformance with\nprescribed practices, internal\npolicies and procedures or\nethical standards. Compliance\nrisk exposes Citi to fines,\ncivil money penalties, payment\nof damages and the voiding of\ncontracts. Compliance risk can\nresult in diminished\nreputation, harm to Citi\u2019s\ncustomers, limited business\nopportunities and lessened\nexpansion potential. It\nencompasses the risk of\nnoncompliance with all laws\nand regulations, as well as\nprudent ethical standards and\nsome contractual obligations.\nIt could also include exposure\nto litigation (known as legal\nrisk) from all aspects of\ntraditional and non-\ntraditional banking.\n\nCiti seeks to operate with\nintegrity, maintain strong\nethical standards and adhere\nto applicable policies and\nregulatory and legal\nrequirements. Citi must\nmaintain and execute a\nproactive Compliance Risk\nManagement (CRM) Framework (as\nset forth in the CRM Policy)\nthat is designed to manage\ncompliance risk effectively\nacross Citi, with a view to\nfundamentally strengthen the\ncompliance risk management\nculture across the lines of\ndefense taking into account\nCiti\u2019s risk governance\nframework and regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement\u2019s (ICRM) primary\nobjectives are to:\n\n\u2022 Drive and embed a culture of\ncompliance and control\nthroughout Citi;\n\n\u2022 Maintain and oversee an\nintegrated CRM Framework that\nfacilitates enterprise-wide\ncompliance with local,\nnational or cross-border laws,\nrules or regulations, Citi\u2019s\ninternal policies, standards\nand procedures and relevant\nstandards of conduct;\n\n\u2022 Assess compliance risks and\nissues across product lines,\nfunctions and geographies,\nsupported by globally\nconsistent systems and\ncompliance risk management\nprocesses; and\n\n\u2022 Provide compliance risk data\naggregation and reporting\ncapabilities.\n\nCiti carries out its\nobjectives and fulfills its\nresponsibilities through the\nCRM Framework, which is\ncomposed of the following\nintegrated key activities, to\nholistically manage compliance\nrisk:\n\n\u2022 Management of Citi\u2019s\ncompliance with laws, rules\nand regulations by identifying\nand analyzing changes,\nassessing the impact, and\nimplementing appropriate\npolicies, processes and\ncontrols;\n\n\u2022 Developing and providing\ncompliance training to ensure\ncolleagues are aware of and\nunderstand the key laws, rules\nand regulations;\n\n\u2022 Monitoring the Compliance\nRisk Appetite, which is\narticulated through\nqualitative compliance risk\nstatements describing Citi\u2019s\nappetite for certain types of\nrisk and quantitative measures\nto monitor the Company\u2019s\ncompliance risk exposure;\n\n\u2022 Executing Compliance Risk\nAssessments, the results of\nwhich inform Compliance Risk\nMonitoring and testing of\ncompliance risks and controls\nin assessing conformance with\nlaws, rules, regulations and\ninternal policies; and\n\n\u2022 Issue identification,\nescalation and remediation to\ndrive accountability,\nincluding measurement and\nreporting of compliance risk\nmetrics against established\nthresholds in support of the\nCRM Policy and Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nTo anticipate, control and\nmitigate compliance risk, Citi\nhas established the CRM Policy\nto achieve standardization and\ncentralization of\nmethodologies and processes,\nand to enable more consistent\nand comprehensive execution of\ncompliance risk management.\n\nCiti has a commitment, as well\nas an obligation, to identify,\nassess and mitigate compliance\nrisks associated with its\nbusinesses and functions. ICRM\nis responsible for oversight\nof Citi\u2019s CRM Policy, while\nall businesses and global\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for managing their\ncompliance risks and operating\nwithin the Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi is\nworking to address the FRB and\nOCC consent orders, which\ninclude improvements to Citi\u2019s\nCRM Framework and its\nenterprise-wide application\n(see \u201cCiti\u2019s Consent Order\nCompliance\u201d above).\n                              118                               \n                                                                \n  REPUTATION RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s reputation is a vital\nasset in building trust, and\nCiti is diligent in enhancing\nand protecting its reputation\nwith its key stakeholders. To\nsupport this, Citi has\ndeveloped a reputation risk\nframework. Under this\nframework, Citigroup and\nCitibank, N.A. have\nimplemented a risk appetite\nstatement and related key\nindicators to monitor\ncorporate activities and\noperations relative to Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite. The framework\nalso requires that business\nsegments escalate potential\nmaterial reputation risks that\nrequire review or mitigation\nthrough the applicable\nbusiness Management Forum or\nGroup Reputation Risk\nCommittee.\n\nThe Group Reputation Risk\nCommittee and Management\nForums, which are composed of\nCiti\u2019s senior executives,\ngovern the process by which\nmaterial reputation risks are\nidentified, measured,\nmonitored, controlled,\nescalated and reported. The\nGroup Reputation Risk\nCommittee and Management\nForums determine the\nappropriate actions to be\ntaken in line with risk\nappetite and regulatory\nexpectations, while promoting\na culture of risk awareness\nand high standards of\nintegrity and ethical behavior\nacross the Company, consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition. The Group\nReputation Risk Committee may\nescalate reputation risks to\nthe Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee or\nother appropriate committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n\nEvery Citi employee is\nresponsible for safeguarding\nCiti\u2019s reputation, guided by\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nColleagues are expected to\nexercise sound judgment and\ncommon sense in decisions and\nactions. They are also\nexpected to promptly escalate\nall issues that present\nmaterial reputation risk in\nline with policy.\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \nAs discussed above, strategic\nrisk is the risk of a\nsustained impact (not episodic\nimpact) to Citi\u2019s core\nstrategic objectives as\nmeasured by impacts on\nanticipated earnings, market\ncapitalization or capital,\narising from external factors\naffecting the Company\u2019s\noperating environment, as well\nas the risks associated with\ndefining and executing the\nstrategy, which are\nidentified, measured and\nmanaged as part of the\nStrategic Risk Framework at\nthe Enterprise Level.\n\nIn this context, external\nfactors affecting Citi\u2019s\noperating environment are the\neconomic conditions,\ngeopolitical/political\nlandscape,\nindustry/competitive\nlandscape, customer/client\nbehavior,\nregulatory/legislative\nenvironment and trends related\nto investors/shareholders.\nMaterial strategic risks that\nCiti is monitoring include the\nimpacts of an extended period\nof high inflation and interest\nrates, as well as\nmacroeconomic uncertainties\ndriven by low global growth\nand geopolitical issues\nincluding the Middle East\nconflict, the Russia\u2013Ukraine\nwar and U.S.\u2013China tensions.\nHeightened regulatory\nrequirements, specifically\nwith regard to capital as well\nas climate-related transition\nrisk, remain in focus. In\naddition to external factors\naffecting Citi\u2019s operating\nenvironment, Citi also\nmonitors risks related to the\nexecution of its strategy,\nwith heightened focus on\ndelivering the transformation\nof its risk and control\nenvironment pursuant to the\nFRB and OCC consent orders.\n\nCiti\u2019s Executive Management\nTeam is responsible for the\ndevelopment and execution of\nCiti\u2019s strategy. This strategy\nis translated into forward-\nlooking plans (collectively\nCiti\u2019s Strategic Plan) that\nare then cascaded across the\norganization. Citi\u2019s Strategic\nPlan is presented to the Board\non an annual basis, and is\naligned with risk appetite\nthresholds and includes a risk\nassessment as required by\ninternal frameworks. It is\nalso aligned with limit\nrequirements for capital\nallocation. Governance and\noversight of strategic risk is\nfacilitated by internal\ncommittees on a group-wide\nbasis.\n\nCiti works to ensure that\nstrategic risks are adequately\nconsidered and addressed\nacross its various risk\nmanagement activities, and\nthat strategic risks are\nassessed in the context of\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite. Citi\nconducts a top-down, bottom-up\nrisk identification process to\nidentify risks, including\nstrategic risks. Business\nsegments undertake a quarterly\nrisk identification process to\nsystematically identify and\ndocument all material risks\nfaced by Citi. Independent\nRisk Management oversees the\nrisk identification process\nthrough regular reviews and\ncoordinates identification and\nmonitoring of top risks. In\naddition, Citi performs a\nquarterly Risk Assessment of\nthe Plan (RAOP) and\ncontinuously monitors risks\nassociated with its execution\nof strategy. Independent Risk\nManagement also manages\nstrategic risk by monitoring\nrisk appetite thresholds in\nconjunction with its Global\nStrategic Risk Committee,\nwhich is part of the\ngovernance structure that Citi\nhas in place to manage its\nstrategic risks.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s strategic risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nabove.\n                                                                \n  Climate Risk                                                  \n                                                                \nClimate change presents\nimmediate and long-term risks\nto Citi and its clients and\ncustomers, with the risks\nexpected to increase over\ntime. Climate risk refers to\nthe risk of loss arising from\nclimate change and comprises\nboth physical risk and\ntransition risk.\n\nClimate risk is an overarching\nrisk that can act as a driver\nof other categories of risk,\nsuch as credit risk from\nobligors exposed to high\nclimate risk, strategic risks\nif Citi fails to consider\ntransition risk in client\nselection, reputational risk\nfrom increased stakeholder\nconcerns about financing or\nfailing to finance high-carbon\nindustries and operational\nrisk from physical risks to\nCiti\u2019s facilities. Citi\u2019s\nfocus on climate risk\ncontinues to advance, driven\nby materiality of strategic,\nreputation and financial risk\nconsiderations. Citi continues\nto make progress toward\nembedding these considerations\ninto its overarching risk\nmanagement approach. For\nadditional information on\nclimate risk, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nabove.\n\nCiti continues to develop\nglobally consistent principles\nand approaches for managing\nclimate risk across the\nCompany through the\nimplementation of its Climate\nRisk Management Framework\n(Climate RMF). The Climate RMF\nprovides information on the\ngovernance, roles and\nresponsibilities, and\nprinciples to support the\nidentification, measurement,\nmonitoring, controlling and\nreporting of climate risks.\nThrough this implementation,\nclimate risk is being embedded\ninto relevant policies and\nprocesses over time.\n                              119                               \nCiti continues to enhance its\nmethodologies for quantifying\nhow climate risks could impact\nthe individual credit profiles\nof its clients across various\nsectors. Citi has developed\nand embedded sector-specific\nclimate risk assessments in\nits credit underwriting\nprocess for certain sectors\nthat Citi has identified as\nhigher climate risk. Such\nclimate risk assessments are\ndesigned to incorporate\npublicly available client\ndisclosures and data from\nthird-party providers and\nfacilitate conversations with\nclients on their most material\nclimate risks and management\nplans for adaptation and\nmitigation. This helps Citi\nbetter understand its clients\u2019\nbusinesses and climate-related\nrisks and support their\nfinancial needs. Citi\u2019s Net\nZero plan implementation is\nleading to the further\nintegration of climate risk\ndiscussions into client\nengagement and client\nselection.\n\nCiti also reviews factors\nrelated to climate risk under\nits Environmental and Social\nRisk Management (ESRM) Policy,\nwhich includes a focus on\nclimate risk related to\nfinanced projects and clients\nin certain sectors.\nConsidering the credit risk of\nstranded assets, as well as\nthe reputational risks, Citi\u2019s\nESRM Policy describes sector\napproaches to certain high-\ncarbon sectors, including\nthermal coal mining and power.\n\nFurthermore, Citi continues to\nparticipate in financial\nindustry initiatives and\ndevelop and pilot\nmethodologies and approaches\nfor measuring and assessing\nthe potential financial risks\nof climate change, including\nscenario analysis. Citi also\ncontinues to monitor\nregulatory developments on\nclimate risk and sustainable\nfinance and actively engage\nwith regulators on these\ntopics.\n\nFor additional information\nabout sustainability and other\nESG matters at Citi, see\n\u201cClimate Change and Net Zero\u201d\nabove.\n                                                                \n  OTHER RISKS                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  LIBOR Transition Risk                                         \n                                                                \nAs previously disclosed, the\nUSD LIBOR bank panel ended on\nJune 30, 2023.

The increase in\nexposure was driven by a $0.4\nbillion appreciation of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar\n(USD) as well as dividend\ninflows during the quarter,\nreceived from Russian\ncorporations on behalf of\nCiti\u2019s clients. The dividend\ninflows were partially offset\nby deposit outflows and tax\npayments to local authorities.\nApproximately 71% of Citi\u2019s\nremaining exposures in Russia\nare corporate dividends that\nCiti cannot remit to its\nclients due to restrictions\nimposed by the Russian\ngovernment, of which $3.9\nbillion is held with the\nDeposit Insurance Agency as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $0.2\nbillion as of December 31,\n2023 (down from $1.0 billion\nas of September 30, 2023). The\ndecline was due to a reserve\nbuild related to increases in\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures in Russia driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law (see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below).\n\nCiti hedges its ruble/USD spot\nFX exposure in AOCI through\nthe purchase of FX\nderivatives. The ongoing mark-\nto-market of the hedging\nderivatives is also reported\nin AOCI . When the ruble\ndepreciates against the USD,\nthe USD equivalent value of\nCitigroup\u2019s investment in AO\nCitibank also declines. This\nchange in value is offset by\nthe change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative). Going forward,\nCiti may record devaluations\non its net ruble-denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nthe benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposures.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nServices , Markets , Banking ,\nUSPB and All Other results\nhave been impacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\nand its direct and indirect\nimpact on the European and\nglobal economies. For a\nbroader discussion of these\nfactors and volatilities on\nCiti\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$0.1 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct\nRussian counterparties\n(unchanged from September 30,\n2023). This balance does not\ninclude the additional\nreserves to transfer risk for\nexposures in Russia.\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbanking businesses, including\nactively pursuing portfolio\nsales. In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi has incurred\napproximately $63 million to-\ndate in charges, largely from\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges. Citi expects\nto incur an additional\napproximate $58 million in\nestimated charges\n(approximately $2 million in\nServices , Markets and Banking\nand $56 million in All Other ,\nexcluding the impact from any\nportfolio sales). This\nestimate was revised down\nduring the fourth quarter of\n2023 from $85 million at\nSeptember 30, 2023. For\nadditional information about\nCiti\u2019s continued efforts to\nreduce its operations and\nexposure in Russia, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above and Note 2.\n                                                                \n  Deconsolidation Risk                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s remaining operations in\nRussia subject it to various\nrisks, including, among\nothers, foreign currency\nvolatility, including\nappreciation or devaluation;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory Russian laws and\nregulations on the conduct of\nits business; sanctions or\nasset freezes; or other\ndeconsolidation events (see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d\nabove). Examples of triggers\nthat may result in\ndeconsolidation of AO Citibank\ninclude voluntary or forced\nsale of ownership or loss of\ncontrol due to actions of\nrelevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, Citi\ncontinued to consolidate AO\nCitibank because none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank, Citi\u2019s foreign\nentity in Russia, Citi would\nbe required to (i) write off\nthe net investment of\napproximately $0.2 billion\n(compared to $1.0 billion as\nof September 30, 2023), (ii)\nrecognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\n(unchanged from September 30,\n2023) through earnings, and\n(iii) recognize a loss of $0.6\nbillion (unchanged from\nSeptember 30, 2023) on\nintercompany liabilities owed\nby AO Citibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients               \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or\n                              123                               \nblock the funds until\napplicable sanctions are\nlifted or the payment is\notherwise authorized under\napplicable law.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its remaining\npresence in Russia and\nassociation with Russian\nindividuals or entities,\nwhether subject to sanctions\nor not, including Citi\u2019s\ninability to support its\nglobal clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations. For\nadditional information on\noperational and cyber risks,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisks\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Board\u2019s Role in Overseeing Related Risks                      \n                                                                \nThe Citi Board of Directors\n(Board) and the Board\u2019s Risk\nManagement Committee (RMC) and\nits other Committees have\nreceived and continue to\nreceive regular reports from\nsenior management regarding\nthe war in Ukraine and its\nimpact on Citi\u2019s operations in\nRussia, Ukraine and elsewhere,\nas well as the war\u2019s broader\ngeopolitical, macroeconomic\nand reputational impacts.

In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 230\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, Citi had\n$1.5 billion of direct\nexposures related to Ukraine,\nunchanged from September 30,\n2023.\n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.0 billion (compared to $1.9\nbillion at September 30,\n2023). Citi uses the U.S.\ndollar (USD) as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\ncountries such as Argentina\nthat are deemed highly\ninflationary in accordance\nwith GAAP. Citi therefore\nrecords the impact of exchange\nrate fluctuations on its net\nArgentine peso\n(ARS)\u2013denominated assets\ndirectly in earnings. Citi\nuses Argentina\u2019s official\nmarket exchange rate to\nremeasure its net ARS-\ndenominated assets into USD.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the\nofficial ARS exchange rate was\n808.48, which devalued by 57%\nagainst the USD during the\nfourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe decline in Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Argentina during\nthe fourth quarter of 2023 was\nprimarily a result of\napproximately $880 million in\ntranslation losses in revenues\ndue to devaluation of the ARS\n(approximately $1.9 billion in\n\naggregate translation losses\nin revenues for full-year\n2023,\n\ncompared to approximately $820\nmillion for full-year 2022).\nThe decline in the net\ninvestment was also due to\nreserve builds in the quarter\nrelated to increases in\ntransfer risk associated with\nexposures in Argentina driven\nby safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law. These reductions\nin the net investment were\npartially offset by aggregate\nother net income, consisting\nof net interest income in\nArgentina, and interest earned\non the net investment, of\nwhich a significant portion is\ninvested at high local\novernight rates in Argentina.\n\nThe Central Bank of Argentina\nhas continued to maintain\ncertain capital and currency\ncontrols that generally\nrestrict Citi\u2019s ability to\naccess USD in Argentina and\nremit earnings from its\nArgentine operations. Citi\u2019s\nnet investment in Argentina\nwill therefore continue to be\nexposed to additional foreign\ncurrency translation losses to\nthe extent it is denominated\nin ARS and is unable to be\nremitted or exchanged.\nFurthermore, the capital and\ncurrency controls have\nresulted in indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms that\n                              124                               \nsome Argentine entities may\nuse to obtain USD, generally\nat rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nunder U.S. GAAP, these\nexchange mechanisms cannot be\nused to re-measure Citi\u2019s net\nmonetary assets into USD. If\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate further converges with\nthe approximate rate implied\nby the indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms, Citi\ncould incur additional\ntranslation losses on its net\ninvestment in Argentina.\nAccordingly, Citi seeks to\nreduce its overall ARS\nexposure in Argentina while\ncomplying with local capital\nand currency exposure\nlimitations.\n\nOf the $1.0 billion net\ninvestment in Argentina as of\nDecember 31, 2023, Citi\u2019s net\nARS exposure was approximately\n$0.4 billion. The net ARS\nexposure is reduced as a\nresult of Citi holding\napproximately $100 million of\nUSD-denominated loans as well\nas approximately $500 million\nof certain local government\nbonds that are indexed to the\nhigher of the USD exchange\nrate or the local inflation\nindex. If Citi had not\ninvested in such instruments\nto reduce its ARS exposure,\nCiti would have recognized\nadditional translation losses\nduring the fourth quarter of\n2023. Given current economic\nconditions and the local\ncapital, currency and\nregulatory limitations, Citi\ncannot guarantee the\navailability or effectiveness\nof such mechanisms to reduce\nits ARS exposure in the\nfuture.\n\nIn addition to reducing the\nARS exposure, Citi also seeks\nto economically hedge the\nexposure to the extent\npossible and prudent using\nnon-deliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of December\n31, 2023, the international\nNDF market had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\u2019s\ninability to economically\nhedge its remaining net ARS\nexposure. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute NDF contracts for this\nunhedged exposure in the\nfuture, Citi would record\ndevaluations on its net ARS-\ndenominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure. Citi cannot predict\nthe availability of hedging\ninstruments in the future nor\ncan it predict changes in\nforeign exchange rates and the\nresulting impact on earnings.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished an appropriate ACL\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of December\n31, 2023.

As an example, because\ntotal outstandings under FFIEC\nguidelines do not include the\nbenefit of margin or hedges,\nmarket volatility in interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates\nand credit spreads may cause\nsignificant fluctuations in\nthe level of total\noutstandings, all else being\nequal.\n                              125                               \nThe tables below present each country whose total outstandings\nexceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) Non-bank financial institutions.\n\n(2) Included in total outstanding.\n\n(3) Total outstanding includes cross-border claims on third\nparties, as well as local country assets.

Note 1 contains a\nsummary of all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. These policies, as\nwell as estimates made by\nmanagement, are integral to\nthe presentation of Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition. While all\nof these policies require a\ncertain level of management\njudgment and estimates, this\nsection highlights and\ndiscusses the significant\naccounting policies that\nrequire management to make\nhighly difficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A portion of\nthese assets and liabilities\nis reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet as Trading account\nassets , Available-for-sale\nsecurities and Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\ndrivers to the valuation of an\ninstrument and the degree of\nilliquidity and subsequent\nlack of observability in\ncertain markets. The fair\nvalue of these instruments is\nreported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nwith the changes in fair value\nrecognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses, and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 1, 6, 26 and 27.\n                              127                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below presents\nCiti\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\ntotal ACL as of the fourth\nquarter of 2023.

In\naddition, Citi\u2019s reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables are reflected in\nOther assets . These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\n\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover a R&S timeframe. The R&S\nforecast period for consumer\nand corporate loans is eight\nquarters.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects risks and\ncertain economic conditions\nnot fully captured in the\nquantitative component. Both\nthe quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                              128                               \nQuantitative Component Citi\nestimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions. For its consumer\nand corporate portfolios,\nCiti\u2019s expected credit losses\nare determined primarily by\nutilizing models that consider\nthe borrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables, including housing\nprices, unemployment rate and\nreal GDP, and cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry,\nproduct and business segments.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well\nas other credit trends.\nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes\nrisks that are not fully\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent. These may include\nbut are not limited to\nportfolio characteristics,\nidiosyncratic events, factors\nnot within historical loss\ndata or the economic forecast,\nuncertainty in the credit\nenvironment and other factors\nas required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The primary examples of\nthese are the following: \u2022\nTransfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S. for\ncertain safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law \u2022 Potential\nimpacts on vulnerable\nindustries and regions due to\nemerging macroeconomic risks\nand uncertainties, including\nthose related to potential\nglobal recession, inflation,\ninterest rates, commodity\nprices and geopolitical\ntensions \u2022 Normalization of\nportfolio performance and\nconsumer behavior from low\nlosses as a result of\ngovernment stimulus and market\nliquidity during the COVID-19\npandemic As of the fourth\nquarter of 2023, Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the\nACL increased quarter-over-\nquarter. The increase was\nprimarily driven by increases\nin transfer risk associated\nwith exposures outside the\nU.S. for safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law, and more\nspecifically, with cross-\nborder and cross-currency\nexposures in Argentina, based\non prevailing economic trends,\ncurrency devaluation and\ngeopolitical risk that may\nimpact Argentina\u2019s ability to\nsustain external debt service,\nand in Russia for the\nprolonged political and\neconomic instability. These\nincreases were partially\noffset by releases of\nCOVID-19\u2013related uncertainty\nreserves, as the portfolio\ndelinquencies and losses\ncontinue to increase, reaching\npre-pandemic losses and as\nrisks are captured in the\nquantitative component of the\nACL.\n\nMacroeconomic Variables As\nfurther discussed below, Citi\nconsiders a multitude of\nglobal macroeconomic variables\nfor the base, upside and\ndownside probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe quantitative component of\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL.

Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 4Q23, U.S. real GDP growth\nis expected to decline during\n2024, while the unemployment\nrate is expected to increase\nmodestly over the eight-\nquarter forecast horizon,\nbroadly returning to pre-\npandemic levels. Scenario\nWeighting Citi\u2019s ACL is\nestimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario. For example,\ncompared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nreflects a recession,\nincluding an elevated average\nU.S. unemployment rate of 6.8%\nover the eight-quarter R&S\nperiod, with a peak difference\nof 3.2% in the second quarter\nof 2025. The downside scenario\nalso reflects a year-over-year\n                              129                               \nU.S. real GDP contraction in\n2024 of 1.9%, with a peak\nquarter-over-quarter\ndifference to the base\nscenario of 1.2% in the first\nquarter of 2024.\n\nCiti\u2019s ACL is sensitive to the\nvarious macroeconomic\nscenarios that drive the\nquantitative component of\nexpected credit losses, due to\nchanges in the length and\nseverity of forecasted\neconomic variables or events\nin the respective scenarios.\nTo demonstrate this\nsensitivity, Citi applied 100%\nweight to the downside\nscenario as of December 31,\n2023 to reflect the most\nsevere economic deterioration\nforecast in the multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe weighted scenario\nassumptions; therefore,\napplying a 100% downside\nscenario weight would result\nin a hypothetical increase in\nthe ACL of approximately $5.2\nbillion related to lending\nexposures, except for loans\nindividually evaluated for\ncredit losses and other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost.\n\nThis analysis does not\nincorporate any impacts or\nchanges to the qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL. These\nfactors could change the\noutcome of the sensitivity\nanalysis based on historical\nexperience and current\nconditions at the time of the\nassessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of December 31,\n2023.\n\n4Q23 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for\nthe fourth quarter of 2023 was\n$21.8 billion, compared to\n$20.2 billion as of September\n30, 2023. The net build of\n$1.5 billion is primarily\nrelated to (i) an approximate\n$1.3 billion build for\nincreases in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures in\nArgentina and Russia (see \u201cACL\non Other Financial Assets\u201d\nbelow), and (ii) an\napproximate $0.5 billion build\nfor growth in card balances in\nUSPB . Citi believes its\nanalysis of the ACL reflects\nthe forward view of the\neconomic environment as of\nDecember 31, 2023. See Note 16\nfor additional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. cards\n(Branded Cards and Retail\nServices) in USPB . Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACLL build was\n$0.5 billion in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, primarily\ndriven by growth in U.S. cards\nbalances, resulting in a\nDecember 31, 2023 ACLL balance\nof $15.4 billion, or 3.97% of\ntotal funded consumer loans.\n\nFor U.S. cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans decreased to\n7.67% as of December 31, 2023,\ndue to seasonal improvement,\ncompared to 7.81% at September\n30, 2023. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to total\nfunded loans was 1.25% at\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to\n1.24% at September 30, 2023.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nbuild of less than $0.1\nbillion in the fourth quarter\nof 2023. The build was\nprimarily driven by loan\ngrowth and was mainly offset\nby releases related to\nreserves for specific risks\nand uncertainties impacting\n\nvulnerable industries and\nregions. The ACLL reserve\nbalance remained at $2.7\nbillion, or 0.93% of total\nfunded corporate loans as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC release of\n$0.1 billion in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, which\ndecreased the ACLUC reserve\nbalance, included in Other\nliabilities , to $1.7 billion.\nThe release was primarily\ndriven by releases related to\nreserves for specific risks\nand uncertainties impacting\nvulnerable industries and\nregions.\n                                                                \n  ACL on Other Financial Assets                                 \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost for the\nfourth quarter of 2023 was\n$1.9 billion, compared to $0.8\nbillion as of September 30,\n2023. The net build of $1.1\nbillion was primarily related\nto increases in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S., driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law, and more\nspecifically, to cross-border\nand cross-currency exposures\nin Argentina, based on\nprevailing economic trends,\ncurrency devaluation and\ngeopolitical risk that may\nimpact Argentina\u2019s ability to\nsustain external debt service,\nand in Russia for the\nprolonged political and\neconomic instability.

These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsustained decrease in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023,\nCitigroup\u2019s activities were\nconducted through the\nreportable operating segments:\nServices , Markets , Banking ,\nUSPB and Wealth , with the\nremaining operations recorded\nin All Other , which includes\nactivities not assigned to a\nspecific operating segment as\nwell as discontinued\noperations. Goodwill\nimpairment testing is\nperformed at the level below\nthe operating segment\n(referred to as a reporting\nunit).\n                              130                               \nCiti performed its annual\ngoodwill impairment test as of\nOctober 1, 2023, which\nresulted in no impairment of\nany of Citi\u2019s reporting units\u2019\ngoodwill.\n\nCiti utilizes allocated\ntangible common equity as a\nproxy for the carrying value\nof its reporting units for\npurposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. The\nallocated equity in the\nreporting units is determined\nbased on the capital the\nbusiness would require if it\nwere operating as a standalone\nentity, incorporating\nsufficient capital to be in\ncompliance with both current\nand expected regulatory\ncapital requirements,\nincluding capital for\nspecifically identified\ngoodwill and intangible\nassets. The capital allocated\nto the reporting units is\nincorporated into the annual\nbudget process, which is\napproved by Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors.\n\nGoodwill impairment testing\ninvolves management judgment,\nrequiring an assessment of\nwhether the carrying value of\na reporting unit can be\nsupported by its fair value\nusing widely accepted\nvaluation techniques, such as\nthe market approach (earnings\nmultiples and/or transaction\nmultiples) and/or the income\napproach (discounted cash flow\n(DCF) method). In applying\nthese methodologies, Citi\nutilizes a number of factors,\nincluding actual operating\nresults, future business\nplans, economic projections\nand market data.\n\nSimilar to 2022, Citi engaged\nan independent valuation\nspecialist in 2023 to assist\nin Citi\u2019s valuation of all the\nreporting units, primarily\nemploying both the income and\nmarket approach to determine\nthe fair value of the\nreporting units. The income\napproach utilized discount\nrates that Citi believes\nadequately reflected the risk\nand uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in the\ninternally generated cash flow\nprojections. The market\napproach utilizes observable\nmarket data from comparable\npublicly traded companies,\nsuch as price-to-earnings or\nprice-to-tangible book value\nratios, to estimate a\nreporting unit\u2019s fair value.\nManagement uses judgment in\nthe selection of comparable\ncompanies and includes those\nwith the most similar business\nactivities.\n\nThe income approach employs a\ncapital asset pricing model in\nestimating the discount rate.\nSince none of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units are publicly\ntraded, individual reporting\nunit fair value determinations\ncannot be directly correlated\nto Citigroup\u2019s common stock\nprice. The sum of the fair\nvalues of the reporting units\nexceeded the overall market\ncapitalization of Citi as of\nOctober 1, 2023. However, Citi\nbelieves that it is not\nmeaningful to reconcile the\nsum of the fair values of the\nCompany\u2019s reporting units to\nits market capitalization due\nto several factors. The market\ncapitalization of Citigroup\nreflects the execution risk in\na transaction involving\nCitigroup due to its size.\nHowever, the individual\nreporting units\u2019 fair values\nare not subject to the same\nlevel of execution risk or a\nbusiness model that is as\nglobal. In addition, the\nmarket capitalization of\nCitigroup does not include\nconsideration of the\nindividual reporting unit\u2019s\ncontrol premium.\n\nAs discussed in Note 3,\neffective in the fourth\nquarter of 2023, as part of\nits organizational\nsimplification, Citi made\nchanges to its management\nstructure, which resulted in\nchanges in its operating\nsegments and reporting units\nto reflect how the CEO, who is\nthe chief operating decision\nmaker, manages the Company,\nincluding allocating resources\nand measuring performance.\n\nThe reorganization of Citi\u2019s\nsegment structure, including\nthe change of management, and\nthe business realignment\nbetween Banking and Markets\nwere identified as triggering\nevents for purposes of\ngoodwill impairment testing.\nConsistent with the\nrequirements of ASC 350,\nadditional interim goodwill\nimpairment tests were\nperformed as of December 13,\n2023, which resulted in no\nimpairment during the fourth\nquarter. Additionally,\ngoodwill was reallocated from\nBanking to Markets related to\nthe business realignment based\non their relative fair values\nusing the valuation performed\nas of the effective date of\nthe reorganization. No\nadditional triggering events\nwere identified and no\ngoodwill was impaired during\n2023.\n\nBased on the fourth-quarter\nassessments, the results of\nthe impairment tests showed\nthat the fair values of Citi\u2019s\nreporting units exceeded their\ncarrying values for all\nreporting units. The\nimpairment tests results also\nshowed that the fair value of\nthe Mexico Consumer/SBMM\nreporting unit as a percentage\nof its carrying value was\n106%, with the carrying value\nincluding approximately $1.1\nbillion of goodwill. For each\nof the remaining reporting\nunits, fair value exceeded\ncarrying value by at least\n10%.\n\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as Citi\u2019s management\nimplements its organizational\nsimplification. If\nmanagement\u2019s future estimates\nof key economic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture. See Notes 1 and 17 for\nadditional information on\ngoodwill, including the\nchanges in the goodwill\nbalance year-over-year and the\nsegments\u2019 goodwill balances as\nof December 31, 2023.\n                                                                \n  Litigation Accruals                                           \n                                                                \nSee the discussion in Note 30\nfor Citi\u2019s policies on\nestablishing accruals for\nlitigation and regulatory\ncontingencies.\n                                                                \n  Income Taxes                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti is subject to the income\ntax laws of the U.S., its\nstates and local\nmunicipalities and the\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions in\nwhich Citi operates. These tax\nlaws are complex and are\nsubject to differing\ninterpretations by the\ntaxpayer and the relevant\ngovernmental taxing\nauthorities. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax\nlaws may be subject to review\nand adjudication by the court\nsystems of the various tax\njurisdictions or may be\nsettled with the taxing\nauthority upon audit.\n\nIn establishing a provision\nfor income tax expense, Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these\ninherently complex tax laws.\nCiti must also make estimates\nabout when in the future\ncertain items will affect\ntaxable income in the various\ntax jurisdictions, both\ndomestic and foreign. Deferred\ntaxes are recorded for the\nfuture consequences of events\nthat have been recognized in\nthe financial statements or\ntax returns, based on enacted\ntax laws and rates. Deferred\ntax assets (DTAs) are\nrecognized subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment that\nrealization is more-likely-\n                              131                               \nthan-not. For example, if it\nis more-likely-than-not that a\ncarry-forward would expire\nunused, Citi would set up a\nvaluation allowance against\nthat DTA. Citi has established\nvaluation allowances as\ndescribed below.\n\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act (Tax Reform),\nbeginning in 2018, Citi is\ntaxed on income generated by\nits U.S. operations at a\nfederal tax rate of 21%. The\neffect on Citi\u2019s state tax\nrate is dependent upon how and\nwhen the individual states\nthat have not yet addressed\nthe federal tax law changes\nchoose to adopt the various\nnew provisions of the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code.\n\nCiti\u2019s non-U.S. branches and\nsubsidiaries are subject to\ntax at their local tax rates.\nNon-U.S. branches also\ncontinue to be subject to U.S.\ntaxation. The impact of this\non Citi\u2019s earnings depends on\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate, and allocations of\noverall domestic loss (ODL)\nand expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to branch earnings.\nCiti expects no residual U.S.\ntax on such earnings. With\nrespect to non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries, dividends from\nthese subsidiaries will be\nexcluded from U.S. taxation.\nWhile the majority of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. subsidiary earnings\nare classified as global\nintangible low-taxed income\n(GILTI), Citi expects no\nmaterial residual U.S. tax on\nsuch earnings based on its\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 local\ntax rates, which exceed, on\naverage, the effective 13.125%\nGILTI tax rate. Finally, Citi\ndoes not expect the base\nerosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT)\nto affect its tax provision.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, final FTC\nregulations were published in\nthe Federal Register, which\neliminate the creditability of\nforeign taxes paid in certain\nsituations. These include\ncountries that do not align\nwith U.S. tax principles in\nsignificant part and for\nservices performed outside the\nrecipient country. In 2023,\nthe IRS announced that the\neffective date of these\nregulations was deferred until\nthe IRS gives notice\notherwise. The impact on\nCiti\u2019s effective tax rate is\nnot expected to be material.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act\nwas signed into law on August\n16, 2022. The Act includes a\nnew corporate alternative\nminimum tax (AMT) and a 1%\nexcise tax on stock buybacks,\nboth effective January 1,\n2023. The corporate AMT is a\n15% minimum tax on financial\nstatement income after\nadjusting for foreign taxes\npaid. Corporate AMT paid in\none year is creditable against\nregular corporate tax\nliability in future years.\nCiti does not expect to pay\nmaterial amounts of corporate\nAMT given its profitability\nand tax profile.\n\nThe 1% excise tax is a non-\ndeductible tax on the fair\nmarket value of stock\nrepurchased in the taxable\nyear, reduced by the fair\nmarket value of any stock\nissued in the same year. See\nNote 11 for the 2023 impact on\nearnings per share related to\nthe excise tax.\n                                                                \n  Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances (VA)             \n                                                                \nAt December 31, 2023, Citi had\nnet DTAs of $29.6 billion. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2023,\nCiti\u2019s DTAs increased by $1.3\nbillion, primarily as a result\nof the geographic mix of\nearnings. On a full-year\nbasis, Citi\u2019s DTAs increased\nby $1.9 billion from $27.7\nbillion at December 31, 2022.\n\nOf Citi\u2019s total net DTAs of\n$29.6 billion as of December\n31, 2023, $12.8 billion,\nprimarily related to tax\ncarry-forwards, was deducted\nin calculating Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital.\n\nNet DTAs arising from\ntemporary differences are\ndeducted from regulatory\ncapital if in excess of the\n10%/15% limitations (see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d above).\nFor the quarter and year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, Citi had\n$2.3 billion of disallowed\ntemporary difference DTAs\n(included in the $12.8 billion\nabove). The remaining $16.8\nbillion of net DTAs as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was not\ndeducted in calculating\nregulatory capital pursuant to\nBasel III standards and was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder those rules.\n\nCiti\u2019s total VA at December\n31, 2023 was $3.6 billion, an\nincrease of $1.2 billion from\n$2.4 billion at December 31,\n2022. The increase was\nprimarily driven by the\ngeneration of current-year\nFTCs in the branch basket.\nCiti\u2019s VA of $3.6 billion is\ncomposed of $1.9 billion on\nits FTC branch basket carry-\nforwards, $1.2 billion on its\nU.S. residual DTA related to\nits non-U.S. branches, $0.4\nbillion on local non-U.S. DTAs\nand $0.1 billion on state net\noperating loss carry-forwards.\n\nAs stated above with regard to\nthe impact of non-U.S.\nbranches on Citi\u2019s earnings,\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate, and the allocations of\nODL and expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to the branch basket\nare the main factors in\ndetermining the branch VA. The\nallocated ODL was affected by\nreduced taxable income\ngenerated in the current year.\n\nRecognized FTCs comprised\napproximately $1.2 billion of\nCiti\u2019s DTAs as of December 31,\n2023, compared to\napproximately $1.9 billion as\nof December 31, 2022. The\ndecrease in FTCs year-over-\nyear was primarily due to\ncurrent-year usage. The FTC\ncarry-forward period\nrepresents the most time-\nsensitive component of Citi\u2019s\nDTAs.\n\nCiti had an ODL of\napproximately $7 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, which\nallows Citi to elect a\npercentage between 50% and\n100% of future years\u2019 domestic\nsource income to be\nreclassified as foreign source\nincome. (See Note 10 for a\ndescription of the ODL.)\n\nThe majority of Citi\u2019s U.S.\nfederal net operating loss\ncarry-forward and all of its\nNew York State and City net\noperating loss carry-forwards\nare subject to a carry-forward\nperiod of 20 years. This\nprovides enough time to fully\nutilize the net DTAs\npertaining to these existing\nnet operating loss carry-\nforwards. This is due to\nCiti\u2019s forecast of sufficient\nU.S. taxable income and the\ncontinued taxation of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income by New York\nState and City.\n\nAlthough realization is not\nassured, Citi believes that\nthe realization of its\nrecognized net DTAs of $29.6\nbillion at December 31, 2023\nis more-likely-than-not, based\non management\u2019s expectations\nas to future taxable income in\nthe jurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\navailable tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC\nTopic 740, Income Taxes ).\nCiti has concluded that it has\nthe necessary positive\nevidence to support the\nrealization of its net DTAs\nafter taking its VAs into\nconsideration.\n\nSee Note 10 for additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s income\ntaxes, including its income\ntax provision, tax assets and\nliabilities and a tabular\nsummary of Citi\u2019s net DTAs\nbalance as of December 31,\n2023 (including the FTCs and\napplicable expiration dates of\nthe FTCs).

Based on\nthat evaluation, the CEO and\nCFO have concluded that at\nthat date Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective.\n                              133                               \nMANAGEMENT\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER\nFINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nCiti\u2019s management is\nresponsible for establishing\nand maintaining adequate\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting. Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting is\ndesigned to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the\nreliability of its financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal reporting purposes in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that\n(i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that in reasonable\ndetail accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of Citi\u2019s assets,\n(ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of\nfinancial statements in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles\nand that Citi\u2019s receipts and\nexpenditures are made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof Citi\u2019s management and\ndirectors, and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse or disposition of Citi\u2019s\nassets that could have a\nmaterial effect on its\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect all\nmisstatements.

Based on this\nassessment, management has\nconcluded that, as of December\n31, 2023, Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was effective. In\naddition, there were no\nchanges in Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting during the fiscal\nquarter ended December 31,\n2023 that materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n\nThe effectiveness of Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023 has been\naudited by KPMG LLP, Citi\u2019s\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in\ntheir report below, which\nexpressed an unqualified\nopinion on the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n                              134                               \n                                                                \n  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                    \n                                                                \nCertain statements in this\nreport, including but not\nlimited to statements included\nwithin the Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and\nResults of Operations, are\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995.

Such statements\nmay be identified by words\nsuch as believe, expect,\nanticipate, intend, estimate,\nmay increase, may fluctuate,\ntarget and illustrative, and\nsimilar expressions or future\nor conditional verbs such as\nwill, should, would and could.\n\nSuch statements are based on\nmanagement\u2019s current\nexpectations and are subject\nto risks, uncertainties and\nchanges in circumstances.\nActual results of operations\nand financial conditions,\nincluding capital and\nliquidity, may differ\nmaterially from those included\nin these statements due to a\nvariety of factors, including\nwithout limitation (i) the\nprecautionary statements\nincluded within the \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and each business\u2019s\ndiscussion and analysis of its\nresults of operations and (ii)\nthe factors listed and\ndescribed under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nabove.\n\nAny forward-looking statements\nmade by or on behalf of\nCitigroup speak only as to the\ndate they are made, and Citi\ndoes not undertake to update\nforward-looking statements to\nreflect the impact of\ncircumstances or events that\narise after the date that the\nforward-looking statements\nwere made.\n                              135                               \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT\nREGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING\nFIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board\nof Directors\n\nCitigroup Inc.:\n\nOpinions on the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the\naccompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of Citigroup\nInc. and subsidiaries (the\nCompany) as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe related consolidated\nstatements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes\nin stockholders\u2019 equity, and\ncash flows for each of the\nyears in the three-year period\nended December 31, 2023, and\nthe related notes\n(collectively, the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements). We also have\naudited the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nIn our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements referred to above\npresent fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the\nfinancial position of the\nCompany as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022,\nand the results of its\noperations and its cash flows\nfor each of the years in the\nthree-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, in\nconformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Also in our\nopinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2023 based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is\nresponsible for these\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, for maintaining\neffective internal control\nover financial reporting, and\nfor its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting, included in the\naccompanying management\u2019s\nannual report on internal\ncontrols over financial\nreporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on\nthe Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and an\nopinion on the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting based on\nour audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in\naccordance with the standards\nof the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free\nof material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud,\nand whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was maintained in\nall material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included\nperforming procedures to\nassess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as\nevaluating the overall\npresentation of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audit of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing\nthe risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other\nprocedures as we considered\nnecessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that\nour audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our\nopinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting is a\nprocess designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal purposes in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that,\nin reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit\npreparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of\nthe company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters\ncommunicated below are matters\narising from the current\nperiod audit of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements and (2) involved\nour especially\n                              136                               \nchallenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical\naudit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical\naudit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\n\nAssessment of the fair value\nof certain Level 3 assets and\nliabilities measured on a\nrecurring basis\n\nAs described in Notes 1, 26\nand 27 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis\nwere $896.8 billion, net and\n$347.6 billion, net,\nrespectively, at December 31,\n2023. The Company estimated\nthe fair value of Level 3\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured on a recurring basis\n($12.7 billion and $48.0\nbillion, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2023) utilizing\nvarious valuation techniques\nwith one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers being unobservable\nincluding, but not limited to,\ncomplex internal valuation\nmodels, alternative pricing\nprocedures or comparables\nanalysis and discounted cash\nflows. We identified the\nassessment of the measurement\nof fair value for certain\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as a critical\naudit matter. A high degree of\neffort, including specialized\nskills and knowledge, and\nsubjective and complex auditor\njudgment was involved in the\nassessment of the Level 3 fair\nvalues due to measurement\nuncertainty. Specifically, the\nassessment encompassed the\nevaluation of the fair value\nmethodology, including\nmethods, models and\nsignificant assumptions used\nto estimate fair value.\nSignificant assumptions\ninclude proxy data, forecast\ndata, the extrapolation and\ninterpolation of proxy data,\nforecast data, and historic\ndata as well as certain model\nassumptions. The assessment\nalso included an evaluation of\nthe conceptual soundness and\nperformance of the valuation\nmodels. The following are the\nprimary procedures we\nperformed to address this\ncritical audit matter. We\ninvolved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in evaluating the\ndesign and testing the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s Level\n3 fair value measurements\nincluding controls over:\n\n\u2022 valuation methodologies,\nincluding significant\nassumptions\n\n\u2022 independent price\nverification\n\n\u2022 evaluating that significant\nmodel assumptions reflected\nthose which a market\nparticipant would use to\ndetermine an exit price in the\ncurrent market environment\n\n\u2022 the valuation models used\nwere mathematically accurate\nand appropriate to value the\nfinancial instruments and\n\n\u2022 relevant information used\nwithin the Company\u2019s models\nthat was reasonably available\nwas considered in the fair\nvalue determination.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nmethodology for compliance\nwith U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. We\ninvolved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in developing an\nindependent fair value\nestimate for a selection of\ncertain Level 3 assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis\nbased on independently\ndeveloped valuation models and\nassumptions, as applicable,\nusing market data sources we\ndetermined to be relevant and\nreliable and compared our\nindependent expectation to the\nCompany\u2019s fair value\nmeasurements.\n\nAssessment of the allowance\nfor credit losses collectively\nevaluated for impairment\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 16\nto the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Company\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses\nwas $19.9 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023, which\nincludes the allowance related\nto loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments collectively\nevaluated for impairment (the\ncollective ACLL). The expected\ncredit losses for the\nquantitative component of the\ncollective ACLL is the product\nof multiplying the probability\nof default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD), and exposure at\ndefault (EAD) for consumer and\ncorporate loans. The credit\nloss factors applied are\ndetermined based on three\nmacroeconomic scenarios (base,\ndownside and upside)\nmultiplied by their respective\nscenario weights, which take\ninto consideration both\ninternal and external\nforecasted macroeconomic\nvariables over a reasonable\nand supportable period. After\nthe reasonable and supportable\nforecast period, the Company\nreverts over the reversion\nperiod to the long-term\naverage for the forecasted\neconomic variables and losses\nbased on historical\nobservations over multiple\neconomic cycles. The\nqualitative component\nconsiders idiosyncratic events\nand the uncertainty of\nforward-looking economic\nscenarios not captured in the\nquantitative models. For\nconsumer U.S. credit cards,\nthe Company utilizes the\npayment rate approach to\ndetermine the payments needed\nto pay off the end-of-period\nbalance. This approach\nincorporates payment rate\ncurves and is used to estimate\nEAD. Reserves for\nunconditionally cancelable\naccounts are based on the\nexpected life of the balance\nas of the evaluation date and\ndo not include undrawn\ncommitments that are\nunconditionally cancelable. In\naddition, the models used for\nconsumer U.S. credit card\nloans take into account\nleading credit indicators. For\ncorporate loans, the models\nconsider the credit quality as\nmeasured by risk ratings and\neconomic factors.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the collective ACLL,\nspecifically the quantitative\ncomponent for the consumer\nU.S. credit cards and\ncorporate portfolios, and the\nqualitative component for the\ncorporate portfolio as a\ncritical audit matter.\nAuditing the assessment\ninvolved significant\nmeasurement uncertainty\nrequiring complex auditor\njudgment, and specialized\nskills and knowledge as well\nas experience in the industry.\nOur assessment encompassed the\nevaluation of the various\ncomponents of the collective\nACLL methodology, including\nthe methods and models used to\nestimate the PD, LGD, and EAD\nand\n                              137                               \ncertain key assumptions and\ninputs for the Company\u2019s\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. The key\nassumptions and inputs for\nconsumer U.S. credit card\nloans encompass loan\ndelinquencies, certain credit\nindicators, such as FICO\nscores, and expected life as\nwell as the reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts for key\neconomic variables. The key\neconomic variables include\nU.S. unemployment (UER) and\nU.S. housing prices (HPI),\nwhich are utilized by the\nmodels. The key assumptions\nand inputs for corporate loans\nencompass risk ratings, credit\nconversion factor for unfunded\nlending commitments, and\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast for key economic\nvariables. The key economic\nvariables include U.S. real\ngross domestic product (GDP)\nand UER, which are utilized by\nthe model. The key assumptions\nand inputs for the qualitative\ncomponent for corporate loan\nportfolios include potential\nimpacts on vulnerable\nindustries and regions due to\nemerging macroeconomic risks\nand uncertainty including\nthose related to potential\nglobal recession, inflation,\ninterest rates, commodity\nprices, and geopolitical\ntensions. The assessment also\nincluded an evaluation of the\nconceptual soundness and\nperformance of the PD, LGD,\nand EAD models. In addition,\nauditor judgment was required\nto evaluate the sufficiency of\naudit evidence obtained.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s\nmeasurement of the collective\nACLL estimate, including\ncontrols over the:\n\n\u2022 approval of the collective\nACLL methodologies\n\n\u2022 determination of the key\nassumptions and inputs used to\nestimate the quantitative and\nqualitative components of the\ncollective ACLL\n\n\u2022 performance monitoring of\nthe PD, LGD, and EAD models.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nprocess to develop the\ncollective ACLL estimate by\ntesting certain sources of\ndata and assumptions that the\nCompany used and considered\nthe relevance and reliability\nof such data and assumptions.\nIn addition, we involved\ncredit risk professionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n\n\u2022 reviewing the Company\u2019s\ncollective ACLL methodologies\nand key assumptions for\ncompliance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n\n\u2022 assessing the conceptual\nsoundness and performance\ntesting of the PD, LGD, and\nEAD models by inspecting the\nmodel documentation to\ndetermine whether the models\nare suitable for their\nintended use\n\n\u2022 evaluating judgments made by\nthe Company relative to the\ndevelopment and performance\nmonitoring testing of the PD,\nLGD, and EAD models by\ncomparing them to relevant\nCompany-specific metrics\n\n\u2022 assessing the conceptual\nsoundness and performance\ntesting of the macroeconomic\nscenario weights model\n\nby inspecting the model\ndocumentation to determine\nwhether the model is suitable\nfor its intended use\n\n\u2022 assessing the economic\nforecast scenarios through\ncomparison to publicly\navailable forecasts\n\n\u2022 testing corporate loan risk\nratings for a selection of\nborrowers by evaluating the\nfinancial performance of the\nborrower, sources of\nrepayment, and any relevant\nguarantees or underlying\ncollateral\n\n\u2022 evaluating the methodologies\nused in determining the\nqualitative components and the\neffect of that component on\nthe collective ACLL compared\nwith relevant credit risk\nfactors and consistency with\ncredit trends.\n\nWe also assessed the\nsufficiency of the audit\nevidence obtained related to\nthe collective ACLL by\nevaluating the:\n\n\u2022 cumulative results of the\naudit procedures\n\n\u2022 qualitative aspects of the\nCompany\u2019s accounting practices\n\n\u2022 potential bias in the\naccounting estimates\n\nEvaluation of goodwill in the\nWealth, Markets and U.S.\nPersonal Banking (USPB)\nreporting units\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 17\nto the consolidated financial\nstatements, the goodwill\nbalance as of December 31,\n2023 was $20.1 billion, of\nwhich $4.5 billion related to\nWealth, $5.2 billion related\nto Markets and $5.4 billion\nrelated to USPB as of October\n1, 2023, prior to the Markets\nand Banking business\nrealignment.\n\nThe Company performs goodwill\nimpairment testing on an\nannual basis and whenever\nevents or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that\nthe carrying value of a\nreporting unit likely exceeds\nits fair value. This involves\nestimating the fair value of\nthe reporting units using both\ndiscounted cash flow analyses\nand a market multiples\napproach. The Company\nperformed its annual\nassessment on October 1, 2023.\nWe identified the evaluation\nof the goodwill impairment\nanalysis for Wealth, Markets,\nand USPB as of October 1, 2023\nas a critical audit matter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the\nCompany identified the\nreorganization described in\nNote 3 as a triggering event\ndue to a change in management\nfor Markets, Banking,\nServices, USPB, and Wealth and\nthe business realignment\nbetween Banking and Markets.\nThe Company performed\nadditional goodwill impairment\ntesting as of December 13,\n2023, the effective date of\nthe reorganization. The\nevaluation of goodwill\nimpairment testing as of\nDecember 13, 2023 was not\nidentified as a critical audit\nmatter.\n\nThe evaluation of the goodwill\nimpairment analysis for\nWealth, Markets, and USPB as\nof October 1, 2023 was\nidentified as a critical audit\nmatter because as of October\n1, 2023, the estimated fair\nvalue of the Wealth, Markets,\nand USPB reporting units\nmarginally exceeded their\ncarrying values at the\nconclusion of impairment\ntests. This indicated a higher\nrisk due to measurement\nuncertainty that the goodwill\nmay be impaired and,\ntherefore, involved a high\ndegree of subjective auditor\njudgment. Specifically, the\nassessment encompassed the\n                              138                               \nevaluation of the key\nassumptions used in estimating\nthe fair value of the Wealth,\nMarkets, and USPB reporting\nunits, which include the long-\nterm growth rate, discount\nrate, exit multiple\nassumptions, certain\nforecasted macroeconomic\nassumptions used to inform the\nforecasted income by reporting\nunit, and forecasted revenues\nand operating expenses by\nreporting unit used in the\ndiscounted cash flow analyses.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s\ndetermination of the estimated\nfair value of the Wealth,\nMarkets, and USPB units,\nincluding controls related to\nmanagement\u2019s process for\nassessing the appropriateness\nof:\n\n\u2022 certain assumptions\nincluding the long-term growth\nrate, discount rate, and exit\nmultiple assumptions used in\nthe discounted cash flow\nanalyses\n\n\u2022 certain forecasted\nmacroeconomic assumptions used\nto inform the forecasted\nincome by reporting unit\n\n\u2022 forecasted revenues and\noperating expenses by\nreporting unit.\n\nWe compared the Company\u2019s\nhistorical forecasts to actual\nresults at a consolidated\nlevel to assess the Company\u2019s\nability to accurately forecast\nkey metrics such as revenues\nand operating expenses. We\nalso compared prior year\nactuals to the expected trends\nfor revenues and operating\nexpenses at the reporting unit\nlevel to assess the Company\u2019s\nability to achieve their\nforecasts. We compared the\nCompany\u2019s fourth quarter 2023\nforecasts to actual fourth\nquarter 2023 results at the\nreporting unit level to assess\nthe Company\u2019s ability to\naccurately forecast. We\nevaluated the reasonableness\nof the Company\u2019s forecasts by\ncomparing to analyst reports.\n\nIn addition, we involved a\nvaluation professional with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n\n\u2022 developing an independent\nrange of long-term growth rate\nassumptions by reviewing\npublicly available data and\ncomparable industries and\ncomparing it to the Company\u2019s\nassumption\n\n\u2022 evaluating the discount rate\nby assessing the methodology\nused by management and\ndeveloping an independent\nassumption for the discount\nrate\n\n\u2022 developing an independent\nrange of the exit multiple\nassumptions using publicly\navailable data for comparable\nentities and comparing it to\nthe Company\u2019s assumption\nutilized in the discounted\ncash flow analysis\n\n\u2022 developing an independent\nestimate of the fair value of\nthe Wealth, Markets, and USPB\nreporting units using the\nincome and market multiple\napproaches and

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                 \n                                                                \nThroughout these Notes, \u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d\nrefer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nCertain reclassifications and updates have been made to the\nprior periods\u2019 financial statements and notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation. Principles of Consolidation The\nConsolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nCitigroup and its subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company\nconsolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or\nindirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where it\nexercises control. Entities in which the Company holds 20% to\n50% of the voting rights and/or has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence, other than investments of designated\nventure capital subsidiaries or investments accounted for at\nfair value under the fair value option, are accounted for under\nthe equity method, and the pro rata share of their income (loss)\nis included in Other revenue . Income from investments in less-\nthan-20%-owned companies is recognized when dividends are\nreceived. As discussed in more detail in Note 23, Citigroup also\nconsolidates entities deemed to be variable interest entities\nwhen Citigroup is determined to be the primary beneficiary.\nGains and losses on the disposition of branches, subsidiaries,\naffiliates, buildings and other investments are included in\nOther revenue . Citibank Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) is a\ncommercial bank and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of\nCitigroup. Citibank\u2019s principal offerings include investment\nbanking, commercial banking, cash management, trade finance and\ne-commerce; private banking products and services; consumer\nfinance, credit cards and mortgage lending; and retail banking\nproducts and services. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) An\nentity is a variable interest entity (VIE) if it meets either of\nthe criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\nTopic 810, Consolidation , which are (i) the entity has equity\nthat is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its\nactivities without additional subordinated financial support\nfrom other parties, or (ii) the entity has equity investors that\ncannot make significant decisions about the entity\u2019s operations\nor that do not absorb their proportionate share of the entity\u2019s\nexpected losses or expected returns. The Company consolidates a\nVIE when it has both the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and a\nright to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of\nthe entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE\n(that is, Citi is the primary beneficiary). In addition to\nvariable interests held in consolidated VIEs, the Company has\nvariable interests in other\n\nVIEs that are not consolidated because the Company is not the\nprimary beneficiary. All unconsolidated VIEs are monitored by\nthe Company to assess whether any events have occurred to cause\nits primary beneficiary status to change. All entities not\ndeemed to be VIEs with which the Company has involvement are\nevaluated for consolidation under other subtopics of ASC 810.See\nNote 23 for more detailed information. Foreign Currency\nTranslation Assets and liabilities of Citi\u2019s foreign operations\nare translated from their respective functional currencies into\nU.S. dollars using period-end spot foreign exchange rates. The\neffects of those translation adjustments are reported in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) , a\ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, net of any related hedge and\ntax effects, until realized upon sale or substantial liquidation\nof the foreign entity, at which point such amounts are\nreclassified into earnings. Revenues and expenses of Citi\u2019s\nforeign operations are translated monthly from their respective\nfunctional currencies into U.S. dollars at amounts that\napproximate weighted-average exchange rates. For transactions\nthat are denominated in a currency other than the functional\ncurrency, including transactions denominated in the local\ncurrencies of foreign operations that use the U.S. dollar as\ntheir functional currency, the effects of changes in exchange\nrates are primarily included in Principal transactions , along\nwith the related effects of any economic hedges. Instruments\nused to hedge foreign currency exposures include foreign\ncurrency forward, option and swap contracts and, in certain\ninstances, designated issues of non-U.S.-dollar debt. Foreign\noperations in countries with highly inflationary economies\ndesignate the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, with the\neffects of changes in exchange rates primarily included in Other\nrevenue . Investment Securities Investments include debt and\nequity securities. Debt securities include bonds, notes and\nredeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed and\nstructured securities that are subject to prepayment risk.\nEquity securities include common and nonredeemable preferred\nstock. Debt Securities \u2022 Debt securities classified as \u201cheld-to-\nmaturity\u201d (HTM) are securities that the Company has both the\nability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at\namortized cost. Interest income on such securities is included\nin Interest revenue . \u2022 Debt securities classified as\n\u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d (AFS) are carried at fair value with\nchanges in fair value reported in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) , a component of stockholders\u2019\nequity, net of applicable income taxes and hedges. Interest\nincome on such securities is included in Interest revenue .\n                              149                               \nFor investments in debt securities classified as HTM or AFS,\naccrued interest is subject to the Company\u2019s non-accrual policy,\nwhich results in the timely write-off of accrued interest.\nInvestment securities not measured at fair value through\nearnings include (i) debt securities held in HTM or AFS, (ii)\nequity securities accounted for under the measurement\nalternative or equity method, (iii) Federal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock and (iv) certain exchange\nmemberships. These securities are subject to evaluation for\nimpairment as described in Note 16 for HTM securities and in\nNote 14 for AFS, measurement alternative and equity method\ninvestments. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments\nare included in earnings, primarily on a specific identification\nbasis. The Company uses a number of valuation techniques for\ninvestments carried at fair value, which are described in Note\n26. Equity Securities \u2022 Marketable equity securities are\nmeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in\nearnings. \u2022 Non-marketable equity securities are measured at\nfair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings\nunless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the\ninvestment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan\nBank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried\nat cost. Non-marketable equity securities under the measurement\nalternative are carried at cost less impairment (if any), plus\nor minus changes resulting from observed prices for orderly\ntransactions for the identical or a similar investment of the\nsame issuer. \u2022 Certain investments that would otherwise have\nbeen accounted for using the equity method are carried at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recognized in earnings, since\nthe Company elected to apply fair value accounting. Trading\nAccount Assets and Liabilities Trading account assets include\ndebt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a\nreceivable position, residual interests in securitizations and\nphysical commodities inventory. In addition, as described in\nNote 27, certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at\nfair value under the fair value option, such as loans and\npurchased guarantees, are also included in Trading account\nassets . Trading account liabilities include securities sold,\nnot yet purchased (short positions) and derivatives in a net\npayable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup\nhas elected to carry at fair value (as described in Note 27).\nOther than physical commodities inventory, all trading account\nassets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Revenues\ngenerated from trading assets and trading liabilities are\ngenerally reported in Principal transactions and include\nrealized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses\nresulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments.\nInterest income on trading assets is recorded in Interest\nrevenue reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities.\nPhysical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost\nor market with related losses reported in Principal transactions\n, except when included in a hedging relationship. Realized gains\nand losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in\nPrincipal transactions . Investments in unallocated precious\nmetals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) are\naccounted for as hybrid instruments containing a debt host\ncontract and an embedded non-financial derivative instrument\nindexed to the price of the relevant precious metal. The\nembedded derivative instrument and debt host contract are\ncarried at fair value under the fair value option, as described\nin Note 27. Derivatives used for trading purposes include\ninterest rate, currency, equity, credit and commodity swap\nagreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial\nand commodity futures and forward contracts. Derivative asset\nand liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet when a valid master netting agreement\nexists and the other conditions set out in ASC Topic 210-20,\nBalance Sheet\u2014Offsetting , are met. See Note 24. The Company\nuses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of\ntrading assets and liabilities, which are described in Note 26.\nSecurities Borrowed and Securities Loaned Securities borrowing\nand lending transactions do not constitute a sale of the\nunderlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as\ncollateralized financing transactions. Such transactions are\nrecorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or received plus\naccrued interest. As described in Note 27, the Company has\nelected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities\nborrowing and lending transactions. Fees received or paid for\nall securities borrowing and lending transactions are recorded\nin Interest revenue or Interest expense at the contractually\nspecified rate. Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-1, Balance\nSheet\u2014Offsetting: Right of Setoff Conditions , are met,\nsecurities borrowing and lending transactions are presented net\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company monitors the fair\nvalue of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and\nobtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. As described in Note 26, the\nCompany uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the\nfair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions.\nRepurchase and Resale Agreements Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase (repos) and securities purchased under\nagreements to resell (reverse repos) do not constitute a sale\n(or purchase) of the underlying securities for accounting\npurposes and are treated as collateralized financing\ntransactions. As described in Note 27, the Company has elected\nto apply fair value accounting to certain portions of such\ntransactions, with changes in fair value reported in earnings.\nAny transactions for which fair value accounting has not been\nelected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received\nplus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has\nelected fair value accounting, interest paid or received on all\nrepo and reverse\n                              150                               \nrepo transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest\nrevenue at the contractually specified rate. Where the\nconditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet\u2014Offsetting:\nRepurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements , are met, repos\nand reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The Company\u2019s policy is to take possession of securities\npurchased under reverse repurchase agreements. The Company\nmonitors the fair value of securities subject to repurchase or\nresale on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.\nAs described in Note 26, the Company uses a discounted cash flow\ntechnique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo\ntransactions. Loans Loans are reported at their outstanding\nprincipal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized\ndeferred fees and costs, except for credit card receivable\nbalances, which include accrued interest and fees. Loan\norigination fees and certain direct origination costs are\ngenerally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over\nthe lives of the related loans. As described in Note 27, Citi\nhas elected fair value accounting for certain loans. Such loans\nare carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in\nearnings. Interest income on such loans is recorded in Interest\nrevenue at the contractually specified rate. Loans that are\nheld-for-investment are classified as Loans, net of unearned\nincome on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash\nflows are included within the cash flows from the investing\nactivities category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\non the line Change in loans . However, when the initial intent\nfor holding a loan has changed from held-for-investment to held-\nfor-sale (HFS), the loan is reclassified to HFS, but the related\ncash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing\nactivities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the\nline Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans . Consumer\nLoans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed\nprimarily by the USPB , Wealth and All Other\u2014 Legacy Franchises\nbusinesses (except Mexico SBMM loans). Consumer Non-accrual and\nRe-aging Policies As a general rule, interest accrual ceases for\ninstallment and real estate (both open- and closed-end) loans\nwhen payments are 90days contractually past due. For credit\ncards and other unsecured revolving loans, however, Citi\ngenerally accrues interest until payments are 180days past due.\nAs a result of OCC guidance, home equity loans in regulated bank\nentities are classified as non-accrual if the related\nresidential first mortgage is 90days or more past due. Also as a\nresult of OCC guidance, mortgage loans in regulated bank\nentities are classified as non-accrual within 60days of\nnotification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy, with\nthe exception of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\u2013insured\nloans. Loans that have been modified to grant a concession to a\nborrower in financial difficulty may not be accruing interest at\nthe time of the modification. The policy for returning such\nmodified loans to accrual status varies by product and/or\nregion. In most cases, a minimum number of payments (ranging\nfrom oneto six) is required, while in other cases the loan is\nnever returned to accrual status. For regulated bank entities,\nsuch modified loans are returned to accrual status if a credit\nevaluation at the time of, or subsequent to, the modification\nindicates the borrower is able to meet the restructured terms,\nand the borrower is current and has demonstrated a reasonable\nperiod of sustained payment performance (minimum six monthsof\nconsecutive payments). For U.S. consumer loans, generally one of\nthe conditions to qualify for modification (other than for loan\nmodifications made through the CARES Act relief provisions or\nbanking agency guidance for pandemic-related issues) is that a\nminimum number of payments (typically ranging from oneto three)\nmust be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to current\nstatus. However, re-aging practices for certain open-ended\nconsumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines.\nFor open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one\nof the conditions for the loan to be re-aged to current status\nis that at least threeconsecutive minimum monthly payments, or\nthe equivalent amount, must be received. In addition, under\nFFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such a loan can be\nre-aged is subject to limitations (generally once in 12 months\nand twice in five years). Furthermore, FHA and Department of\nVeterans Affairs (VA) loans may only be modified under those\nrespective agencies\u2019 guidelines, and payments are not always\nrequired in order to re-age a modified loan to current. Consumer\nCharge-Off Policies Citi\u2019s charge-off policies follow the\ngeneral guidelines below: \u2022 Unsecured installment loans are\ncharged off at 120days contractually past due. \u2022 Unsecured\nrevolving loans and credit card loans are charged off at 180days\ncontractually past due. \u2022 Loans secured with non-real estate\ncollateral are written down to the estimated value of the\ncollateral, less costs to sell, at 120days contractually past\ndue. \u2022 Real estate-secured loans are written down to the\nestimated value of the property, less costs to sell, at 180days\ncontractually past due. \u2022 Real estate-secured loans are charged\noff no later than 180days contractually past due if a decision\nhas been made not to foreclose on the loans. \u2022 Unsecured loans\nin bankruptcy are charged off within 60days of notification of\nfiling by the bankruptcy court or in accordance with Citi\u2019s\ncharge-off policy, whichever occurs earlier. \u2022 Real estate-\nsecured loans in bankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans, are\nwritten down to the estimated value of the property, less costs\nto sell, within 60days of notification that the borrower has\nfiled for bankruptcy or in accordance with Citi\u2019s charge-off\npolicy, whichever is earlier.\n                              151                               \nCorporate Loans Corporate loans represent loans and leases\nmanaged by Services , Markets and Banking and the Mexico SBMM\ncomponent of All Other \u2014Legacy Franchises. Corporate loans are\nidentified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis\nwhen it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-\nlooking assessment of the collectibility of the loan in full,\nthat the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when\ninterest or principal is 90days past due, except when the loan\nis well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any\ninterest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is\nreversed at 90days past due and charged against current\nearnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only\nto the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate collectibility of principal, all cash\nreceipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded\ninvestment in the loan. Impaired corporate loans and leases are\nwritten down to the extent that principal is deemed to be\nuncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases,\nwhere repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of\nthe underlying collateral and there are no other available and\nreliable sources of repayment, are carried at the lower of\namortized cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are\nreturned to accrual status when all contractual principal and\ninterest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there\nis a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance\nwith the contractual terms. Loans Held-for-Sale Corporate and\nconsumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified\nas loans HFS and included in Other assets . The practice of\nCiti\u2019s U.S. prime mortgage business has been to sell\nsubstantially all of its conforming loans. As such, U.S. prime\nmortgage conforming loans are classified as HFS and the fair\nvalue option is elected at origination, with changes in fair\nvalue recorded in Other revenue . With the exception of those\nloans for which the fair value option has been elected, HFS\nloans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value,\nwith any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to Other\nrevenue . The related cash flows are classified in the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from\noperating activities category on the line Change in loans HFS .\nGains and losses on loans HFS are generally presented in Other\nrevenue . Gains on sales of fully or partially charged-off loans\nare presented as gross credit recoveries in the Provision for\ncredit losses up to the amount of prior charge-offs. Allowances\nfor Credit Losses (ACL) The current expected credit losses\n(CECL) methodology is based on relevant information about past\nevents, including historical experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable (R&S) forecasts that affect the\ncollectibility of the reported financial asset balances. If the\nasset\u2019s life extends beyond the R&S forecast period, then\nhistorical experience is considered over the remaining life of\nthe assets in the ACL. The resulting ACL is adjusted in each\nsubsequent reporting period through Provisions for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Income to reflect changes in\nhistory, current conditions and forecasts as well as changes in\nasset positions and portfolios. ASC 326 defines the ACL as a\nvaluation account that is deducted from the amortized cost of a\nfinancial asset to present the net amount that management\nexpects to collect on the financial asset over its expected\nlife. All financial assets carried at amortized cost are in the\nscope of ASC 326, while assets measured at fair value are\nexcluded. See Note 14 for a discussion of impairment on\navailable-for-sale (AFS) securities. Increases and decreases to\nthe allowances are recorded in Provisions for credit losses .\nThe CECL methodology utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss\n(ECL) measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses\nfor held-for-investment (HFI) loans, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt\nsecurities, receivables and other financial assets measured at\namortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or\nacquired. Within the life of a loan or other financial asset,\nthe methodology generally results in earlier recognition of the\nprovision for credit losses and the related ACL. Estimation of\nECLs requires Citi to make assumptions regarding the likelihood\nand severity of credit loss events and their impact on expected\ncash flows, which drive the probability of default (PD), loss\ngiven default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) models and,\nwhere Citi discounts the ECL, using discounting techniques for\ncertain products. Citi considers a multitude of global\nmacroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside\nprobability-weighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to\nestimate the ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate\nand U.S. real GDP growth rate represent the key macroeconomic\nvariables that most significantly affect its estimate of the\nACL. Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of 4Q23, U.S. real\nGDP growth is expected to decline during 2024, and the\nunemployment rate is expected to increase modestly over the\nforecast horizon, broadly returning to pre-pandemic levels. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical\nmodel, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and\nother macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates\nscenario weights on a quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the\nbase scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario reflects a recession, including an\nelevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% over the eight-\nquarter R&S period, with a peak difference of 3.2% in the second\nquarter of 2025. The downside scenario also reflects a year-\nover-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2024 of 1.9%, with a peak\nquarter-over-quarter difference to the base scenario of 1.2% in\nthe first quarter of 2024.\n                              152                               \nThe following are the main factors and interpretations that Citi\nconsiders when estimating the ACL under the CECL methodology: \u2022\nCECL reserves are estimated over the contractual term of the\nfinancial asset, which is adjusted for expected prepayments.\nExpected extensions are generally not considered unless the\noption to extend the loan cannot be canceled unilaterally by\nCiti. \u2022 Credit enhancements that are not freestanding (such as\nthose that are included in the original terms of the contract or\nthose executed in conjunction with the lending transaction) are\nconsidered loss mitigants for purposes of CECL reserve\nestimation. \u2022 For unconditionally cancelable accounts (generally\ncredit cards), reserves are based on the expected life of the\nbalance as of the evaluation date (assuming no further charges)\nand do not include any undrawn commitments that are\nunconditionally cancelable. Reserves are included for undrawn\ncommitments for accounts that are not unconditionally cancelable\n(such as letters of credit and corporate loan commitments, home\nequity lines of credit (HELOCs), undrawn mortgage loan\ncommitments and financial guarantees). \u2022 CECL models are\ndesigned to be economically sensitive. They utilize the\nmacroeconomic forecasts provided by Citi\u2019s enterprise scenario\ngroup that are approved by senior management. Analysis is\nperformed and documented to determine the necessary qualitative\nmanagement adjustment (QMA) to capture idiosyncratic events and\nmodel uncertainty. \u2022 The portion of the forecast that reflects\nthe enterprise scenario group\u2019s R&S period indicates the maximum\nlength of time its models can produce a R&S macroeconomic\nforecast, after which mean reversion reflecting historical loss\nexperience is used for the remaining life of the loan to\nestimate expected credit losses. For the loss forecast,\nbusinesses consume the macroeconomic forecast as determined to\nbe appropriate and justifiable. Citi\u2019s ability to forecast\ncredit losses over the R&S period is based on the ability to\nforecast economic activity over a reasonable and supportable\ntime window. The R&S period reflects the overall ability to have\na reasonable and supportable forecast of credit loss based on\neconomic forecasts. The R&S forecast period for consumer and\ncorporate loans is eight quarters. \u2022 The loss models consume all\nor a portion of the R&S economic forecast and then revert to\nhistorical loss experience. \u2022 The ACL incorporates provisions\nfor accrued interest on products that are not subject to a non-\naccrual and timely write-off policy (e.g., credit cards, etc.).\n\u2022 Citi uses the most recent available information to inform its\nmacroeconomic forecasts, allowing sufficient time for analysis\nof the results and corresponding approvals. Key variables are\nreviewed for significant changes through year end and changes to\nportfolio positions are reflected in the ACL. \u2022 Reserves are\ncalculated at an appropriately granular level and on a pooled\nbasis where financial assets share risk characteristics. At a\nminimum, reserves are calculated at a portfolio level (product\nand country). Where a financial asset does not share risk\ncharacteristics with any of the pools, it is evaluated for\ncredit losses individually. Quantitative and Qualitative\nComponents of the ACL The loss likelihood and severity models\nuse both internal and external information and are sensitive to\nforecasts of different macroeconomic conditions. For the\nquantitative component, Citi uses multiple macroeconomic\nscenarios and associated probabilities to estimate the ECL.\nEstimates of these ECLs are based upon (i) Citigroup\u2019s internal\nsystem of credit risk ratings, (ii) historical default and loss\ndata, including comprehensive internal history and rating agency\ninformation regarding default rates and internal data on the\nseverity of losses in the event of default, and (iii) a R&S\nforecast of future macroeconomic conditions. ECL is determined\nprimarily by utilizing models for the borrowers\u2019 PD, LGD and\nEAD. Adjustments may be made to this data, including (i)\nstatistically calculated estimates to cover the historical\nfluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, the\nhistorical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans\nand the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations\nin the global portfolio, and (ii) adjustments made for\nspecifically known items, such as current environmental factors\nand credit trends. Any adjustments needed to the modeled\nexpected losses in the quantitative calculations are addressed\nthrough a qualitative adjustment. The qualitative adjustment\nconsiders, among other things: certain portfolio characteristics\nand concentrations; collateral coverage; model limitations;\nidiosyncratic events; and other relevant criteria under banking\nsupervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative adjustment\nalso reflects the estimated impact of the pandemic on the\neconomic forecasts and the impact on credit loss estimates. The\ntotal ACL is composed of the quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Citi\u2019s qualitative component declined year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by the incorporation of multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios in the quantitative component and\nreleases of COVID-19\u2013related uncertainty reserves as the\nportfolio continues to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels and\nas these risks are now captured in the quantitative component of\nthe ACL. See \u201cAccounting Changes\u201d below for information about\nhow the calculation of the quantitative component of the ACL\nchanged in 2023. Consumer Loans For consumer loans, most\nportfolios including North America cards, mortgages and personal\ninstallment loans (PILs) are covered by the PD, LGD and EAD loss\nforecasting models. Some smaller international portfolios are\ncovered by econometric models where the gross credit loss (GCL)\nrate is forecast. The modeling of all retail products is\nperformed by examining risk drivers for a given portfolio; these\ndrivers relate to exposures with similar credit risk\ncharacteristics and consider past events, current conditions and\nR&S forecasts. Under the PD x LGD x EAD approach, GCLs and\nrecoveries are captured on an undiscounted basis. Citi\nincorporates\n                              153                               \nexpected recoveries on loans into its reserve estimate,\nincluding expected recoveries on assets previously written off.\nCECL defines the exposure\u2019s expected life as the remaining\ncontractual maturity including any expected prepayments.\nSubsequent changes to the contractual terms that are the result\nof a re-underwriting are not included in the loan\u2019s expected\nCECL life. Citi does not establish reserves for the\nuncollectible accrued interest on non-revolving consumer\nproducts, such as mortgages and installment loans, which are\nsubject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy at 90 days\npast due. As such, only the principal balance is subject to the\nCECL reserve methodology and interest does not attract a further\nreserve. For credit cards, Citi uses the payment rate approach,\nwhich leverages payment rate curves, to determine the payments\nthat should be applied to liquidate the end-of-period balance\n(CECL balance) in the estimation of EAD. The payment rate\napproach uses customer payment behavior (payment rate) to\nestablish the portion of the CECL balance that will be paid each\nmonth. These payment rates are defined as the percentage of\nprincipal payments received in the respective month divided by\nthe prior month\u2019s billed principal balance. The liquidation\n(CECL payment) amount for each forecast period is determined by\nmultiplying the CECL balance by that period\u2019s forecasted payment\nrate. The cumulative sum of these payments less the CECL balance\nproduces the balance liquidation curve. Citi does not apply a\nnon-accrual policy to credit card receivables; rather, they are\nsubject to full charge-off at 180 days past due or bankruptcy.\nAs such, the entire customer balance up until write-off,\nincluding accrued interest and fees, is subject to the CECL\nreserve methodology. Corporate Loans, HTM Securities and Other\nAssets Citi records allowances for credit losses on all\nfinancial assets carried at amortized cost that are in the scope\nof CECL, including corporate loans classified as HFI, HTM debt\nsecurities and Other assets . Discounting techniques are applied\nfor corporate loans classified as HFI and HTM securities. All\ncash flows are fully discounted to the reporting date. The ACL\nincludes Citi\u2019s estimate of all credit losses expected to be\nincurred over the estimated full contractual life of the\nfinancial asset. The contractual life of the financial asset\ndoes not include expected extensions, renewals or modifications.\nWhere Citi has an unconditional option to extend the contractual\nterm, Citi does not consider the potential extension in\ndetermining the contractual term; however, where the borrower\nhas the sole right to exercise the extension option without\nCiti\u2019s approval, Citi does consider the potential extension in\ndetermining the contractual term. The Company primarily bases\nits ACL on models that assess the likelihood and severity of\ncredit events and their impact on cash flows under R&S\nforecasted economic scenarios. Allowances consider the\nprobability of the borrower\u2019s default, the loss the Company\nwould incur upon default and the borrower\u2019s exposure at default.\nSuch models discount the present value of all future cash flows,\nusing the asset\u2019s effective interest rate (EIR). Citi applies a\nmore simplified approach based on historical loss rates to\ncertain exposures recorded in Other assets and certain loan\nexposures in the Private Bank within Consumer loans . The\nCompany considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero for U.S.\nTreasuries and U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, as such, Citi does not\nhave an ACL for these securities. For all other HTM debt\nsecurities, ECLs are estimated using PD models and discounting\ntechniques, which incorporate assumptions regarding the\nlikelihood and severity of credit losses. For structured\nsecurities, specific models use relevant assumptions for the\nunderlying collateral type. A discounting approach is applied to\nHTM direct obligations of a single issuer, similar to that used\nfor corporate HFI loans. Other Financial Assets with Zero\nExpected Credit Losses For certain financial assets, zero\nexpected credit losses will be recognized where the expectation\nof nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, based on\nthere being no history of loss and the nature of the\nreceivables. Secured Financing Transactions Most of Citi\u2019s\nreverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing arrangements\nand margin loans require that the borrower continually adjust\nthe amount of the collateral securing Citi\u2019s interest, primarily\nresulting from changes in the fair value of such collateral. In\nsuch arrangements, ACLs are recorded based only on the amount by\nwhich the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of\nthe collateral. No ACLs are recorded where the fair value of the\ncollateral is equal to or exceeds the asset\u2019s amortized cost\nbasis, as Citi does not expect to incur credit losses on such\nwell-collateralized exposures. For certain margin loans\npresented in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, ACLL is\nestimated using the same approach as corporate loans. Accrued\nInterest CECL permits entities to make an accounting policy\nelection not to reserve for interest, if the entity has a policy\nin place that will result in timely reversal or write-off of\ninterest. However, when a non-accrual or timely charge-off\npolicy is not applied, an ACL is recognized on accrued interest\nat 90 days past due. For HTM debt securities, Citi established a\nnon-accrual policy that results in timely write-off of accrued\ninterest. For corporate loans, where a timely charge-off policy\nis used, Citi has elected to recognize an ACL on accrued\ninterest receivable. The LGD models for corporate loans include\nan adjustment for estimated accrued interest. Reasonably\nExpected TDRs (in 2022 and prior years) For corporate loans, the\nreasonable expectation of the TDR concept requires that the\ncontractual life over which ECLs are estimated be extended when\na TDR that results in a tenor extension is reasonably expected.\nReasonably expected TDRs are included in the life of the asset.\nA discounting technique or collateral-dependent practical\nexpedient is used for non-accrual and TDR loan exposures that do\nnot share risk characteristics with other loans and are\nindividually assessed. Loans modified in accordance with the\nCARES Act and bank regulatory guidance are not classified as\nTDRs.\n                              154                               \nIn 2023, the reasonably expected TDRs accounting was replaced by\nmodifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty accounting. See \u201cAccounting Changes\u2014TDRs and Vintage\nDisclosures\u201d below for a description of this new accounting.\nPurchased Credit-Deteriorated (PCD) Assets ASC 326 requires\nentities that have acquired financial assets (such as loans and\nHTM securities) with an intent to hold, to evaluate whether\nthose assets have experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since origination. These assets\nare subject to specialized accounting at initial recognition\nunder CECL. Subsequent measurement of PCD assets will remain\nconsistent with other purchased or originated assets, i.e., non-\nPCD assets. CECL introduces the notion of PCD assets, which\nreplaces purchased credit impaired (PCI) accounting under prior\nU.S. GAAP. CECL requires the estimation of credit losses to be\nperformed on a pool basis unless a PCD asset does not share\ncharacteristics with any pool. If certain PCD assets do not meet\nthe conditions for aggregation, those PCD assets should be\naccounted for separately. This determination must be made at the\ndate the PCD asset is purchased. In estimating ECLs from day 2\nonward, pools can potentially be reassembled based upon similar\nrisk characteristics. When PCD assets are pooled, Citi\ndetermines the amount of the initial ACL at the pool level. The\namount of the initial ACL for a PCD asset represents the portion\nof the total discount at acquisition that relates to credit and\nis recognized as a \u201cgross-up\u201d of the purchase price to arrive at\nthe PCD asset\u2019s (or pool\u2019s) amortized cost. Any difference\nbetween the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost is\nconsidered to be related to non-credit factors and results in a\ndiscount or premium, which is amortized to interest income over\nthe life of the individual asset (or pool). Direct expenses\nincurred related to the acquisition of PCD assets and other\nassets and liabilities in a business combination are expensed as\nincurred. Subsequent accounting for acquired PCD assets is the\nsame as the accounting for originated assets; changes in the\nallowance are recorded in Provisions for credit losses .\nConsumer Citi does not purchase whole portfolios of PCD assets\nin its retail businesses. However, there may be a small portion\nof a purchased portfolio that is identified as PCD at the\npurchase date. Interest income recognition does not vary between\nPCD and non-PCD assets. A consumer financial asset is considered\nto be more-than-insignificantly credit deteriorated if it is\nmore than 30 days past due at the purchase date. Corporate Citi\ngenerally classifies wholesale loans and debt securities\nclassified as HTM or AFS as PCD when both of the following\ncriteria are met: (i) the purchase price discount is at least\n10% of par and (ii) the purchase date is more than 90 days after\nthe origination or issuance date. Citi classifies HTM beneficial\ninterests rated AA- and lower obtained at origination from\ncertain securitization transactions as PCD when there is a\nsignificant difference (i.e., 10% or greater) between\ncontractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayments, and expected\ncash flows at the date of recognition. Reserve Estimates and\nPolicies Management provides reserves for an estimate of\nlifetime ECLs in the funded loan portfolio on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet in the form of an ACL. These reserves are\nestablished in accordance with Citigroup\u2019s credit reserve\npolicies, as approved by the Audit Committee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors. Citi\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer review the adequacy of the credit loss\nreserves each quarter with risk management and finance\nrepresentatives for each applicable business area. Applicable\nbusiness areas include those having classifiably managed\nportfolios, where internal credit risk ratings are assigned\n(primarily Services , Markets , Banking and Wealth ) and\ndelinquency-managed portfolios (primarily USPB ) or modified\nconsumer loans, where concessions were granted due to the\nborrowers\u2019 financial difficulties. The aforementioned\nrepresentatives for these business areas present recommended\nreserve balances for their funded and unfunded lending\nportfolios along with supporting quantitative and qualitative\ndata discussed below. Estimated Credit Losses for Portfolios of\nPerforming Exposures Risk management and finance representatives\nwho cover business areas with delinquency-managed portfolios\ncontaining smaller-balance homogeneous loans present their\nrecommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators,\nincluding loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as\nwell as economic trends, including current and future housing\nprices, unemployment, length of time in foreclosure, costs to\nsell and GDP. This methodology is applied separately for each\nproduct within each geographic region in which these portfolios\nexist. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates\nand judgments. Risk management and finance representatives who\ncover business areas with classifiably managed portfolios\npresent their recommended reserve balances based on the\nfrequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, size\nand diversity of individual large credits, and ability of\nborrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the\nforeign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing. Changes\nin these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit\ncosts in any period and could result in a change in the\nallowance. Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments Credit\nloss reserves are recognized on all off-balance sheet\ncommitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. Corporate\nloan EAD models include an incremental usage factor (or credit\nconversion factor) to estimate ECLs on amounts undrawn at the\nreporting date. Off-balance sheet commitments include unfunded\nexposures, revolving facilities, securities underwriting\ncommitments, letters of credit, HELOCs and financial guarantees\n(excluding performance guarantees). This reserve is classified\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other liabilities . Changes\nto the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded\nin Provision for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments .\n                              155                               \nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) Mortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs) are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or\nwhen the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through\npurchase or origination and retains the right to service the\nloans. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair\nvalue, with changes in value recorded in Other revenue in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s MSRs, see Notes 17 and 22. Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair\nvalue of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment\ntesting and interim assessments between annual tests if an event\noccurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying\namount. The Company has determined that its reporting units are\nat the reportable operating segment level or one level below.\nThe Company has an option to assess qualitative factors to\ndetermine if it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment\ntest. If, after assessing the totality of events or\ncircumstances, the Company determines that it is not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less\nthan its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If,\nhowever, the Company determines that it is more-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\ncarrying amount, then the Company must perform the quantitative\ntest. The Company has an unconditional option to bypass the\nqualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any reporting\nperiod and proceed directly to the quantitative test. The\nquantitative test requires a comparison of the fair value of the\nindividual reporting unit to its carrying value, including\ngoodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess\nof the carrying value, the related goodwill is considered not\nimpaired and no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying\nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, an\nimpairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess,\nlimited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit. Upon any business disposition, goodwill is\nallocated to, and derecognized with, the disposed business based\non the ratio of the fair value of the disposed business to the\nfair value of the reporting unit. During the year ended December\n31, 2022, the Company voluntarily changed its annual impairment\nassessment date from July 1 to October 1. Additional information\non Citi\u2019s goodwill impairment testing can be found in Note 17.\nIntangible Assets Intangible assets\u2014 including core deposit\nintangibles, present value of future profits, purchased credit\ncard relationships, credit card contract-related intangibles,\nother customer relationships and other intangible assets, but\nexcluding MSRs\u2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nCredit card contract-related intangibles include fixed and\nunconditional costs incurred to renew or extend the contract\nwith a card partner. In estimating the useful life of a credit\ncard contract-related intangible, the Company considers the\nprobability of contract renewal or extension to determine the\nperiod that the asset is expected to contribute future cash\nflows. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite\nuseful lives, primarily trade names, are not amortized and are\nsubject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the\ncarrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds\nits fair value. For other intangible assets subject to\namortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount\nis not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible\nasset. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment includes\nlease right-of-use assets, property and equipment (including\npurchased and developed software), net of depreciation and\namortization. Substantially all lease right-of-use assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and\nsubstantially all property and equipment is depreciated or\namortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the\nasset. Other Assets and Other Liabilities Other assets include,\namong other items, loans HFS, deferred tax assets, equity method\ninvestments, interest and fees receivable, repossessed assets,\nother receivables and assets from businesses classified as HFS\nthat are reclassified from other balance sheet line items. Other\nliabilities include, among other items, accrued expenses, lease\nliabilities, deferred tax liabilities, reserves for legal claims\nand legal fee accruals, taxes, unfunded lending commitments,\nrepositioning reserves, other payables and liabilities from\nbusinesses classified as HFS that are reclassified from other\nbalance sheet line items. Legal fee accruals are recognized as\nincurred. Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets Real\nestate or other assets received through foreclosure or\nrepossession are generally reported in Other assets , net of a\nvaluation allowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in\nfair value. Securitizations There are two key accounting\ndeterminations that must be made relating to securitizations.\nCiti first makes a determination as to whether the\nsecuritization entity must be consolidated. Second, it\ndetermines whether the transfer of financial assets to the\nentity is considered a sale under GAAP. If the securitization\nentity is a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the\nprimary beneficiary (as discussed in \u201cVariable Interest\nEntities\u201d above). For all other securitization entities\ndetermined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates,\nconsolidation is based on which party has voting control of the\nentity, giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights\nin certain partnership structures. Only securitization entities\ncontrolled by Citigroup are consolidated. Interests in the\nsecuritized and sold assets may be retained in the form of\nsubordinated or senior interest-only strips, subordinated\ntranches, spread accounts and servicing rights. In credit card\nsecuritizations, the Company retains a seller\u2019s interest in the\ncredit card receivables transferred to the trusts,\n                              156                               \nwhich is not in securitized form. In the case of consolidated\nsecuritization entities, including the credit card trusts, these\nretained interests are not reported on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The securitized loans remain on the Balance\nSheet. Substantially all of the consumer loans sold or\nsecuritized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup are\nU.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in\nnon-consolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified\nas Trading account assets , except for MSRs, which are included\nin Intangible assets on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDebt Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for\nat amortized cost, except where the Company has elected to\nreport the debt instruments (including certain structured notes)\nat fair value, or debt that is in a fair value hedging\nrelationship. Premiums, discounts and issuance costs on long-\nterm debt accounted for at amortized cost are amortized over the\ncontractual term using the effective interest method. Transfers\nof Financial Assets For a transfer of financial assets to be\nconsidered a sale, (i) the assets must be legally isolated from\nthe Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the\npurchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets\ntransferred (or, if the purchaser is an entity whose sole\npurpose is to engage in securitization and asset-backed\nfinancing activities through the issuance of beneficial\ninterests and that entity is constrained from pledging the\nassets it receives, each beneficial interest holder must have\nthe right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests), and\n(iii) the Company may not have an option or obligation to\nreacquire the assets. If these sale requirements are met, the\nassets are removed from the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is\nconsidered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized\nas the Company\u2019s liability. A legal opinion on a sale generally\nis obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has\ncontinuing involvement with the assets transferred or with the\nsecuritization entity. For a transfer to be eligible for sale\naccounting, that opinion must state that the asset transfer\nwould be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would\nnot be consolidated with the Company\u2019s other assets in the event\nof the Company\u2019s insolvency.See Note 23 for further discussion.\nRisk Management Activities\u2014Derivatives Used for Hedging Purposes\nThe Company manages its exposures to market movements outside of\nits trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix,\neither directly or through the use of derivative financial\nproducts, including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards,\npurchased options and commodities, as well as foreign-exchange\ncontracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value\nin Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities . See\nNote 24 for a further discussion of the Company\u2019s hedging and\nderivative activities. Instrument-Specific Credit Risk Citi\npresents separately in AOCI the portion of the total change in\nthe fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the\ninstrument-specific credit risk, when the entity has elected to\nmeasure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair\nvalue option for financial instruments. Accordingly, the change\nin fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option was\nelected related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit spreads is\npresented in AOCI . Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits\nexpense includes current service costs of pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans (which are accrued on a current\nbasis), contributions and unrestricted awards under other\nemployee plans, the amortization of restricted stock awards and\ncosts of other employee benefits. For its most significant\npension and postretirement benefit plans (Significant Plans),\nCitigroup measures and discloses plan obligations, plan assets\nand periodic plan expense quarterly, instead of annually. The\neffect of remeasuring the Significant Plan obligations and\nassets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly\nbasis is reflected in AOCI and periodic plan expense. All other\nplans (All Other Plans) are remeasured annually. Benefits earned\nduring the year are reported in Compensation and benefits\nexpenses and all other components of the net annual benefit cost\nare reported in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income.See Note 8. Stock-Based Compensation The\nCompany recognizes compensation expense related to stock awards\nover the requisite service period, generally based on the\ninstruments\u2019 grant-date fair value, reduced by actual\nforfeitures as they occur. Compensation cost related to awards\ngranted to employees who meet certain age plus years-of-service\nrequirements (retirement-eligible employees) is accrued in the\nyear prior to the grant date in the same manner as the accrual\nfor cash incentive compensation. Certain stock awards with\nperformance conditions or certain clawback provisions are\nsubject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the associated\ncompensation expense fluctuates with changes in Citigroup\u2019s\ncommon stock price.See Note 7. Income Taxes The Company is\nsubject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and its states and\nmunicipalities, as well as the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which\nit operates. These tax laws are complex and may be subject to\ndifferent interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant\ngovernmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for\nincome tax expense, the Company must make judgments and\ninterpretations about these tax laws. The Company must also make\nestimates about when in the future certain items will affect\ntaxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic\nand foreign. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may\nbe subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of\nthe various tax jurisdictions, or may be settled with the taxing\nauthority upon examination or audit. The Company treats interest\nand penalties on income taxes as a component of Income tax\nexpense .\n                              157                               \nDeferred taxes are recorded for the future consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in financial statements or tax\nreturns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax\nassets are recognized subject to management\u2019s judgment about\nwhether realization is more-likely-than-not. ASC 740, Income\nTaxes , sets out a consistent framework to determine the\nappropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax\npositions. This interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein\na tax benefit is recognized if a position is more-likely-than-\nnot to be sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured\nto be the highest tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be\nrealized. ASC 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to\nenhance transparency of an entity\u2019s tax reserves. See Note 10\nfor a further description of the Company\u2019s tax provision and\nrelated income tax assets and liabilities. Commissions,\nUnderwriting and Principal Transactions Commissions and fees\nrevenues are recognized in income when earned. Underwriting\nrevenues are recognized in income typically at the closing of\nthe transaction. Principal transactions revenues are recognized\nin income on a trade-date basis.See Note 5 for a description of\nthe Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies for Commissions and\nfees , and Note 6 for details of Principal transactions revenue.\nEarnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated using\nthe two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings\n(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock\nand participating securities. Undistributed earnings are\ncalculated after deducting preferred stock dividends, any\nissuance cost incurred at the time of issuance of redeemed\npreferred stock and dividends paid and accrued to common stocks\nand RSU/DSA share awards. Citi grants restricted and deferred\nshare awards under its shares-based compensation programs, which\nentitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during\nthe vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to\nholders of the Company\u2019s common stock. These unvested awards\nmeet the definition of participating securities based on their\nrespective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they\nare treated as a separate class of securities and are not\nincluded in computing basic EPS. Diluted EPS incorporates the\npotential impact of contingently issuable shares, stock options\nand awards, which require future service as a condition of\ndelivery of the underlying common stock. Anti-dilutive options\nand warrants are disregarded in the EPS calculations. Diluted\nEPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock\nmethods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Participating\nsecurities are not included as incremental shares in computing\ndiluted EPS. Use of Estimates Management must make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements\nand the related Notes. Such estimates are used in connection\nwith certain fair value measurements. See Note 26 for further\ndiscussions on estimates used in the determination of fair\nvalue. Moreover, estimates are significant in determining the\namounts of other- than-temporary impairments, impairments of\ngoodwill and other intangible assets, provisions for probable\nlosses that may arise from credit-related exposures, probable\nand estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory\nproceedings, and income taxes. While management makes its best\njudgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those\nestimates. Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Flows Cash\nequivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and\ndue from banks and Deposits with banks . Certain cash balances\nare restricted by regulatory or contractual requirements.See\nNote 28 for additional information on restricted cash. Related\nParty Transactions The Company has related party transactions\nwith certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates. These\ntransactions, which are primarily short-term in nature, include\ncash accounts, collateralized financing transactions, margin\naccounts, derivative transactions, charges for operational\nsupport and the borrowing and lending of funds, and are entered\ninto in the ordinary course of business. ACCOUNTING CHANGES TDRs\nand Vintage Disclosures In March 2022, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures . Citi adopted the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2023, including the guidance on the recognition and\nmeasurement of TDRs under the modified retrospective approach.\nAdopting these amendments resulted in a decrease to the ACLL of\n$ 352million and an increase in other assets related to held-\nfor-sale businesses of $ 40million, with a corresponding\nincrease to retained earnings of $ 290million and a decrease in\ndeferred tax assets of $ 102million on January 1, 2023. The ACL\nfor corporate loans was unaffected because the measurement\napproach used for corporate loans is not in the scope of this\nASU. ASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and disclosure\nrequirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the\nACLL for TDRs using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. With\nthe elimination of TDR accounting requirements, reasonably\nexpected TDRs are no longer considered when determining the term\nover which to estimate expected credit losses. The ACLL for\nmodified loans that are collateral dependent continues to be\nbased on the fair value of the collateral. Consumer Loans Upon\nadoption of the ASU on January 1, 2023, Citi discontinued the\nuse of a DCF approach for consumer loans formerly considered\nTDRs. Beginning January 1, 2023, Citi measures the ACLL for all\nconsumer loans under approaches that do not incorporate\ndiscounting, primarily utilizing models that consider the\nborrowers\u2019 probability of default, loss given default and\nexposure at default. In addition, upon adoption of the ASU, Citi\ncollectively evaluates smaller-balance\n                              158                               \nhomogeneous loans formerly considered TDRs for expected credit\nlosses, whereas previously those loans had been individually\nevaluated. The ASU also requires disclosure of modifications of\nloans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty if the\nmodification involves principal forgiveness, an interest rate\nreduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term\nextension or a combination of those types of modifications. In\naddition, the ASU requires the disclosure of current-period\ngross write-offs by year of loan origination (vintage). The\namendments related to disclosures are required to be applied\nprospectively beginning as of the date of adoption. See Note 14\nfor these new disclosures for periods beginning on and after\nJanuary 1, 2023. Long-Duration Insurance Contracts In August\n2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for\nLong-Duration Contracts , which changes the existing\nrecognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-\nduration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically,\nthe guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes\nin the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting\nfor certain market-based options or guarantees associated with\ndeposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred acquisition costs, and (iv) introduces\nadditional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has\ncertain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in Mexico, that issue\nlong-duration insurance contracts such as traditional life\ninsurance policies and life-contingent annuity contracts that\nare impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12. Citi adopted\nthe targeted improvements in ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023,\nresulting in a $ 39million decrease in Other liabilities and a $\n27million increase in AOCI , after-tax. Fair Value\nHedging\u2014Portfolio Layer Method In March 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value\nHedging\u2014Portfolio Layer Method , intended to better align hedge\naccounting with an organization\u2019s risk management strategies.\nSpecifically, the guidance expands the current single-layer\nmethod to allow multiple hedge layers of a single closed\nportfolio of qualifying assets, which include both prepayable\nand non-prepayable assets. Upon the adoption of the guidance,\nentities may elect to reclassify securities held-to-maturity to\nthe available-for-sale category provided that the reclassified\nsecurities are designated in a portfolio hedge. Coincident with\nthe adoption of this ASU, on January 1, 2023, Citi transferred\nHTM mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost and fair\nvalue of approximately $ 3.3billion and $ 3.4billion,\nrespectively, into AFS as permitted under the guidance, and\nhedged them under the portfolio layer method. Reference Rate\nReform On December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date\nof Topic 848 , which extends the period of time preparers can\nutilize the reference rate reform relief guidance. In 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting , which provides optional guidance to ease\nthe potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the\neffects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. In\n2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) delayed the\nintended cessation date of certain tenors of USD LIBOR to June\n30, 2023. To ensure that the relief in Topic 848 covers the\nperiod of time during which a significant number of\nmodifications may take place, the ASU defers the sunset date of\nTopic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The\nextension allows Citi to transition its remaining contracts and\nmaintain hedge accounting. The ASU was adopted by Citi upon\nissuance and did not impact financial results in 2022. Multiple\nMacroeconomic Scenarios-Based ACL Approach During the second\nquarter of 2022, Citi refined its ACL methodology to utilize\nmultiple macroeconomic scenarios to estimate its allowance for\ncredit losses. The ACL was previously estimated using a\ncombination of a single base-case forecast scenario as part of\nits quantitative component and a component of its qualitative\nmanagement adjustment that reflects economic uncertainty from\ndownside macroeconomic scenarios. As a result of this change,\nCiti now explicitly incorporates multiple macroeconomic\nscenarios\u2014base, upside, and downside\u2014and associated\nprobabilities in the quantitative component when estimating its\nACL, while still retaining certain of its qualitative management\nadjustments. This refinement represents a \u201cchange in accounting\nestimate\u201d under ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error\nCorrections , with prospective application beginning in the\nperiod of change. This change in accounting estimate resulted in\na decrease of approximately $ 0.3billion in the allowance for\ncredit losses in the second quarter of 2022, partially\noffsetting an increase of $ 0.8billion in the allowance for\ncredit losses due to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty and\nother factors in the second quarter of 2022. FUTURE ACCOUNTING\nCHANGES Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets In\nDecember 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08,\nIntangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other\u2014Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60):\nAccounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , intended to\nimprove the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an\nentity to measure those assets at fair value each reporting\nperiod, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The\namendments also improve the information provided to investors\nabout an entity\u2019s crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure\nabout significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions and\nchanges during the reporting period. The guidance is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted.\nCiti does not hold any crypto assets within the scope of the\nguidance.\n                              159                               \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740):\nImprovements to Income Tax\nDisclosures In December 2023,\nthe FASB issued ASU No.\n2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income\nTax Disclosures , intended to\nenhance the transparency and\ndecision usefulness of income\ntax disclosures. This guidance\nrequires that public business\nentities disclose on an annual\nbasis a tabular rate\nreconciliation in eight\nspecific categories\ndisaggregated by nature and\nfor foreign tax effects by\njurisdiction that meet a 5% of\npretax income multiplied by\nthe applicable statutory tax\nrate or greater threshold\nannually. The eight categories\ninclude state and local income\ntaxes, net of federal income\ntax effect; foreign tax\neffects; enactment of new tax\nlaws or tax credits; effect of\ncross-border tax laws;\nvaluation allowances;\nnontaxable items and\nnondeductible items; and\nchanges in unrecognized tax\nbenefits. Additional\ndisclosures include\nqualitative description of the\nstate and local jurisdictions\nthat contribute to the\nmajority (greater than 50%) of\nthe effect of the state and\nlocal income tax category and\nexplanation of the nature and\neffect of changes in\nindividual reconciling items.\nThe guidance also requires\nentities annually to disclose\nincome taxes paid (net of\nrefunds received)\ndisaggregated by federal,\nstate and foreign taxes and by\njurisdiction identified based\non the same 5% quantitative\nthreshold. The standard is\neffective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15,\n2024. The transition method is\nprospective with the\nretrospective method\npermitted. Citi plans to adopt\nthe ASU for the annual\nreporting period beginning on\nJanuary 1, 2025, and is\ncurrently evaluating the\nimpact on disclosures. Segment\nReporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures In\nNovember 2023, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2023-07, Segment\nReporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures , intended\nto improve reportable segments\ndisclosure requirements\nprimarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant\nsegment expenses. The ASU\nincludes a requirement to\ndisclose significant segment\nexpenses that are regularly\nprovided to the chief\noperating decision maker\n(CODM) and included within\neach reported measure of\nsegment profit or loss, the\ntitle and position of the\nCODM, an explanation of how\nthe CODM uses the reported\nmeasure(s) of segment profit\nor loss in assessing segment\nperformance and deciding how\nto allocate resources, and all\nsegments\u2019 profit or loss and\nassets disclosures currently\nrequired annually by Topic 280\nalong with those introduced by\nthe ASU to be reported on an\ninterim basis. The amendments\nalso clarified that public\nentities are not precluded\nfrom reporting additional\nmeasures of a segment\u2019s profit\nor loss that are regularly\nused by the CODM. The ASU is\nrequired to be adopted on a\nretrospective basis and will\nbe effective for Citi for its\nannual period ending December\n31, 2024 and interim periods\nfor the interim period\nbeginning on January 1, 2025.\nCiti is currently evaluating\nthe impact of the standard on\nits disclosure of reportable\nsegments and related\ndisclosures.\n\nAccounting for Investments in\nTax Credit Structures In March\n2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023-02, Investments\u2014Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures\n(Topic 323): Accounting for\nInvestments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the\nProportional Amortization\nMethod . The ASU expands the\nscope of tax equity\ninvestments eligible to apply\nthe proportional amortization\nmethod of accounting. Under\nthe proportional amortization\nmethod, the cost of an\neligible investment is\namortized in proportion to the\nincome tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits that are\nreceived by the investor, with\nthe amortization of the\ninvestment and the income tax\ncredits being presented net in\nthe income statement as\ncomponents of income tax\nexpense (benefit). The ASU\npermits the Company to elect\nto use the proportional\namortization method to account\nfor an expanded range of\neligible tax-incentivized\ninvestments if certain\nconditions are met. Citi\nadopted the ASU on January 1,\n2024, which did not have a\nmaterial impact to the\nfinancial statements of the\nCompany. Fair Value\nMeasurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\n. The ASU was issued to\naddress diversity in practice\nwhereby certain entities\nincluded the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when\nvaluing equity securities, and\nit clarifies that a\ncontractual restriction on the\nsale of an equity security\nshould not be considered part\nof the unit of account of the\nequity security and,\ntherefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair\nvalue. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to\ndisclose the fair value of\nequity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions,\nthe nature and remaining\nduration of the restrictions\nand the circumstances that\ncould cause a lapse in the\nrestrictions.

As a result, a CTA\nloss (net of hedges) in AOCI\nof approximately $ 400million\npretax ($ 345million after-\ntax) related to the legacy\noperation was released to\nearnings in 2022. Out of the\ntotal CTA release, a $\n260million pretax loss ($\n221million after-tax loss) was\nattributable to the Egg\nBanking business noted above,\nreported in Discontinued\noperations , and therefore the\ncorresponding CTA release was\nalso reported in Discontinued\noperations during 2022. The\nremaining CTA release of a $\n140million pretax loss ($\n124million after-tax loss)\nrelated to Legacy Holdings\nAssets was reported as part of\nContinuing operations within\nAll Other \u2014Legacy Franchises .\n\nWhile the legacy operation was\ndivested in multiple sales\nover the years, each\ntransaction did not result in\nsubstantial liquidation given\nthat Citi retained certain\nliabilities noted above, which\nwere gradually settled over\ntime until reaching the point\nof substantial liquidation\nduring 2022, triggering the\nrelease of the CTA loss to\nearnings.\n\nCash flows from Discontinued\noperations were not material\nfor the periods presented.\n                              161                               \nSignificant Disposals\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Citi had closed the sales of\nnineconsumer banking businesses within All Other \u2014Legacy\nFranchises .

OPERATING SEGMENTS                                         \n                                                                \nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2023, Citi changed its\nmanagement structure resulting in changes in its reportable\noperating segments to reflect how the CEO, who is the chief\noperating decision maker (CODM), manages the Company, including\nallocating resources and measuring performance. Citi reorganized\nits reporting into fivereportable operating segments: Services ,\nMarkets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking (USPB) and Wealth ,\nwith the remaining operations recorded in All Other , which\nincludes activities not assigned to a specific reportable\noperating segment, as well as discontinued operations.

The managed basis presents\ninvestors with a view of operating earnings that provides\nincreased transparency and clarity into the operational results\nof Citi\u2019s performance; improves the visibility of management\ndecisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables\nbetter comparison to peer companies; and allows Citi to provide\na long-term strategic view of the business going forward.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES; ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER FIDUCIARY FEES\n\nCommissions and Fees The primary components of Commissions and\nfees revenue are investment banking fees, brokerage commissions,\ncredit card and bank card income and deposit-related fees.\nInvestment banking fees are substantially composed of\nunderwriting and advisory revenues. Such fees are recognized at\nthe point in time when Citigroup\u2019s performance under the terms\nof a contractual arrangement is completed, which is typically at\nthe closing of a transaction. Reimbursed expenses related to\nthese transactions are recorded as revenue and are included\nwithin investment banking fees. In certain instances for\nadvisory contracts, Citi will receive amounts in advance of the\ndeal\u2019s closing. In these instances, the amounts received will be\nrecognized as a liability and not recognized in revenue until\nthe transaction closes. Investment banking fees are earned\nprimarily by Banking and Markets . See Note 3 for segment\nresults. Out-of-pocket expenses associated with underwriting\nactivity are deferred and recognized at the time the related\nrevenue is recognized, while out-of-pocket expenses associated\nwith advisory arrangements are expensed as incurred. In general,\nexpenses incurred related to investment banking transactions,\nwhether consummated or not, are recorded in Other operating\nexpenses . The Company has determined that it acts as principal\nin the majority of these transactions and therefore presents\nexpenses gross within Other operating expenses . Brokerage\ncommissions primarily include commissions and fees from the\nfollowing: executing transactions for clients on exchanges and\nover-the-counter markets; sales of mutual funds and other\nannuity products; and assisting clients in clearing\ntransactions, providing brokerage services and other such\nactivities. Brokerage commissions are recognized in Commissions\nand fees at the point in time the associated service is\nfulfilled, generally on the trade execution date. Certain costs\npaid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges are recorded\nnet against commission revenue, as the Company is an agent for\nthose services. Sales of certain investment products include a\nportion of variable consideration associated with the underlying\nproduct. In these instances, a portion of the revenue associated\nwith the sale of the product is not recognized until the\nvariable consideration becomes fixed and determinable. Brokerage\ncommissions are earned primarily by Markets and Wealth . See\nNote 3 for segment results. Credit card and bank card income is\nprimarily composed of interchange fees, which are earned by card\nissuers based on card spend volumes, and certain card fees,\nincluding annual fees. Costs related to customer reward programs\nand certain payments to partners (primarily based on program\nsales, profitability and customer acquisitions) are recorded as\na reduction of credit card and bank card income. Citi\u2019s credit\ncard programs have certain partner sharing agreements that vary\nby partner. These partner sharing agreements are subject to\ncontractually based performance thresholds that, if met, would\nrequire Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner. The\nthreshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\n\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses, which,\nto the extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces\nCiti\u2019s liability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program\nyear, would generally result in lower payments to partners in\ntotal for that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances,\nother partner payments are based on program sales and new\naccount acquisitions. Interchange revenues are recognized as\nearned on a daily basis when Citi\u2019s performance obligation to\ntransmit funds to the payment networks has been satisfied.\nAnnual card fees, net of origination costs, are deferred and\namortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Costs\nrelated to card reward programs are recognized when the rewards\nare earned by the cardholders. Payments to partners are\nrecognized when incurred. Credit card and bank card income is\nearned primarily by USPB and Services . See Note 3 for segment\nresults. Deposit-related fees consist of service charges on\ndeposit accounts and fees earned from performing cash management\nactivities and other deposit account services. Such fees are\nrecognized in the period in which the related service is\nprovided. Deposit-related fees are earned primarily by Services\nand USPB . See Note 3 for segment results. Transactional service\nfees primarily consist of fees charged for processing services\nsuch as cash management, global payments, clearing,\ninternational funds transfer and other trade services. Such fees\nare recognized as/when the associated service is satisfied,\nwhich normally occurs at the point in time the service is\nrequested by the customer and provided by Citi. Transactional\nservice fees are earned primarily by Services. See Note 3 for\nsegment results. Insurance distribution revenue consists of\ncommissions earned from third-party insurance companies for\nmarketing and selling insurance policies on behalf of such\nentities. Such commissions are recognized in Commissions and\nfees at the point in time the associated service is fulfilled,\ngenerally when the insurance policy is sold to the policyholder.\nSales of certain insurance products include a portion of\nvariable consideration associated with the underlying product.\nIn these instances, a portion of the revenue associated with the\nsale of the policy is not recognized until the variable\nconsideration becomes fixed and determinable. The Company\nrecognized $ 188million, $ 201million and $ 260million of\nrevenue related to such variable consideration for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These\namounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied in\nprior periods. Insurance distribution revenue is earned\nprimarily by Wealth and Legacy Franchises within All Other.

Citi\neliminated overdraft fees, returned item fees and overdraft\nprotection fees beginning in June 2022. Includes overdraft fees\nof $ 0 million, $ 59million (prior to the elimination of\noverdraft fees in June 2022) and $ 107million for the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(5) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and\nunderwriting loan syndications or related financing activity.\nThis activity is accounted for under ASC 310.\n(6) Commissions and fees include $( 11,367) million, $( 11,008)\nmillion and $( 8,516) million not accounted for under ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers , for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The custody product is composed of numerous\nservices related to the administration, safekeeping and\nreporting for both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The\nservices offered to clients include trade settlement,\nsafekeeping, income collection, corporate action notification,\nrecord-keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management.\nThese services are provided for a wide range of securities,\nincluding but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate\nbonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market\ninstruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative\ninstruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and precious\nmetals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the associated\npromised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the\npoint in time the service is requested by the customer and\nprovided by Citi. Custody fees are earned primarily by Services\n. See Note 3 for segment results. Fiduciary fees consist of\ntrust services and investment management services. As an escrow\nagent, Citi receives, safekeeps, services and manages clients\u2019\nescrowed assets, such as cash, securities, property (including\nintellectual property), contracts or other collateral. Citi\nperforms its escrow agent duties by safekeeping the assets\nduring the specified time period agreed upon by all parties and\ntherefore earns its revenue evenly during the contract duration.\nInvestment management services consist of managing assets on\nbehalf of Citi\u2019s retail and institutional clients. Revenue from\nthese services primarily consists of asset-based fees for\nadvisory accounts, which are based on the market value of the\nclient\u2019s assets and recognized monthly, when the market value is\nfixed. In some instances, the Company contracts with third-party\nadvisors and with third-party custodians. The Company has\ndetermined that it acts as principal in the majority of these\ntransactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to third\nparties gross within Other operating expenses . Fiduciary fees\nare earned primarily by Wealth and Legacy Franchises within All\nOther . See Note 3 for segment results.

INCENTIVE PLANS\nDiscretionary Annual Incentive\nAwards Citigroup grants\nimmediate cash bonus payments\nand various forms of immediate\nand deferred awards as part of\nits discretionary annual\nincentive award program\ninvolving a large segment of\nCitigroup\u2019s employees\nworldwide. Discretionary\nannual incentive awards are\ngenerally awarded in the first\nquarter of the year based on\nthe previous year\u2019s\nperformance. Awards valued at\nless than U.S. $ 75,000(or the\nlocal currency equivalent) are\ngenerally paid entirely in the\nform of an immediate cash\nbonus. Pursuant to Citigroup\npolicy and/or regulatory\nrequirements, certain\nemployees are subject to\nmandatory deferrals of\nincentive pay and generally\nreceive 15%\u2013 60% of their\nawards in the form of deferred\nstock or deferred cash stock\nunits. Discretionary annual\nincentive awards to certain\nemployees in the EU are\nsubject to deferral\nrequirements regardless of the\ntotal award value, with at\nleast 50% of the immediate\nincentive delivered in the\nform of a stock payment award\nsubject to a restriction on\nsale or transfer (generally,\nfor 12months). For deferred\nincentive awards granted in\n2022 and after, Citigroup\nchanged the annual deferred\ncompensation structure from\ngranting deferred cash awards\nfor certain regulated\nemployees to deferred stock\nawards. Certain employees\nlocated in countries that have\nregulations or tax advantages\nfor offering deferred cash or\ndeferred cash stock units\nreceived those types of awards\nas a part of their annual\nincentive compensation rather\nthan deferred stock. Subject\nto certain exceptions\n(principally, for retirement-\neligible employees),\ncontinuous employment within\nCitigroup is required to vest\nin deferred annual incentive\nawards. Post employment\nvesting by retirement-eligible\nemployees and participants who\nmeet other conditions is\ngenerally conditioned upon\ntheir compliance with certain\nrestrictions during the\nremaining vesting period.\nGenerally, the deferred awards\nvest in equal annual\ninstallments over three- or\nfour-yearperiods. Vested stock\nawards are delivered in shares\nof common stock. Deferred cash\nawards are payable in cash\nand, except as prohibited by\napplicable regulatory\nguidance, earn a fixed\nnotional rate of interest that\nis paid only if and when the\nunderlying principal award\namount vests. Deferred cash\nstock unit awards are payable\nin cash at the vesting value\nof the underlying stock. The\nvalue of each deferred stock\nunit is equal to one share of\nCitigroup stock, and the award\nwill fluctuate with changes in\nthe stock price. Recipients of\ndeferred stock awards and\ndeferred cash stock unit\nawards, however, may, except\nas prohibited by applicable\nregulatory guidance, be\nentitled to receive or accrue\ndividend-equivalent payments\nduring the vesting period.\nGenerally, in the EU, vested\nshares are subject to a\nrestriction on sale or\ntransfer after vesting, and\nvested deferred cash awards\nand deferred cash stock units\nare subject to hold back\n(generally, for 6or 12months\nbased on the award type).\nStock awards, deferred cash\nstock units and deferred cash\nawards are subject to one or\nmore cancellation and clawback\nprovisions that apply in\ncertain circumstances,\nincluding gross misconduct.\n\nOutstanding (Unvested) Stock\nAwards\nA summary of the status of unvested stock awards granted as\ndiscretionary annual incentive or sign-on and replacement stock\nawards is presented below:\n                                                                \n                                                     Weighted-  \n                                                 average\u00a0grant  \n                                                     date\u00a0fair  \n  Unvested\u00a0stock\u00a0awards           Shares       value per share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unvested at December\u00a0       41,908,207    $            65.23  \n  31, 2022                                                      \n  Granted(1)                  37,029,558                 49.36  \n  Canceled                    -2,332,517                 57.00  \n  Vested(2)                  -16,747,915                 63.93  \n  Unvested at December\u00a0       59,857,333    $            56.09  \n  31, 2023                                                      \n                                                                \n(1) The weighted-average fair value of the shares granted during\n2022 and 2021 was $ 65.07and $ 62.10, respectively.\n(2) The weighted-average fair value of the shares vesting during\n2023 was approximately $ 49.86per share on the vesting date,\ncompared to $ 63.93on the grant date.\nCitigroup did not capitalize\nany stock-based compensation\ncosts in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe related income tax\nbenefits for stock-based\ncompensation costs were $\n392million, $ 350million and $\n335million for 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. Total\nunrecognized compensation cost\nrelated to unvested stock\nawards was $ 1billion at\nDecember 31, 2023. The cost is\nexpected to be recognized over\na weighted-average period of\n1.7years. Performance Share\nUnits Certain senior\nexecutives were awarded\nperformance share units (PSUs)\nevery February from 2020 to\n2023, for performance in the\nyear prior to the award date\nbased on two performance\nmetrics. For PSUs awarded in\n2020, those metrics were\nreturn on average tangible\ncommon equity and earnings per\nshare. For PSU awards in 2021,\n2022 and 2023, the metrics\nwere average return on\ntangible common equity and\ncumulative tangible book value\nper share. In each year, the\nmetrics were equally weighted.\nFor all award years, if the\ntotal shareholder return is\nnegative over the three-\nyearperformance period,\nexecutives may earn no more\nthan 100% of the target PSUs,\nregardless of the extent to\nwhich Citigroup outperforms\nagainst performance goals\nand/or peer firms. The number\nof PSUs ultimately earned\ncould vary from zero, if\nperformance goals are not met,\nto as much as 150% of target,\nif performance goals are\nmeaningfully exceeded. The\nreported financial metrics\nduring the performance period\nare adjusted to reflect any\nmandatory equitable\nadjustments as required under\nthe applicable award\nagreements for unusual and\nnon-recurring items as\npresented to and approved by\nthe Compensation, Performance\nManagement and Culture (CPC)\nCommittee. For all award\nyears, the value of each PSU\nis equal to the value of\noneshare of Citi common stock.\nDividend equivalents are\nforfeitable, or accrued and\npaid on the number of earned\nPSUs after the end of the\nperformance period.\n                              173                               \nPSUs are subject to variable\naccounting, pursuant to which\nthe associated value of the\naward will fluctuate with\nchanges in Citigroup\u2019s stock\nprice and the attainment of\nthe specified performance\ngoals for each award. The\naward is settled solely in\ncash after the end of each\nperformance period. The value\nof the award, subject to the\nperformance goals and taking\ninto account any mandatory\nequitable adjustments as per\nthe terms of the award\nagreement, is estimated using\na simulation model that\nincorporates multiple\nvaluation assumptions,\nincluding the probability of\nachieving the specified\nperformance goals of each\naward. The risk-free rate used\nin the model is based on the\napplicable U.S. Treasury yield\ncurve.

The awards\nare subject to variable accounting, pursuant to which the\nassociated value of the award will fluctuate with the attainment\nof the performance conditions for each tranche and changes to\nCitigroup\u2019s stock price for the third tranche. Payment for each\nperiod will be in cash, in a lump sum, with the third payment\nindexed to changes in the value of Citi\u2019s common stock from the\nservice inception date through the payment date. Earnings\ngenerally will be based on collective performance with respect\nto Citi\u2019s transformation goals and\n\nwill be evaluated and approved by the CPC Committee on an annual\nbasis. Payments in the event of any category of employment\ntermination or change in job title or employment status are\nsubject to Citi\u2019s discretion. Cancellation and clawback are\nprovided for in the event of misconduct and certain other\ncircumstances. The program applies to senior leaders, other than\nthe CEO, critical to helping deliver a successful transformation\nwith the value of the awards varying based on individual\ncompensation levels. Stock Option Program All outstanding\noptions were fully vested at December 31, 2020 and exercised\nduring 2021, with noneoutstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOther Variable Incentive Compensation Citigroup has various\nincentive plans globally that are used to motivate and reward\nperformance primarily in the areas of sales, operational\nexcellence and customer satisfaction. Participation in these\nplans is generally limited to employees who are not eligible for\ndiscretionary annual incentive awards. Other forms of variable\ncompensation include commissions paid to financial advisors and\nmortgage loan officers. Additional Information Except for awards\nsubject to variable accounting, the total expense recognized for\nstock awards represents the grant date fair value of such\nawards, which is generally recognized as a charge to income\nratably over the vesting period, other than for awards to\nretirement-eligible employees and immediately vested awards.\nWhenever awards are granted or are expected to be granted to\nretirement-eligible employees, the charge to income is\naccelerated based on when the applicable conditions for\nretirement eligibility were or will be met. If the employee is\nretirement eligible on the grant date, or the award is vested at\nthe grant date, Citi recognizes the expense each year equal to\nthe grant date fair value of the awards that it estimates will\nbe granted in the following year. Recipients of Citigroup stock\nawards generally do not have any stockholder rights until shares\nare delivered upon vesting. Recipients of stock-settled awards\nand other vested stock awards subject to a sale-restriction\nperiod are generally entitled to vote the shares in their award\nand receive dividends on such shares during the sale-restriction\nperiod. Once a stock award vests, the shares delivered to the\nparticipant are freely transferable, unless they are subject to\na restriction on sale or transfer for a specified period. All\nequity awards granted since April 19, 2005 have been made\npursuant to stockholder-approved stock incentive plans that are\nadministered by the CPC Committee (or its predecessor), which is\ncomposed entirely of independent non-employee directors. On\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 41.7million shares of Citigroup\ncommon stock were authorized and available for grant under\nCitigroup\u2019s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the only plan from which\nequity awards are currently granted.\n                              174                               \nThe 2019 Stock Incentive Plan\nand predecessor plans permit\nthe use of treasury stock or\nnewly issued shares in\nconnection with awards granted\nunder the plans. Treasury\nshares were used to settle\nvestings from 2018 to 2022,\nand for the first quarter of\n2023, except where local laws\nfavor newly issued shares. The\nuse of treasury stock or newly\nissued shares to settle stock\nawards does not affect the\ncompensation expense recorded\nin the Consolidated Statement\nof Income for equity awards.\nIncentive Compensation Cost\nThe following table presents\ncomponents of compensation\nexpense, relating to the\nincentive compensation\nprograms described above:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0dollars          2023        2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Charges for estimated                                         \n  awards to                   $    663    $    742    $    807  \n  retirement-eligible                                           \n  employees                                                     \n  Amortization of deferred                                      \n  cash awards,                                                  \n  deferred cash stock              340         463         384  \n  units and                                                     \n  performance stock units                                       \n  Immediately vested stock                                      \n  award                            127         101          99  \n  expense(1)                                                    \n  Amortization of                                               \n  restricted and deferred          689         533         395  \n  stock awards(2)                                               \n  Other variable incentive         286         304         435  \n  compensation                                                  \n  Total(3)                    $  2,105    $  2,143    $  2,091  \n                                                                \n(1) Represents expense for\nimmediately vested stock\nawards that generally were\nstock payments in lieu of cash\ncompensation.

Accordingly, no additional\ncompensation-based contributions have been credited to the cash\nbalance portion of the plan for existing plan participants after\n2007. However, certain employees covered under the prior final\npay plan formula continue to accrue benefits. The Company also\noffers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to\ncertain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain\neligible employees outside the U.S. The Company also sponsors a\nnumber of non-contributory, nonqualified pension plans. These\nplans, which are unfunded, provide supplemental defined pension\nbenefits to certain U.S. employees. With the exception of\ncertain\n\nemployees covered under the prior final pay plan formula, the\nbenefits under these plans were frozen in prior years. The plan\nobligations, plan assets and periodic plan expense for the\nCompany\u2019s most significant pension and postretirement benefit\nplans (Significant Plans) are measured and disclosed quarterly,\ninstead of annually.

Changes in one or a\ncombination of these assumptions will have an impact on the\nCompany\u2019s pension and postretirement PBO, funded status and\n(benefit) expense. Changes in the plans\u2019 funded status resulting\nfrom changes in the PBO and fair value of plan assets will have\na corresponding impact on Accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) . The actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended\nDecember 31 in the table below are used to measure the year-end\nPBO and the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent\nyear (period). Since Citi\u2019s Significant Plans are measured on a\nquarterly basis, the year-end rates for those plans are used to\ncalculate the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent\nyear\u2019s first quarter. As a result of the quarterly measurement\nprocess, the net periodic (benefit) expense for the Significant\nPlans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the\npreceding quarter-end rates (as presented below for the U.S. and\nnon-U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans). The\nactuarial assumptions for All Other Plans are measured annually.\n                              178                               \nCertain assumptions used in\ndetermining pension and\npostretirement benefit\nobligations and net benefit\nexpense for the Company\u2019s\nplans are presented in the\nfollowing table:\n                                                                \n  At\u00a0year\u00a0end                              2023           2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Discount rate                                                 \n  U.S. plans                                                    \n  Qualified pension                       5.10%          5.50%  \n  Nonqualified pension                     5.15           5.55  \n  Postretirement benefit plan              5.20           5.60  \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range                             1.35to14.55    1.75to25.20  \n  Weighted average                         6.91           6.66  \n  Non-U.S. postretirement                                       \n  benefit plans                                                 \n  Range                             3.80to10.70    3.25to10.60  \n  Weighted average                         9.90           9.80  \n  Future compensation increase                                  \n  rate(1)                                                       \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range                             1.30to12.40    1.30to23.11  \n  Weighted average                         3.84           3.76  \n  Long-term expected return on                                  \n  assets                                                        \n  U.S. plans                                                    \n  Qualified pension                        5.70           5.70  \n  Postretirement benefit plan(2)      5.70/3.00      5.70/3.00  \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range                             2.00to11.50    1.00to11.50  \n  Weighted average                         6.62           6.05  \n  Non-U.S. postretirement                                       \n  benefit plans                                                 \n  Range                              8.60to9.40     8.70to9.10  \n  Weighted average                         9.39           8.70  \n  Interest crediting rate                                       \n  (weighted                                                     \n  average)(3)                                                   \n  U.S. plans                               4.10           4.50  \n  Non-U.S. plans                           1.78           1.73  \n                                                                \n(1) Not material for U.S.\nplans.

(3) Not\nmaterial for U.S. plans. (4)\nEffective January 1, 2024,\nthere is no change in the\nexpected return on assets for\nthe U.S. pension and\npostretirement benefit plans\nof 5.70%. The expected return\non assets for the U.S. pension\nand postretirement benefit\nplans was adjusted from 5.00%\nto 5.70% effective January 1,\n2023 to reflect a significant\nchange in economic market\nconditions. The expected\nreturn on assets for the U.S.\npension and postretirement\nbenefit plans changed from\n6.70% to 5.80% effec tive J\nanuary 1, 2021, reduced to\n5.60% effective April 1, 2021\nand further reduced to 5.00%\neffective October 1, 2021. For\nthe year 2023, the expected\nreturn on assets for the VEBA\nTrust was 3.00% and for 2021\nand 2022 it was 1.50%.\n                              179                               \n(5) The Company has cash balance plans and other plans with\npromised interest crediting rates. For these plans, the interest\ncrediting rates are set in line with plan rules or country\nlegislation . Discount Rate The discount rates for the U.S.\npension and postretirement benefit plans were selected by\nreference to a Citigroup-specific analysis using each plan\u2019s\nspecific cash flows and a hypothetical bond portfolio of U.S.\nhigh-quality corporate bonds that match each plan\u2019s projected\ncash flows. The discount rates for the non-U.S. pension and\npostretirement benefit plans are selected by reference to each\nplan\u2019s specific cash flows and a market-based yield curve\ndeveloped from the available local high-quality corporate bonds.\nHowever, where developed corporate bond markets do not exist,\nthe discount rates are selected by reference to local government\nbonds with an estimated premium added to reflect the additional\nrisk for corporate bonds in certain countries. Where available,\nthe resulting plan yields by jurisdiction are compared with\npublished, high-quality corporate bond indices for\nreasonableness. Expected Return on Assets The Company determines\nits assumptions for the expected return on assets for its U.S.\npension and postretirement benefit plans using a \u201cbuilding\nblock\u201d approach, which focuses on ranges of anticipated rates of\nreturn for each asset class. A weighted-average range of nominal\nrates is then determined based on target allocations to each\nasset class. Market performance over a number of earlier years\nis evaluated covering a wide range of economic conditions to\ndetermine whether there are sound reasons for projecting any\npast trends. The Company considers the expected return on assets\nto be a long-term assessment of return expectations and does not\nanticipate changing this assumption unless there are significant\nchanges in investment strategy or economic conditions. This\ncontrasts with the selection of the discount rate and certain\nother assumptions, which are reconsidered annually (or quarterly\nfor the Significant Plans) in accordance with GAAP. The expected\nreturn on assets reflects the expected annual appreciation of\nthe plan assets and reduces the Company\u2019s annual pension\nexpense. The expected return on assets is deducted from the sum\nof service cost, interest cost and other components of pension\nexpense to arrive at the net pension (benefit) expense.\nThe following table presents\nthe expected return on assets\nused in determining the\nCompany\u2019s pension expense\ncompared to the actual return\non assets during 2023, 2022\nand 2021 for the U.S. pension\nand postretirement benefit\nplans:\n                                                                \n  U.S. plans(during      2023      2022                   2021  \n  the year)                                                     \n  Expected return on                                            \n  assets                                                        \n  U.S. pension and                                              \n  postretirement        5.70%     5.00%    5.80%/5.60%/5.60%/\u2026  \n  trust                                                         \n  VEBA Trust(1)          3.00      1.50                   1.50  \n  Actual return on                                              \n  assets(2)                                                     \n  U.S. pension and                                              \n  postretirement         9.83    -15.52                   5.14  \n  trust                                                         \n  VEBA Trust             5.87      1.40                   1.52  \n                                                                \n(1) The expected return on\nassets for the VEBA Trust was\nadjusted from 1.50% to 3.00%\neffective January 1, 2023 to\nreflect the significant change\nin economic conditions.\n(2) Actual return on assets is\npresented net of fees.\nSensitivities of Certain Key\nAssumptions The U.S. Qualified\nPension Plan was frozen in\n2008, and as a result, most of\nthe prospective service costs\nhave been eliminated and the\ngain/loss amortization period\nwas changed to the life\nexpectancy for inactive\nparticipants. As a result,\npension expense for the U.S.\nQualified Pension Plan is\ndriven more by interest cost\nthan service cost, and an\nincrease in the discount rate\nwould increase pension\nexpense, while a decrease in\nthe discount rate would\ndecrease pension expense. For\nNon-U.S. Pension Plans that\nare not frozen (in countries\nsuch as Mexico, the U.K. and\nSouth Korea), there is more\nservice cost. The pension\nexpense for the Non-U.S. Plans\nis driven by both service cost\nand interest cost. An increase\nin the discount rate generally\ndecreases pension expense due\nto the greater impact on\nservice cost compared to\ninterest cost.\nThe following tables summarize\nthe effect on pension

the\nreal estate category and not private equity.\n\n(2) Equity securities in the U.S. pension and postretirement\nbenefit plans do not include any Citigroup common stock at the\nend of 2023 and

pension and\npostretirement funds\u2019\ninvestment strategy is to\ninvest in a prudent manner for\nthe exclusive purpose of\nproviding benefits to\nparticipants. The investment\nstrategies are targeted to\nproduce a total return that,\nwhen combined with the\nCompany\u2019s contributions to the\nfunds, will maintain the\nfunds\u2019 ability to meet all\nrequired benefit obligations.\nRisk is controlled through\ndiversification of asset types\nand investments in domestic\nand international equities,\nfixed income securities and\ncash and short-term\ninvestments. The target asset\nallocation in most locations\noutside the U.S. is primarily\nin equity and debt securities.\nThese allocations may vary by\ngeographic region and country\ndepending on the nature of\napplicable obligations and\nvarious other regional\nconsiderations. The wide\nvariation in the actual range\nof plan asset allocations for\nthe funded non-U.S. plans is a\nresult of differing local\nstatutory requirements and\neconomic conditions. For\nexample, in certain countries\nlocal law requires that all\npension plan assets must be\ninvested in fixed income\ninvestments, government funds\nor local-country securities.\nSignificant Concentrations of\nRisk in Plan Assets The assets\nof the Company\u2019s pension plans\nare diversified to limit the\nimpact of any individual\ninvestment.

2023, Citi was under audit by the Internal\nRevenue Service and other major taxing jurisdictions around the\nworld. It is thus reasonably possible that significant changes\nin the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur\nwithin the next 12 months. The potential range of amounts that\ncould affect Citi\u2019s effective tax rate is between $ 0and $\n500million.\nThe following are the major\ntax jurisdictions in which the\nCompany and its affiliates\noperate and the earliest tax\nyear subject to examination:\n                                             \n  Jurisdiction               Tax\u00a0year        \n  United States                        2016  \n  Mexico                               2017  \n  New York State and City              2009  \n  United Kingdom                       2016  \n  India                                2021  \n  Singapore                            2022  \n  Hong Kong                            2023  \n  Ireland                              2018  \n                                             \n                              189                               \nNon-U.S. Earnings Non-U.S. pretax earnings approximated $\n19.4billion in 2023, $ 16.2billion in 2022 and $ 12.9billion in\n2021. As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries\nare currently subject to U.S. taxation on all non-U.S. pretax\nearnings of non-U.S. branches. Beginning in 2018, there is a\nseparate foreign tax credit (FTC) basket for branches. Also,\ndividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary or affiliate are\neffectively exempt from U.S. taxation. The Company provides\nincome taxes on the book over tax basis differences of non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries except to the extent that such differences are\nindefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At December 31, 2023, $\n6.0billion of basis differences of non-U.S. entities was\nindefinitely reinvested. At the existing tax rates (including\nwithholding taxes), additional taxes (net of U.S. FTCs) of $\n2.3billion would have to be provided if such assertions were\nreversed. Deferred Tax Assets As of December 31, 2023, Citi had\na valuation allowance of $ 3.6billion, composed of valuation\nallowances of $ 1.9billion on its branch basket FTC carry-\nforwards, $ 1.2billion on its U.S. residual DTA related to its\nnon-U.S. branches, $ 0.4billion on local non-U.S. DTAs and $\n0.1billion on state net operating loss carry-forwards. There was\nan increase of $ 1.2billion from the December 31, 2022 balance\nof $ 2.4billion. The amount of Citi\u2019s valuation allowances (VA)\nmay change in future years. In 2023, Citi\u2019s VA for carry-forward\nFTCs in its branch basket increased by $ 1.0billion, primarily\ndue to lower ODL usage. The level of branch pretax income, the\nlocal branch tax rate and the allocations of overall domestic\nlosses (ODL) and expenses for U.S. tax purposes to the branch\nbasket are the main factors in determining the branch VA. There\nwas no branch basket VA release in 2023. The non-U.S. local VA\nwas unchanged.\nThe following table summarizes\nCiti\u2019s DTAs:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0billions\u00a0of\u00a0

    \n(1) Before valuation\nallowance. (2) Pretax.\nAlthough realization is not assured, Citi believes that the\nrealization of the recognized net DTAs of $ 29.6billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 is more-likely-than-not, based on expectations\nas to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise and consideration of available tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC 740, Income Taxes ). The majority\nof Citi\u2019s U.S. federal net operating loss carry-forward and all\nof its New York State and City net operating loss carry-forwards\nare subject to a carry-forward period of 20years. This provides\nenough time to fully utilize the DTAs pertaining to these\nexisting NOL carry-forwards. This is due to Citi\u2019s forecast of\nsufficient U.S. taxable income and because New York State and\nCity continue to tax Citi\u2019s non-U.S. income. With respect to the\nFTCs component of the DTAs, the carry-forward period is 10years.\nUtilization of FTCs in any year is generally limited to 21% of\nforeign source taxable income in that year. However, ODL that\nCiti has incurred of approximately $ 7billion as of December 31,\n2023 are allowed to be reclassified as foreign source income to\nthe extent of 50%\u2013 100% (at taxpayer\u2019s election) of domestic\nsource income produced in subsequent years. Such resulting\nforeign source income would help support the realization of the\nFTC carry-forwards after VA. As noted in the tables above,\nCiti\u2019s FTC carry-forwards were $ 1.2billion ($ 3.1billion before\nVA) as of December 31, 2023, compared to $ 1.9billion ($\n2.8billion before VA) as of December 31, 2022. The increased VA\non branch FTCs is reflected in the \u201cNon-U.S. income tax rate\ndifferential\u201d line in the \u201cTax Rate\u201d section above. Citi\nbelieves that it will more-likely-than-not generate sufficient\nU.S. taxable income within the 10-year carry-forward period to\nbe able to utilize the net FTCs after the VA, after considering\nany FTCs produced in the tax return for such period, which must\nbe used prior to any carry-forward utilization.\n                              191                               \n                                                                \n  11.

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 16.\nThe resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized\nfinancing transactions. Citi executes these transactions\nprimarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to facilitate\ncustomer matched-book activity and to efficiently fund a portion\nof Citi\u2019s trading inventory. Transactions executed by Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing\nactivity.\n\nTo maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market\nconditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages\nthese activities by taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor. Citi\nmanages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions\nby conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in\ncapacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client\nactions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty\ndiversification by establishing concentration triggers and\nassessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.\n\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary,\n\nrequire prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to\nmaintain contractual margin protection. For resale and\nrepurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts\nadditional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin\nprotection. Collateral typically consists of government and\ngovernment-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds,\nequities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. The\nresale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother type of default under the relevant master agreement.\nEvents of default generally include (i) failure to deliver cash\nor securities as required under the transaction, (ii) failure to\nprovide or return cash or securities as used for margining\npurposes, (iii) breach of representation, (iv) cross-default to\nanother transaction entered into among the parties, or, in some\ncases, their affiliates, and (v) a repudiation of obligations\nunder the agreement. The counterparty that receives the\nsecurities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in\nits use of the securities, with the exception of transactions\nexecuted on a tri-party basis, where the collateral is\nmaintained by a custodian and operational limitations may\nrestrict its use of the securities. A substantial portion of the\nresale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as\nthe Company elected the fair value option, as described in Notes\n26 and 27. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of\ncash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as\nspecified in the respective agreements. The securities borrowing\nand lending agreements also represent collateralized financing\ntransactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements.\nCollateral typically consists of government and government-\nagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities.\nSimilar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities\nborrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother default by the other party under the relevant master\nagreement. Events of default and rights to use securities under\nthe securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to\nthe resale and repurchase agreements referenced above. A\nsubstantial portion of securities borrowing and lending\nagreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 27. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection.\n                              193                               \nThe enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the\nmaster netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements,\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements, is evidenced to\nthe extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion has been obtained\nfrom counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding the enforceability of these\nagreements and (ii) the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting\nparty to terminate and close out transactions on a net basis\nunder these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under\napplicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or similar proceeding. A legal opinion may not have\nbeen sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local\nlaw is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the\nenforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or\nconflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of\nsuch rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may\nbe nonexistent or unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For\nexample, this may be the case for certain sovereigns,\nmunicipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. The\nfollowing tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements and\nthe related offsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45.\nThe tables also include amounts related to financial instruments\nthat are not permitted to be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but\nwould be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained.\nRemaining exposures continue to be secured by financial\ncollateral, but the Company may not have sought or been able to\nobtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the\noffsetting right.\n                                                                \n

BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND\nBROKERAGE PAYABLES\n\nThe Company has receivables\nand payables for financial\ninstruments sold to and\npurchased from brokers,\ndealers and customers, which\narise in the ordinary course\nof business. Citi is exposed\nto risk of loss from the\ninability of brokers, dealers\nor customers to pay for\npurchases or to deliver the\nfinancial instruments sold, in\nwhich case Citi would have to\nsell or purchase the financial\ninstruments at prevailing\nmarket prices. Credit risk is\nreduced to the extent that an\nexchange or clearing\norganization acts as a\ncounterparty to the\ntransaction and replaces the\nbroker, dealer or customer in\nquestion.\n\nCiti seeks to protect itself\nfrom the risks associated with\ncustomer activities by\nrequiring customers to\nmaintain margin collateral in\ncompliance with regulatory and\ninternal guidelines. Margin\nlevels are monitored daily,\nand customers deposit\nadditional collateral as\nrequired. Where customers\ncannot meet collateral\nrequirements, Citi may\nliquidate sufficient\nunderlying financial\ninstruments to bring the\ncustomer into compliance with\nthe required margin level.\n\nExposure to credit risk is\nimpacted by market volatility,\nwhich may impair the ability\nof clients to satisfy their\nobligations to Citi. Credit\nlimits are established and\nclosely monitored for\ncustomers and for brokers and\ndealers engaged in forwards,\nfutures and other transactions\ndeemed to be credit sensitive.\nBrokerage receivables and\nBrokerage payables consisted\nof the following:\n                                                                \n                                     December 31,               \n  In millions of dollars                     2023         2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Receivables from customers      $        15,986    $  15,462  \n  Receivables from brokers,                                     \n  dealers and                              37,929       38,730  \n  clearing organizations                                        \n  Total brokerage                 $        53,915    $  54,192  \n  receivables(1)                                                \n  Payables to customers           $        49,206    $  55,747  \n  Payables to brokers, dealers                                  \n  and                                      14,333       13,471  \n  clearing organizations                                        \n  Total brokerage payables(1)     $        63,539    $  69,218  \n                                                                \n(1) Includes brokerage\nreceivables and payables\nrecorded by Citi broker-dealer\nentities that are accounted\nfor in accordance with the\nAICPA Accounting Guide for\nBrokers and Dealers in\nSecurities as codified in ASC\n940-320.\n                              196                               \n                                                                \n              This page intentionally left blank.               \n                                                                \n                              197                               \n                                                                \n  14.

At the time of transfer, the securities were in an\nunrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion, which was recorded in\nAOCI upon transfer . See Note 1.\nThe Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these\nsecurities to maturity or, where applicable, until the exercise\nof any issuer call option, absent any unforeseen significant\nchanges in circumstances, including deterioration in credit or\nchanges in regulatory capital requirements. The net unrealized\nlosses classified in AOCI for HTM debt securities primarily\nrelate to debt securities previously classified as AFS that were\ntransferred to HTM, and include any cumulative fair value hedge\nadjustments. The net unrealized loss amount also includes any\nnon-credit-related changes in fair value of HTM debt securities\nthat have suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings.

There were no purchased credit-deteriorated HTM debt\nsecurities held by the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n                              203                               \nEvaluating Investments for Impairment\u2014AFS Debt Securities\nOverview The Company conducts periodic reviews of all AFS debt\nsecurities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the\nimpairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other\nfactors and to evaluate the Company\u2019s intent to sell such\nsecurities. An AFS debt security is impaired when the current\nfair value of an individual AFS debt security is less than its\namortized cost basis. The Company recognizes the entire\ndifference between amortized cost basis and fair value in\nearnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has an\nintent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized\ncost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities that the\nCompany does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required\nto sell, only the credit-related impairment is recognized in\nearnings by recording an allowance for credit losses. Any\nremaining fair value decline for such securities is recorded in\nAOCI . The Company does not consider the length of time that the\nfair value of a security is below its amortized cost when\ndetermining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt securities,\ncredit losses exist where Citi does not expect to receive\ncontractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to\nrecover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under business policies. The sections\nbelow describe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected\ncredit impairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of December 31, 2023. Agency\nMortgage-Backed Securities Citi records no allowances for credit\nlosses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities, because the Company expects to incur no credit\nlosses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no\ncredit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties. State\nand Municipal Securities The process for estimating credit\nlosses in Citigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily\nbased on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit\nratings. Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers\nproviding default protection in the form of financial guarantee\ninsurance. The average external credit rating, disregarding any\ninsurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating\ndowngrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based\non instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of\nissuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for\nadverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of\nvalue, the full impairment is recognized in earnings. For AFS\nstate and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to sell and\nit is not more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required\nto sell, Citi records an allowance for expected credit losses\nfor the amount it expects not to collect, capped at the\ndifference between the bond\u2019s amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue. Equity Method Investments Management assesses equity\nmethod investments that have fair values that are less than\ntheir respective carrying values for other-than-temporary\nimpairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured as price multiplied by\nquantity if the investee has publicly listed securities. If the\ninvestee is not publicly listed, other methods are used (see\nNote 26). For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans\nto sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not\nbe required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value\nwill recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether\nthe impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the cause of the impairment and the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,\nincluding any specific events that may influence the operations\nof the issuer; \u2022 the intent and ability to hold the investment\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in market value; and \u2022 the length of time and extent to\nwhich fair value has been less than the carrying value.\n                              204                               \nRecognition and Measurement of Impairment\nThe following table presents total impairment on AFS investments\nrecognized in earnings:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                         Year ended             \n  dollars                     2023             2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impairment losses                                             \n  recognized in                                                 \n  earnings                                                      \n  for debt securities                                           \n  that the Company                                              \n  intends to sell,                                              \n  would                    $   188    $         360    $   181  \n  more-likely-than-not                                          \n  be required to sell                                           \n  or will be subject to                                         \n  an issuer call                                                \n  deemed probable of                                            \n  exercise                                                      \n                                                                \nAllowance for Credit Losses on AFS Debt Securities The allowance\nfor credit losses on AFS debt securities held that the Company\ndoes not intend to sell nor will likely be required to sell was\n$ 8million and $ 3million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n                              205                               \nNon-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at Fair Value Non-\nmarketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the\ninvestment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan\nBank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried\nat cost. The election to measure a non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement alternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus\nchanges resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair\nvalue on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may\ndiffer from the observed transaction price due to a number of\nfactors, including marketability adjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for\nthe identical investment held by Citi. Equity securities under\nthe measurement alternative are also assessed for impairment. On\na quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether\neach equity security under the measurement alternative is\nimpaired. Impairment indicators that are considered include, but\nare not limited to, the following: \u2022 a significant deterioration\nin the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or\nbusiness prospects of the investee; \u2022 a significant adverse\nchange in the regulatory, economic or technological environment\nof the investee; \u2022 a significant adverse change in the general\nmarket condition of either the geographical area or the industry\nin which the investee operates; \u2022 a bona fide offer to purchase,\nan offer by the investee to sell or a completed auction process\nfor the same or similar investment for an amount less than the\ncarrying amount of that investment; and \u2022 factors that raise\nsignificant concerns about the investee\u2019s ability to continue as\na going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations,\nworking capital deficiencies or noncompliance with statutory\ncapital requirements or debt covenants. When the qualitative\nassessment indicates that the equity security is impaired, its\nfair value is determined. If the fair value of the investment is\nless than its carrying value, the investment is written down to\nfair value through earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\n                                                                \n  In millions of           December 31,           December 31,  \n  dollars                          2023                   2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value     $            1,639    $             1,676  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized\nin earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable\nequity securities measured\nusing the measurement\nalternative:\n                                                                \n                                Year ended December             \n  In millions of                                31,             \n  dollars                                      2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative(1):                                               \n  Impairment losses       $                     135    $   139  \n  Downward changes for                           24          3  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                             87        177  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 26 for additional\ninformation on these\nnonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                     December 31, 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                          338  \n  Downward changes for                                      34  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       951  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

The Company sold and/or reclassified to held-for-\nsale $ 5.7billion and $ 5.0billion of corporate loans during the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nCompany did not have significant purchases of corporate loans\nclassified as held-for-investment for the years ended December\n31, 2023 or 2022. Lease Financing Citi is a lessor in the power,\nrailcars, shipping and aircraft sectors, where the Company has\nexecuted operating, direct financing and leveraged leases.\nCiti\u2019s $ 0.3billion of lease financing receivables, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, is composed of approximately equal balances\nof direct financing lease receivables and net investments in\nleveraged leases. Citi uses the interest rate implicit in the\nlease to determine the present value of its lease financing\nreceivables. Interest income on direct financing and leveraged\nleases during the year ended December 31, 2023 was not material.\nThe Company\u2019s operating leases, where Citi is a lessor, are not\nsignificant to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDelinquency Status Citi generally does not manage corporate\nloans on a delinquency basis. Corporate loans are placed on a\ncash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual\nexperience and a forward-looking assessment of the\ncollectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of interest\nor principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is 90days\npast due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the\nprocess of collection. Any interest accrued on impaired\ncorporate loans and leases is reversed at 90days and charged\nagainst current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in\nearnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When\nthere is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of\nprincipal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce\nthe recorded investment in the loan. While corporate loans are\ngenerally managed based on their internally assigned risk rating\n(see further discussion below), the following tables present\ndelinquency information by corporate loan

As part of its risk management process, Citi assigns\nnumeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on\nquantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and\nfacility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or\nmore often if material events related to the obligor or facility\nwarrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk ratings\ninclude financial condition of the obligor, qualitative\nassessment of management and strategy, amount and sources of\nrepayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee\narrangements, amount and type of any contingencies associated\nwith the obligor and the obligor\u2019s industry and geography. The\nobligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default\nprobabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges\nof loss norms, which are the product of the probability of\ndefault and the loss given default. The investment-grade rating\ncategories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as\ndefined by S&P and Moody\u2019s. Loans classified according to the\nbank regulatory definitions as special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful and loss will have risk ratings within the non-\ninvestment-grade categories.\n

Delinquency Status Delinquency\nstatus is monitored and considered a key indicator of credit\nquality of consumer loans. Principally, the U.S. residential\nfirst mortgage loans use the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)\nmethod of reporting delinquencies, which considers a loan\ndelinquent if a monthly payment has not been received by the end\nof the day immediately preceding the loan\u2019s next due date. All\nother loans use a method of reporting delinquencies that\nconsiders a loan delinquent if a monthly payment has not been\nreceived by the close of business on the loan\u2019s next due date.\nAs a general policy, residential first mortgages, home equity\nloans and installment loans are classified as non-accrual when\nloan payments are 90days contractually past due. Credit cards\nand unsecured revolving loans generally accrue interest until\npayments are 180days past due. Home equity loans in regulated\nbank entities are classified as non-accrual if the related\nresidential first mortgage is 90days or more past due. Mortgage\nloans, other than Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\u2013insured\nloans, are classified as non-accrual within 60days of\nnotification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. The\npolicy for re-aging modified U.S. consumer loans to current\nstatus varies by product. Generally, one of the conditions to\nqualify for these modifications is that a minimum number of\npayments (typically ranging from oneto three) be made. Upon\nmodification, the loan is re-aged to current status. However,\nre-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer loans, such\nas credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer\nloans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for a\nloan to be re-aged to current status is that at least\nthreeconsecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent\namount, must be received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines,\nthe number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject\nto limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five\nyears). Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\nloans are modified under those respective agencies\u2019 guidelines\nand payments are not always required in order to re-age a\nmodified loan to current. The tables below present details about\nthese loans, including the following loan categories: \u2022\nResidential first mortgages and Home equity loans primarily\nrepresent secured mortgage lending to customers of Retail\nBanking and Wealth . \u2022 Credit cards primarily represent\nunsecured credit card lending to customers of Branded Cards and\nRetail Services. \u2022 Personal, small business and other loans are\nprimarily composed of classifiably managed loans to customers of\nWealth (mainly within the Private Bank) who are typically high\ncredit quality borrowers that historically experienced minimal\ndelinquencies and credit losses. Loans to these borrowers are\ngenerally well collateralized in the form of liquid securities\nand other forms of collateral.\n                              213                               \nThe following tables provide Citi\u2019s consumer loans by type:\nConsumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at December\n31, 2023\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nConsumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at December\n31, 2022\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(2) Includes $ 313million and $ 237million at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, of residential first mortgages recorded\nat fair value.\n(3) Excludes loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored\nagencies.

These scores are\ncontinually updated by the agencies based on an individual\u2019s\ncredit actions (e.g., taking out a loan or missed or late\npayments). The following tables provide details on the FICO\nscores for Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-\nperiod receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are\nupdated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or,\notherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio.\nLoans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have\nbeen updated with FICO scores as they become available. With\nrespect to Citi\u2019s consumer loan portfolio outside of the U.S. as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022 ($ 77.5billion and $ 80.5billion,\nrespectively), various country-specific or regional credit risk\nmetrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are\nleveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality\nof customers (see \u201cConsumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North\nAmerica\u201d below).

Citi uses various\nmetrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the\ntime of modification. Citi\u2019s significant consumer modification\nprograms are described below. Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist\ncredit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty\nby offering long-term loan modification programs. These\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan\nnot to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer\u2019s available\nline of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card\nborrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nseek to restructure customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In both\ncircumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nstandard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may\nforgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays\na required amount. Residential Mortgages Citi utilizes a third-\nparty subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage\nloans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to\nassist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate\nreductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term\nextensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in\nforbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the\nend of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently\nmodifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi\nenters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a three-monthperiod during\nwhich the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated\nmodified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue\ninterest in accordance with their original contractual terms.\nUpon successful completion of the trial period, and the\nborrower\u2019s formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the\nborrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the\nmajority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be\nenrolled in a permanent modification. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, $ 21million of mortgage loans were enrolled\nin trial programs. Mortgage loans of $ 7million had gone through\nChapter 7 bankruptcy during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n                              221                               \nTypes of Consumer Loan Modifications and Their Financial Effect\nThe following table provides details on permanent consumer loan\nmodifications granted during the year ended December 31, 2023 to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of\nmodification granted and the financial effect of those\nmodifications:\n                                                                \n                                             \u2026             \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026    \n                                             %      \u2026      \u2026    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                             1                  \n                                             2                  \n                                             \u2026      \u2014      \u2014    \n                                             6             \u2014    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                             2                  \n                                             \u2026             \u2014    \n                                             7             \u2014    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as\nof the end of the reporting period.

Prior-period amounts have been\nrevised to conform with the current presentation. See Note 3.\n(2) Represents goodwill allocated to the Asia Consumer banking\nexit markets upon the signing of the respective sales\nagreements: in 2021, related to the Australia and Philippines\nconsumer banking businesses, which were reclassified as HFS\nduring 2021; in 2022, related to the India, Taiwan, Thailand,\nMalaysia, Indonesia, Bahrain and Vietnam consumer banking\nbusinesses, which were reclassified as HFS during 2022. See Note\n2.\n(3) Goodwill impairment of $ 535million (approximately $\n489million after-tax) was incurred in the Asia Consumer\nreporting unit of Legacy Franchises in the first quarter of\n2022, due to the resegmentation and change of reporting units as\nwell as the sequence of the signing of sale agreements.\nCiti performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October\n1, 2023, which resulted in no impairment of any of Citi\u2019s\nreporting units\u2019 goodwill. As discussed in Note 3, effective in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023, as part of its organizational\nsimplification, Citi made changes to its management structure,\nwhich resulted in changes in its operating segments and\nreporting units to reflect how the CEO, who is the chief\noperating decision maker, manages the Company, including\nallocating resources and measuring performance. The\nreorganization of Citi\u2019s segment structure, including the change\nof management, and the business realignment between Banking and\nMarkets were identified as triggering events for purposes of\ngoodwill impairment testing. Consistent with the requirements of\nASC 350, additional interim goodwill impairment tests were\nperformed as of December 13, 2023, which resulted in no\nimpairment during the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally,\ngoodwill was reallocated from Banking to Markets related to the\nbusiness realignment based on their relative fair values using\nthe valuation performed as of the effective date of the\nreorganization. No additional triggering events were identified\nand no goodwill was impaired during 2023. While the inherent\nrisk of uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in\nthe reporting unit valuations, the economic and business\nenvironments continue to evolve as management implements its\norganizational simplification. If management\u2019s future estimates\nof key economic and market assumptions were to differ from its\ncurrent assumptions, Citi could potentially experience material\ngoodwill impairment charges in the future.

SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n\nUses of Special Purpose Entities A special purpose entity (SPE)\nis an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the\ncompany that organized it. The principal uses of SPEs by Citi\nare to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and\ncreate investment products for clients and to obtain liquidity\nand optimize capital efficiency by securitizing certain of\nCiti\u2019s financial assets. SPEs may be organized in various legal\nforms, including trusts, partnerships or corporations. In a\nsecuritization, through the SPE\u2019s issuance of debt and equity\ninstruments, certificates, commercial paper or other notes of\nindebtedness, the company transferring assets to the SPE\nconverts all (or a portion) of those assets into cash before\nthey would have been realized in the normal course of business.\nThese issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the SPE,\nwhich may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of\nthe company that organized the SPE. Investors usually have\nrecourse only to the assets in the SPE, but may also benefit\nfrom other credit enhancements, such as a collateral account, a\nline of credit or a liquidity facility, such as a liquidity put\noption or asset purchase agreement. Because of these\nenhancements, the SPE issuances typically obtain a more\nfavorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its\nown debt issuances. This results in less expensive financing\ncosts than unsecured debt. The SPE may also enter into\nderivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency\nof the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE investors\nor to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE. Citigroup may\nbe the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the\ncounterparty to any related derivative contracts. Most of\nCitigroup\u2019s SPEs are variable interest entities (VIEs).\n\nVariable Interest Entities VIEs are described in Note 1.\nInvestors that finance the VIE through debt or equity interests\nor other counterparties providing other forms of support, such\nas guarantees, certain fee arrangements or certain types of\nderivative contracts, are variable interest holders in the\nentity. The variable interest holder, if any, that has a\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. The Company\nmust evaluate each VIE to understand the purpose and design of\nthe entity, the role the Company had in the entity\u2019s design and\nits involvement in the VIE\u2019s ongoing activities. The Company\nthen must evaluate which activities most significantly impact\nthe economic performance of the VIE and who has the power to\ndirect such activities. For those VIEs where the Company\ndetermines that it has the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, the\nCompany must then evaluate its economic interests, if any, and\ndetermine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits\nthat could potentially be significant to the VIE. When\nevaluating whether the Company has an obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant, it considers the\nmaximum exposure to such loss without consideration of\nprobability. Such obligations could be in various forms,\nincluding, but not limited to, debt and equity investments,\nguarantees, liquidity agreements and certain derivative\ncontracts. In various other transactions, the Company may (i)\nact as a derivative counterparty (e.g., interest rate swap,\ncross-currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a\ncredit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays\nthe total return on certain assets to the SPE), (ii) act as\nunderwriter or placement agent, (iii) provide administrative,\ntrustee or other services or (iv) make a market in debt\nsecurities or other instruments issued by VIEs. The Company\ngenerally considers such involvement, by itself, not to be\nvariable interests and thus not an indicator of power or\npotentially significant benefits or losses.\n

See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 6billion and $ 69billion\nin unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 282million and $ 498million\nin maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n                              242                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain investment funds\nfor which the Company provides investment management services\nand personal estate trusts for which the Company provides\nadministrative, trustee and/or investment management services; \u2022\ncertain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the\nCompany provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no\ndecision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some\nof which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-\nrelated commitment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions\nwas $ 8.5billion and $ 33.6billion, respectively (see Notes 15\nand 26 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain VIEs\nstructured by third parties in which the Company holds\nsecurities in inventory, as these investments are made on\narm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities held by the Company, which are classified as\nTrading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has\nno other involvement with the related securitization entity\ndeemed to be significant (see Notes 14 and 26 for more\ninformation on these positions); \u2022 certain representations and\nwarranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage\nsecuritizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances\nare no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs such as preferred\nsecurities trusts used in connection with the Company\u2019s funding\nactivities. The Company does not have a variable interest in\nthese trusts. The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent\nthe carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company.\nThe carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the\ncurrent fair value of the assets depending on the classification\nof the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated\naccounting model ascribed to that classification. The asset\nbalances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has\nsignificant involvement represent the most current information\navailable to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances\nrepresent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments,\nunless fair value information is readily available to the\nCompany. The maximum funded exposure represents the balance\nsheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in the VIE. It\nreflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE,\nadjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments\nreceived. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases\nor declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized\nin earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions\nrepresents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including\nliquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the\nnotional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a\nvariable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has\nentered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that\nare not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest\nrate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the\npurchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or\ntotal return swap where the Company pays the total return on\ncertain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements\nare not included in the maximum exposure amounts.\n                              243                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets\ninclude those assets that can only be used to settle obligations\nof consolidated VIEs, presented on the following page, and are\nin excess of those obligations. In addition, the assets include\nthird-party assets of consolidated VIEs only and exclude\nintercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The\nliabilities include third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs\nonly and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in\nconsolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts where\ncreditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to the\ngeneral credit of Citigroup.\n

securitizations that do not qualify\nfor sales treatment; thus, the assets remain on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are\nrecognized as secured liabilities. In general, the third-party\ninvestors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal\nrecourse only to the assets of the respective VIEs and do not\nhave such recourse to the Company, except where Citi has\nprovided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to\ncertain derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus,\nCitigroup\u2019s maximum legal exposure to loss related to\nconsolidated VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value\nof the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding third-party\nfinancing.

Citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on\na non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving\nsecuritizations: as customers pay their credit card balances,\nthe cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and\nreplenish the receivables in the trust. The Company\u2019s primary\ncredit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial majority\nthrough the Master Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities\nbecause, as servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts. Citigroup holds a seller\u2019s interest\nand certain securities issued by the trusts, which could result\nin exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from\nthe trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables\nremain on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet with nogain or loss\nrecognized. The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citi utilizes\nsecuritizations as one of the sources of funding for its\nbusiness in North America.

Once\noriginated, the Company often securitizes these loans through\nthe use of VIEs. These VIEs are funded through the issuance of\ntrust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets.\nThese certificates have the same life as the transferred assets.\nIn addition to providing a source of liquidity and less\nexpensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces Citi\u2019s\ncredit exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan\nsecuritizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers\nof the securities issued by the trust. Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer\nmortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in\ncertain instances retains investment securities, interest-only\nstrips and residual interests in future cash flows from the\ntrusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of\nServices , Markets and Banking securitizations. Citi\u2019s Services\n, Markets and Banking businesses may hold investment securities\npursuant to credit risk retention rules or in connection with\nsecondary market-making activities. The Company securitizes\nmortgage loans generally through either a U.S. government-\nsponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, a U.S. agency-sponsored\nentity, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or a private label\n(non-agency-sponsored mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the\nprimary beneficiary of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage\nsecuritization entities because Citigroup does not have the\npower to direct the activities of the VIEs that most\nsignificantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance.\nTherefore, Citi does not consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored\nmortgage securitization entities. Substantially all of the\nconsumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated\ntrusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans.\nRetained interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage\nsecuritization trusts are classified as Trading account assets ,\nexcept for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on\nCitigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citigroup does not\nconsolidate certain non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitization\nentities because Citi is either not the servicer with the power\nto direct the significant activities of the entity or Citi is\nthe servicer, but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a\nfiduciary relationship; therefore, Citi is not deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary of the entity. In certain instances, the\nCompany has (i) the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance and (ii)\nthe obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive\nbenefits that could be potentially significant to its non-\nagency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities and,\ntherefore, is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates\nthe VIE.\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information\nand retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage\nsecuritizations:\n                                                                \n          2\u2026                20\u2026                20\u2026              \n  \u2026       U\u2026                U.\u2026                U.\u2026              \n  \u2026       a\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026     \n  \u2026       s\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026     \n  \u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  4\u2026    $  6.9    $  1\u2026    $  6.1    $  2\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       4\u2026       3\u2026       6.7       1\u2026       6.4       2\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       0.1        \u2014       0.1           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026        \u2014       0\u2026         \u2014       0\u2026         \u2014       0\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026        \u2014        \u2014       0.1        \u2014       0.2           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n                                                                \nNote: Excludes re-securitization transactions.\nFor non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities where the\ntransfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for sale\naccounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the\ndifference between the carrying value of the transferred assets\nand the proceeds received (generally cash but may be beneficial\ninterests or servicing rights).

quarter\nof 2023, Citi relaunched a\nprogram securitizing other\nconsumer loans into asset-\nbacked securities. The\nprincipal securitized and the\nproceeds from new\nsecuritizations for the year\nended December 31, 2023 were $\n1billion and $ 0.7billion,\nrespectively. The gain\nrecognized on the\nsecuritization of consumer\nloans was $ 7.5million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n(MSRs) In connection with the\nsecuritization of mortgage\nloans, Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer\nmortgage business generally\nretains the servicing rights,\nwhich entitle the Company to a\nfuture stream of cash flows\nbased on the outstanding\nprincipal balances of the\nloans and the contractual\nservicing fee. Failure to\nservice the loans in\naccordance with contractual\nrequirements may lead to a\ntermination of the servicing\nrights and the loss of future\nservicing fees. These\ntransactions create intangible\nassets referred to as MSRs,\nwhich are recorded at fair\nvalue on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The fair value\nof Citi\u2019s capitalized MSRs was\n$ 691million and $ 665million\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The MSRs\ncorrespond to principal loan\nbalances of $ 52billion and $\n51billion as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes\nthe changes in capitalized\nMSRs:\n                                                              \n  In millions of dollars                     2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance, beginning of year              $   665    $   404  \n  Originations                                 66        120  \n  Changes in fair value of MSRs due to         28        201  \n  changes in inputs and assumptions                           \n  Other changes(1)                            -68        -60  \n  Balance, as of December 31              $   691    $   665  \n                                                              \n(1) Represents changes due to\ncustomer payments.\nThe fair value of the MSRs is\nprimarily affected by changes\nin prepayments of mortgages\nthat result from shifts in\nmortgage interest rates.\nSpecifically, higher interest\nrates tend to lead to\ndeclining prepayments, which\ncauses the fair value of the\nMSRs to increase. In managing\nthis risk, Citigroup\neconomically hedges a\nsignificant portion of the\nvalue of its MSRs through the\nuse of interest rate\nderivative contracts, forward\npurchase and sale commitments\nof mortgage-backed securities\nand purchased securities, all\nclassified as Trading account\nassets .\nThe Company receives fees\nduring the course of servicing\npreviously securitized\nmortgages. The amounts of\nthese fees were as follows:\n                                                              \n  In millions of dollars       2023       2022       2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Servicing fees            $   129    $   122    $   131     \n  Late fees                       4          4             3  \n  Total MSR fees            $   133    $   126    $   134     \n                                                              \nIn the Consolidated Statement\nof Income these fees are\nprimarily classified as\nCommissions and fees , and\nchanges in MSR fair values are\nclassified as Other revenue .\nRe-securitizations The Company\nengages in re-securitization\ntransactions in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to\na VIE in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests. Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThese securities are backed by\neither residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of\nclients. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, Citi held no\nretained interests in private\nlabel re-securitization\ntransactions structured by\nCiti. The Company also re-\nsecuritizes U.S. government-\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-\nbacked (agency) securities.\nDuring the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022,\nCiti transferred agency\nsecurities with a fair value\nof approximately $ 17.1billion\nand $ 24.1billion,\nrespectively, to re-\nsecuritization entities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair\nvalue of Citi-retained\ninterests in agency re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.7billion\n(including $ 930million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in\n2023), compared to $\n1.4billion as of December 31,\n2022 (including $ 801million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in\n2022), which is recorded in\nTrading account assets . The\noriginal fair values of agency\nre-securitization transactions\nin which Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022 were\napproximately $ 84.1billion\nand $ 79.4billion,\nrespectively. As of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\ndid not consolidate any\nprivate label or agency re-\nsecuritization entities.\n                              250                               \nCiti-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits The\nCompany is active in the asset-backed commercial paper conduit\nbusiness as administrator of several multi-seller commercial\npaper conduits and also as a service provider to single-seller\nand other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties.\nCiti\u2019s multi-seller commercial paper conduits are designed to\nprovide the Company\u2019s clients access to low-cost funding in the\ncommercial paper markets. The conduits purchase assets from or\nprovide financing facilities to clients and are funded by\nissuing commercial paper to third-party investors. The conduits\ngenerally do not purchase assets originated by Citi. The funding\nof the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and\ncredit enhancements provided by the Company. As administrator to\nCiti\u2019s conduits, the Company is generally responsible for\nselecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the\nconduits, making decisions regarding the funding of the\nconduits, including determining the tenor and other features of\nthe commercial paper issued, monitoring the quality and\nperformance of the conduits\u2019 assets and facilitating the\noperations and cash flows of the conduits. In return, the\nCompany earns structuring fees from customers for individual\ntransactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit,\nwhich is equal to the income from the client program and\nliquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses.\nThis administration fee is fairly stable, since most risks and\nrewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients.\nOnce the asset pricing is negotiated, most ongoing income, costs\nand fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduit\u2019s\nsize. The conduits administered by Citi do not generally invest\nin liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties.\nThe assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions\nthat are generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather\nthan actively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit\non each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial\npaper issued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to\nthe client. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured\nwith transaction-specific credit enhancement features provided\nby the third-party client seller, including over-\ncollateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts,\ndirect recourse or third-party guarantees. These credit\nenhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a\ncredit rating of A or above, based on Citi\u2019s internal risk\nratings. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the commercial paper\nconduits administered by Citi had approximately $ 21.1billion\nand $ 19.6billion of purchased assets outstanding, respectively,\nand had unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $\n16.7billion and $ 13.9billion, respectively. Substantially all\nof the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term\ncommercial paper. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the weighted-\naverage remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by\nthe conduits were approximately 68and 64days, respectively. The\nprimary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is\nin the form of transaction-specific credit enhancements\ndescribed above. Each asset purchased by the conduit is\nstructured with transaction-specific credit enhancement,\nincluding over-collateralization, cash and excess spread\ncollateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees.\nCredit enhancement is sized with the objective of approximating\nan investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi\u2019s internal risk\nratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit\nenhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit from\nthe Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit\u2019s\nassets with a minimum of $ 200million to $ 350million. The\nletters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total\napproximately $ 2.1billion as of December 31, 2023 and $\n1.9billion as of December 31, 2022. The net result across multi-\nseller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the\nevent that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit\nare allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial\npaper investors. Citigroup also provides the conduits with two\nforms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding\nto the conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other\nevents. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a\ntransaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset\npurchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has\ngenerally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables\nfrom the conduit at par. The APA is not designed to provide\ncredit support to the conduit, as it generally does not permit\nthe purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any funding under\nthe APA will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to\nincreased interest costs. In addition, the Company provides the\nconduits with program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term\nlending commitments. Under these commitments, the Company has\nagreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a short-term\ndisruption in the commercial paper market, subject to specified\nconditions. The Company receives fees for providing both types\nof liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair\nmarket terms. Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in\nthe commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-\nbased fee for providing such services. Along with third-party\ndealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper and\nmay from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a\nthird party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the\nmarket, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper\nissued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as\nconduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the\nnormal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper,\nincluding commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company owned $ 10.1billion and\n$ 8.6billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by\nits administered conduits. The Company\u2019s investments were not\ndriven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated\nunder any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by\nthe conduits. The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are\nconsolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, through\nits roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has the\npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact\nthe entities\u2019 economic performance. These powers include its\nability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the\nconduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation\nactivities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the\n                              251                               \nconduits and its liability\nmanagement. In addition, as a\nresult of all the Company\u2019s\ninvolvement described above,\nit was concluded that Citi has\nan economic interest that\ncould potentially be\nsignificant. No assets of any\nconduit are available to\nsatisfy the creditors of\nCitigroup or any of its other\nsubsidiaries. Collateralized\nLoan Obligations (CLOs) A\ncollateralized loan obligation\n(CLO) is a VIE that purchases\na portfolio of assets\nconsisting primarily of non-\ninvestment grade corporate\nloans. CLOs issue multiple\ntranches of debt and equity to\ninvestors to fund the asset\npurchases and pay upfront\nexpenses associated with\nforming the CLO. A third-party\nasset manager is contracted by\nthe CLO to purchase the\nunderlying assets from the\nopen market and monitor the\ncredit risk associated with\nthose assets. Over the term of\na CLO, the asset manager\ndirects purchases and sales of\nassets in a manner consistent\nwith the CLO\u2019s asset\nmanagement agreement and\nindenture. In general, the CLO\nasset manager will have the\npower to direct the activities\nof the entity that most\nsignificantly impact the\neconomic performance of the\nCLO. Investors in a CLO,\nthrough their ownership of\ndebt and/or equity in it, can\nalso direct certain activities\nof the CLO, including removing\nits asset manager under\nlimited circumstances,\noptionally redeeming the\nnotes, voting on amendments to\nthe CLO\u2019s operating documents\nand other activities. A CLO\nhas a finite life, typically\n12years. Citi serves as a\nstructuring and placement\nagent with respect to the\nCLOs. Typically, the debt and\nequity of the CLOs are sold to\nthird-party investors. On\noccasion, certain Citi\nentities may purchase some\nportion of a CLO\u2019s liabilities\nfor investment purposes. In\naddition, Citi may purchase,\ntypically in the secondary\nmarket, certain securities\nissued by the CLOs to support\nits market-making activities.\nThe Company generally does not\nhave the power to direct the\nactivities that most\nsignificantly impact the\neconomic performance of the\nCLOs, as this power is\ngenerally held by a third-\nparty asset manager of the\nCLO. As such, those CLOs are\nnot consolidated.\nThe following tables summarize\nselected cash flow information\nand retained interests related\nto Citigroup CLOs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of dollars            2023       2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash flows received on                                        \n  retained                       $   0.1    $   0.3    $   1.1  \n  interests and other net                                       \n  cash flows                                                    \n  Purchases of previously                                       \n  transferred                          \u2014          \u2014        0.2  \n  financial assets                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millions                                                      \n  of                Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,  \n  dollars               2023             2022             2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying                                                      \n  value of     $         604    $         681    $         921  \n  retained                                                      \n  interests                                                     \n                                                                \nAll of Citi\u2019s retained interests were held-to-maturity\nsecurities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nMunicipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts Municipal\nTOB trusts may hold fixed- or floating-rate, taxable or tax-\nexempt securities issued by state and local governments and\nmunicipalities. TOB trusts are typically structured as single-\nissuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the\nCompany or from other investors in the municipal securities\nmarket. TOB trusts finance the purchase of their municipal\nassets by issuing two classes of certificates: long-dated,\nfloating rate certificates (\u201cFloaters\u201d) that are putable\npursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest\ncertificates (\u201cResiduals\u201d). The Floaters are purchased by third-\nparty investors, typically tax-exempt money market funds. The\nResiduals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal\nsecurities that are being financed. From Citigroup\u2019s\nperspective, there are twotypes of TOB trusts: customer and non-\ncustomer. Customer TOB trusts are those trusts utilized by\ncustomers of the Company to finance their securities, generally\nmunicipal securities. The Residuals issued by these trusts are\npurchased by the customer being financed. Non-customer TOB\ntrusts are generally used by the Company to finance its own\nmunicipal securities investments; the Residuals issued by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are purchased by the Company. With respect\nto both customer and non-customer TOB trusts, Citi may provide\nremarketing agent services. If Floaters are optionally tendered\nand the Company, in its role as remarketing agent, is unable to\nfind a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered Floaters\nwithin a specified period of time, Citigroup may, but is not\nobligated to, purchase the tendered Floaters into its own\ninventory. The level of the Company\u2019s inventory of such Floaters\nfluctuates. For certain customer TOB trusts, Citi may also serve\nas a voluntary advance provider. In this capacity, the Company\nmay, but is not obligated to, make loan advances to customer TOB\ntrusts to purchase optionally tendered Floaters that have not\notherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors. Such\nloans are secured by pledged Floaters. As of December 31, 2023,\nCiti had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer TOB\ntrusts. For certain non-customer trusts, the Company also\nprovides credit enhancement. At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nnoneof the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were\nsubject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company. Citigroup\nalso provides liquidity services to many customer and non-\ncustomer trusts. If a trust is unwound early due to an event\nother than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds, the\nunderlying municipal bonds are sold out of the trust and bond\nsale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust\ncertificates. If this results in a shortfall between the bond\nsale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered Floaters,\nthe Company, pursuant to the liquidity agreement, would be\nobligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that\nshortfall. For certain customer TOB trusts, Citigroup has also\nexecuted a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the\nResidual, pursuant to which the Residual holder is obligated to\nreimburse the Company for any payment the Company makes under\nthe liquidity arrangement. These reimbursement agreements may be\nsubject to daily margining based on changes in the market value\nof the underlying\n                              252                               \nmunicipal bonds. In cases where a third party provides liquidity\nto a non-customer TOB trust, a similar reimbursement arrangement\nmay be executed, whereby the Company (or a consolidated\nsubsidiary of the Company), as Residual holder, would absorb any\nlosses incurred by the liquidity provider. For certain other\nnon-customer TOB trusts, Citi serves as tender option provider.\nThe tender option provider arrangement allows Floater holders to\nput their interests directly to the Company at any time, subject\nto the requisite notice period requirements, at a price of par.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, liquidity agreements provided\nwith respect to customer TOB trusts totaled $ 0.4billion and $\n1.1billion, respectively, of which $ 0.3billion and $\n0.7billion, respectively, were offset by reimbursement\nagreements. For the remaining exposure related to TOB\ntransactions, where the residual owned by the customer was at\nleast 25% of the bond value at the inception of the transaction,\nno reimbursement agreement was executed. Citi considers both\ncustomer and non-customer TOB trusts to be VIEs. Customer TOB\ntrusts are not consolidated by the Company, as the power to\ndirect the activities that most significantly impact the trust\u2019s\neconomic performance rests with the customer Residual holder,\nwhich may unilaterally cause the sale of the trust\u2019s bonds. Non-\ncustomer TOB trusts generally are consolidated because the\nCompany holds the Residual interest and thus has the unilateral\npower to cause the sale of the trust\u2019s bonds. The Company also\nprovides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to\ncustomer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not\nvariable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers\nthat totaled $ 1.2billion as of December 31, 2023 and $\n1.4billion as of December 31, 2022. These liquidity agreements\nand letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements\nwith various term-out provisions. Municipal Investments\nMunicipal investment transactions include debt and equity\ninterests in partnerships that finance the construction and\nrehabilitation of low-income housing, facilitate lending in new\nor underserved markets or finance the construction or operation\nof renewable municipal energy facilities. Citi generally invests\nin these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return\nprimarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned\nfrom the investments made by the partnership. The Company may\nalso provide construction loans or permanent loans for the\ndevelopment or operation of real estate properties held by\npartnerships. These entities are generally considered VIEs. The\npower to direct the activities of these entities is typically\nheld by the general partner. Accordingly, these entities are not\nconsolidated by Citigroup. Client Intermediation Client\nintermediation transactions represent a range of transactions\ndesigned to provide investors with specified returns based on\nthe returns of an underlying security, referenced asset or\nindex. These transactions include credit-linked notes and\nequity-linked notes. In these transactions, the VIE typically\nobtains exposure to the underlying security, referenced asset or\nindex through a derivative instrument, such as a total-return\nswap or a credit-default swap. In turn, the VIE issues notes to\ninvestors that pay a return based on the specified underlying\nsecurity, referenced asset or index. The VIE invests the\nproceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract\nthat serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the\nterm of the transaction. The Company\u2019s involvement in these\ntransactions includes being the counterparty to the VIE\u2019s\nderivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes\nissued by the VIE. In certain transactions, the investor\u2019s\nmaximum risk of loss is limited and the Company absorbs risk of\nloss above a specified level. Citi does not have the power to\ndirect the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact\ntheir economic performance and thus it does not consolidate\nthem. Citi\u2019s maximum risk of loss in these transactions is\ndefined as the amount invested in notes issued by the VIE and\nthe notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by Citi through\na separate instrument issued by the VIE. The derivative\ninstrument held by the Company may generate a receivable from\nthe VIE (e.g., where the Company purchases credit protection\nfrom the VIE in connection with the VIE\u2019s issuance of a credit-\nlinked note), which is collateralized by the assets owned by the\nVIE. These derivative instruments are not considered variable\ninterests and any associated receivables are not included in the\ncalculation of maximum exposure to the VIE. Investment Funds The\nCompany is the investment manager for certain investment funds\nand retirement funds that invest in various asset classes\nincluding private equity, hedge funds, real estate, fixed income\nand infrastructure. Citigroup earns a management fee, which is a\npercentage of capital under management, and may earn performance\nfees. In addition, for some of these funds the Company has an\nownership interest in the investment funds. Citi has also\nestablished a number of investment funds as opportunities for\nqualified employees to invest in private equity investments. The\nCompany acts as investment manager for these funds and may\nprovide employees with financing on both recourse and non-\nrecourse bases for a portion of the employees\u2019 investment\ncommitments.\n                              253                               \nAsset-Based Financing\n\nThe Company provides loans and other forms of financing to VIEs\nthat hold assets. Those loans are subject to the same credit\napprovals as all other loans originated or purchased by the\nCompany. Financings in the form of debt securities or\nderivatives are, in most circumstances, reported in Trading\naccount assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings.\nThe Company generally does not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact these VIEs\u2019 economic\nperformance; thus, it does not consolidate them.\n\nThe primary types of Citi\u2019s asset-based financings, total assets\nof the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to\nrealize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to\ndefault with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.\n                                                                \n               Decemb\u2026                    Decemb\u2026               \n                   31,                        31,               \n                  2023                       2022               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                         Maxim\u2026                     Maxim\u2026  \n  milli\u2026       Totalu\u2026       tounc\u2026       Totalu\u2026       tounc\u2026  \n  of            assets         VIEs        assets         VIEs  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Type                                                          \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  other     $   42,869    $   8,831    $   43,236    $   8,806  \n  real                                                          \n  estate                                                        \n  Corpo\u2026        27,903       18,546        23,120       15,077  \n  loans                                                         \n  Other                                                         \n  (incl\u2026                                                        \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  funds,       121,711       35,367       166,320       27,986  \n  airli\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  shipp\u2026                                                        \n  Total     $  192,483    $  62,744    $  232,676    $  51,869  \n                                                                \n                              254                               \n                                                                \n  24.

Futures contracts and other option\ncontracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an\nexchange with a CCP as the counterparty from the inception of\nthe transaction. Citigroup enters into derivative contracts\nrelating to interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and other\nmarket/credit risks for the following reasons: \u2022 Trading\nPurposes : Citigroup trades derivatives as an active market\nmaker. Citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection\nwith their risk management actions to transfer, modify or reduce\ntheir interest rate, foreign exchange and other market/credit\nrisks or for their own trading purposes. Citigroup also manages\nits derivative risk positions through offsetting trade\nactivities. \u2022 Hedging : Citigroup uses derivatives in connection\nwith its own risk management activities to hedge certain risks\nor reposition the risk profile of the Company. Hedging may be\naccomplished by applying hedge accounting in accordance with ASC\n815, Derivatives and Hedging . For example, Citigroup issues\nfixed-rate long-term debt and then enters into a receive-fixed,\npay-variable-rate interest rate swap with the same tenor and\nnotional amount to synthetically convert the interest payments\nto a net variable-rate basis. This strategy is the most common\nform of an interest rate hedge, as it minimizes net interest\ncost in certain yield curve environments. Derivatives are also\nused to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of on-\nbalance sheet assets and liabilities, including AFS securities,\ncommodities and borrowings, as well as other interest-sensitive\nassets and liabilities. In addition, foreign exchange contracts\nare used to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt, foreign\ncurrency-denominated AFS securities and net investment\nexposures.\n\nDerivatives may expose Citigroup to market, credit or liquidity\nrisks in excess of the amounts recorded on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Market risk on a derivative product is the\nexposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates,\nmarket prices, foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a\nfunction of the type of product, the volume of transactions, the\ntenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility.\nCredit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of\nnonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative\nliability where the value of any collateral held by Citi is not\nadequate to cover such losses. The recognition in earnings of\nunrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to\nmanagement\u2019s assessment of the probability of counterparty\ndefault. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises\nwhen the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to\nmonetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a\nreasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial\nstress. Derivative transactions are customarily documented under\nindustry standard master netting agreements, which provide that\nfollowing an event of default, the non-defaulting party may\npromptly terminate all transactions between the parties and\ndetermine the net amount due to be paid to, or by, the\ndefaulting party. Events of default include (i) failure to make\na payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured\nfollowing applicable notice and grace periods, (ii) breach of\nagreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace\nperiods, (iii) breach of a representation, (iv) cross default,\neither to third-party debt or to other derivative transactions\nentered into between the parties, or, in some cases, their\naffiliates, (v) the occurrence of a merger or consolidation that\nresults in the creditworthiness of a party becoming materially\nweaker, and (vi) the cessation or repudiation of any applicable\nguarantee or other credit support document. Obligations under\nmaster netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted\nunder an industry standard credit support annex to the master\nnetting agreement. An event of default may also occur under a\ncredit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral\ndelivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and\ngrace periods. The netting and collateral rights incorporated in\nthe master netting agreements are considered to be legally\nenforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from\ncounsel of recognized standing that provides (i) the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding enforceability and (ii) that the\nexercise of rights by the non-defaulting party to terminate and\nclose-out transactions on a net basis under these agreements\nwill not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event\nof default, including bankruptcy, insolvency or similar\nproceeding. A legal opinion may not be sought for certain\njurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the\nenforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or\nconflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of\nsuch rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of\ncertainty. For example, this may be the case for certain\nsovereigns, municipalities, central banks and U.S. pension\nplans.\n                              255                               \nExposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market\nvolatility, which may impair the ability of counterparties to\nsatisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit limits are\nestablished and closely monitored for customers engaged in\nderivatives transactions. Citi considers the level of legal\ncertainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights\nunder master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be\nan important factor in its risk management process.\nSpecifically, Citi generally transacts much lower volumes of\nderivatives under master netting agreements where Citi does not\nhave the requisite level of legal certainty regarding\nenforceability, because such derivatives consume greater amounts\nof single counterparty credit limits than those executed under\nenforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral and\nsecurity collateral in the form of G10 government debt\nsecurities are often posted by a party to a master netting\nagreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party;\nthe receiving party is free to commingle/rehypothecate such\ncollateral in the ordinary course of its business. Nonstandard\ncollateral such as corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. agency\nsecurities and/or MBS may also be pledged as collateral for\nderivative transactions. Security collateral posted to open and\nmaintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty, in the\nform of cash and/or securities, may from time to time be\nsegregated in an account at a third-party custodian pursuant to\na tri-party account control agreement. Information pertaining to\nCitigroup\u2019s derivatives activities, based on notional amounts,\nis presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are\nreference amounts from which contractual payments are derived\nand do not represent a complete measure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions. Citi\u2019s derivative exposure arises\nprimarily from market fluctuations (i.e., market risk),\ncounterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high\nvolatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well\nas any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the\ntransactions. Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the\nnetting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and\noffsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed\nposition with a different counterparty, $200 million in\nderivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting\npositions may result in de minimis overall market risk. In\naddition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate\nfrom period to period in the normal course of business based on\nCiti\u2019s market share, levels of client activity and other\nfactors. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/\nTrading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n                              256                               \nDerivative

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\nThe following tables present the gross and net fair values of\nthe Company\u2019s derivative transactions and the related offsetting\namounts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against gross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements.\nUnder ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or paid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support annex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security\ncollateral. In addition, the following tables reflect rule\nchanges adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow\nentities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as settlement of the related derivative\nfair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to\npresenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are\nsubject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables\nalso present amounts that are not permitted to be offset, such\nas security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion\nsupporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights\nhas been obtained.\n                              257

As a general rule, hedge accounting is permitted where\nthe Company is exposed to a particular risk, such as interest\nrate or foreign exchange risk, that causes changes in the fair\nvalue of an asset or liability or variability in the expected\nfuture cash flows of an existing asset, liability or a\nforecasted transaction that may affect earnings. Derivative\ncontracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair\nvalue are referred to as fair value hedges, while contracts\nhedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash\nflow hedges. Hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments\nto manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity\ninvestments in non-U.S.-dollar-functional-currency foreign\nsubsidiaries (i.e., net investment in a foreign operation) are\nnet investment hedges. To qualify as an accounting hedge under\nthe hedge accounting rules (versus an economic hedge where hedge\naccounting is not applied), a hedging relationship must be\nhighly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being\nhedged. The hedging relationship must be formally documented at\ninception, detailing the particular risk management objective\nand strategy for the hedge. This includes the item and risk(s)\nbeing hedged, the hedging instrument being used and how\neffectiveness will be assessed.\n\nThe effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at\nhedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective\nand prospective basis, typically using quantitative measures of\ncorrelation. Hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are\nperformed in a similar manner for similar hedges, and are used\nconsistently throughout the hedging relationships. The\nassessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of\nthe hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and\nthe changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time\nvalue. Discontinued Hedge Accounting A hedging instrument must\nbe highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of\noffsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the\nhedged item for the risk being hedged. Management may\nvoluntarily de-designate an accounting hedge at any time, but if\na hedging relationship is not highly effective, it no longer\nqualifies for hedge accounting and must be de-designated.\nSubsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are\nrecognized in Other revenue or Principal transactions , similar\nto trading derivatives, with no offset recorded related to the\nhedged item. For fair value hedges, any changes in the carrying\nvalue of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the\nasset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of\nthe yield on the item. For cash flow hedges, changes in fair\nvalue of the end-user derivative remain in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and are included in the\nearnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows\nimpact earnings. However, if it becomes probable that some or\nall of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur, any\namounts that remain in AOCI related to these transactions must\nbe immediately reflected in Other revenue . The foregoing\ncriteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with\nthe level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to\nvarious limits and controls. The underlying asset, liability or\nforecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio\nof similar items. Fair Value Hedges Hedging of Benchmark\nInterest Rate Risk Citigroup\u2019s fair value hedges, which include\nhedges of closed pools of assets, are primarily hedges of fixed-\nrate long-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt\nsecurities or loans. For qualifying fair value hedges of\ninterest rate risk, the changes in the fair value of the\nderivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are presented within Interest\nincome or Interest expense based on whether the hedged item is\nan asset or a liability.\n                              260                               \nHedging of Foreign Exchange Risk Citigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt securities and long-term debt that are\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of\nthe entity holding the securities or issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange\ncontract or a cross-currency swap contract. Changes in the fair\nvalue of the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference)\nof forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in the\nfair value of cross-currency basis associated with cross-\ncurrency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecords them in Other comprehensive income. Hedging of Commodity\nPrice Risk Citigroup hedges the change in fair value\nattributable to spot price movements in physical commodities\ninventories. The hedging instrument is a futures contract to\nsell the underlying commodity. In this hedge, the change in the\ncarrying value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings,\nwhich offsets the change in the fair value of the futures\ncontract that is also reflected in earnings. Although the entire\nchange in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded\nin earnings, under certain hedge programs, Citigroup excludes\nchanges in the fair value of the forward points (i.e., spot-\nforward difference) of the futures contract from the assessment\nof hedge effectiveness, and they are generally reflected\ndirectly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Under other\nhedge programs, Citi excludes changes in the fair value of\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecords them in Other comprehensive income .\n\nThe following

Variable cash flows from those\nliabilities are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows\nby entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps\nand receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate\nswaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are\nsynthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering\ninto receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash\nflow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or\ndollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging\nrelationships are highly effective at inception and on an\nongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the\nfair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and\nthen reclassified to earnings in the same period that the\nforecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The pretax change\nin AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  d\u2026       20\u2026                 20\u2026                20\u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  I\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026    $            -4\u2026    $            -\u2026    $            -\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                  13                 34                 -\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026    $            -4\u2026    $            -\u2026    $            -\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n           Ot\u2026       Net       Ot\u2026       N\u2026       Ot\u2026       N\u2026  \n           re\u2026       in\u2026       re\u2026       i\u2026       re\u2026       i\u2026  \n                     in\u2026                 i\u2026                 i\u2026  \n  A\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  I\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026    $    \u2014    $  -1\u2026    $    \u2014    $  -\u2026    $    \u2014    $  1\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026        -4         \u2014        -4        \u2014        -4        \u2014  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026    $   -4    $  -1\u2026    $   -4    $  -\u2026    $   -4    $  1\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  N\u2026                                                            \n  p\u2026                                                            \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  in                                                            \n  c\u2026              $  1,\u2026              $  -\u2026              $  -\u2026  \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  h\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  w\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate\ncontracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net\ninterest income) . For all other hedges, the amounts\nreclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue\nand Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of December 31, 2023\nis approximately $( 0.8) billion. The maximum length of time\nover which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 15years. The\nafter-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is presented in\nNote 21.\n                              263                               \nNet Investment Hedges Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign\nCurrency Matters\u2014Foreign Currency Transactions , ASC 815 allows\nthe hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in\na foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards,\ncross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated\ndebt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated\nwith Citigroup\u2019s equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollar-\nfunctional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the\nchange in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the\ntranslation adjustment for the investments in these foreign\nsubsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustmen t (CTA)\nwithin AOCI . For derivatives designated as net investment\nhedges, Citigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in\nASC 815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair\nvalue, including changes related to the forward-rate component\nof the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of\nforeign currency options, are recorded in CTA within AOCI . For\nforeign currency-denominated debt instruments that are\ndesignated as hedges of net investments, the translation gain or\nloss that is recorded in CTA is based on the spot exchange rate\nbetween the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and\nthe U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency of Citigroup.\nThe pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI , related to\nnet investment hedges, was $( 1.4) billion, $ 370million and $\n855million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $\n36million pretax loss related to net investment hedges,\nrespectively, which were reclassified from AOCI into earnings\n(recorded in Other revenue ). Economic Hedges Citigroup often\nuses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex\nor operationally burdensome. End-user derivatives that are\neconomic hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in value\nincluded in either Principal transactions or Other revenue . For\nasset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-term debt is\nrecorded at amortized cost under GAAP. For other hedges that\neither do not meet the ASC 815 hedging criteria or for which\nmanagement decides not to apply ASC 815 hedge accounting, the\nderivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with\nthe associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings, while\nthe debt continues to be carried at amortized cost. Therefore,\ncurrent earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and\nother factors that cause a change in the swap\u2019s value, but for\nwhich no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt.\nCitigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at\nfair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable\nelection is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in\nfair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in\nfair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected\nin earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt\u2019s fair\nvalue change. To the extent that the two amounts differ because\nthe full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not\noffset by the interest rate swap, the difference is\nautomatically captured in current earnings. Additional economic\nhedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial\nloans and loan commitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its\nhedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an\naccounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the\nrelative costs and benefits. Economic hedges are also employed\nwhen the hedged item itself is marked-to-market through current\nearnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one- to\nfour-family mortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs. Credit\nDerivatives Citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit\nderivatives. Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or\nwrites protection on either a single name or a portfolio of\nreference credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help\nmitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan\nportfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client\ntransactions. Citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in\ncredit derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\napproximately 98% and 98%, respectively, of the gross\nreceivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains\nmaster netting agreements, collateral agreements or settles\ndaily. A majority of Citi\u2019s top 15counterparties (by receivable\nbalance owed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks,\nfinancial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these\ncounterparties do not include ratings-based termination events.\nHowever, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental\neffect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may call for\nadditional collateral. The range of credit derivatives entered\ninto includes credit default swaps, total return swaps, credit\noptions and credit-linked notes. A credit default swap is a\ncontract in which, for a fee, a protection seller agrees to\nreimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a\npredefined credit event on a reference entity. These credit\nevents are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and\nthe reference entity and are generally limited to the market\nstandard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the\nreference entity and, in a more limited range of transactions,\ndebt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions that\nreference emerging market entities also typically include\nadditional credit events to cover the acceleration of\nindebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment\nmoratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided\non a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed securities.\nIf there is no credit event, as defined by the specific\nderivative contract, then the protection seller makes no\npayments to the protection buyer and receives only the\ncontractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs\nas defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the\nprotection seller will be required to make a payment to the\nprotection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of\nprotection may not be required to make a payment until a\nspecified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the\nportfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a\nspecified amount.\n                              264                               \nA total return swap typically transfers the total economic\nperformance of a reference asset, which includes all associated\ncash flows, as well as capital appreciation or depreciation. The\nprotection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any\ndepreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller\nand, in return, the protection seller receives the cash flows\nassociated with the reference asset plus any appreciation. Thus,\naccording to the total return swap agreement, the protection\nseller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating\ninterest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference\nasset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying\nasset. A total return swap may terminate upon a default of the\nreference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference\nentity, subject to the provisions of the related total return\nswap agreement between the protection seller and the protection\nbuyer. A credit option is a credit derivative that allows\ninvestors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a\nreference entity. For example, in a credit spread option, the\noption writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit\nprotection on the reference entity at a specified \u201cstrike\u201d\nspread level. The option purchaser buys the right to sell credit\ndefault protection on the reference entity to, or purchase it\nfrom, the option writer at the strike spread level. The payments\non credit spread options depend either on a particular credit\nspread or the price of the underlying credit-sensitive asset or\nother reference entity. The options usually terminate if a\ncredit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference\nentity. A credit-linked note is a form of credit derivative\nstructured as a debt security with an embedded credit default\nswap. The purchaser of the note effectively provides credit\nprotection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that\ncould be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying\nreference entity. If the reference entity defaults, the note may\nbe cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt\nsecurity of the reference entity. Thus, the maximum amount of\nthe note purchaser\u2019s exposure is the amount paid for the credit-\nlinked note.\n                              265                               \nThe following tables

sold.\n(2) The fair value amount payable is composed of $ 3,573million\nunder protection purchased and $ 4,204million under protection\nsold.\nFair values included in the above tables are prior to\napplication of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For\nnotional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the\ntotal notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it\nmay hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into\noffsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The\nopen risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely\nmatched after certain cash positions in reference assets are\nconsidered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either to a\nduration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of\nsubordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit\nderivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to\nevaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned\ninternal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be \u201cBaa/BBB\u201d and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. Citigroup\nevaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives\nfor which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit\nrating assigned to the underlying reference credit. Credit\nderivatives written on an underlying non-investment-grade\nreference entity represent greater payment risk to the Company.\nThe non-investment-grade category in the table above also\nincludes credit derivatives where the underlying reference\nentity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the\nderivative.\n                              266                               \nThe maximum potential amount\nof future payments under\ncredit derivative contracts\npresented in the table above\nis based on the notional value\nof the derivatives. The\nCompany believes that the\nnotional amount for credit\nprotection sold is not\nrepresentative of the actual\nloss exposure based on\nhistorical experience. This\namount has not been reduced by\nthe value of the reference\nassets and the related cash\nflows. In accordance with most\ncredit derivative contracts,\nshould a credit event occur,\nthe Company usually is liable\nfor the difference between the\nprotection sold and the value\nof the reference assets.\nFurthermore, the notional\namount for credit protection\nsold has not been reduced for\nany cash collateral paid to a\ngiven counterparty, as such\npayments would be calculated\nafter netting all derivative\nexposures, including any\ncredit derivatives with that\ncounterparty in accordance\nwith a related master netting\nagreement. Due to such netting\nprocesses, determining the\namount of collateral that\ncorresponds to credit\nderivative exposures alone is\nnot possible. The Company\nactively monitors open credit-\nrisk exposures and manages\nthis exposure by using a\nvariety of strategies,\nincluding purchased credit\nderivatives, cash collateral\nor direct holdings of the\nreferenced assets. This risk\nmitigation activity is not\ncaptured in the table above.\nCredit Risk-Related Contingent\nFeatures in Derivatives\nCertain derivative instruments\ncontain provisions that\nrequire the Company to either\npost additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at December\n31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n15billion and $ 18billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 12billion and $\n15billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. A downgrade\ncould trigger additional\ncollateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company\nand certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and\nCitibank were downgraded a\nsingle notch by all threemajor\nrating agencies as of December\n31, 2023, the Company could be\nrequired to post an additional\n$ 0.5billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 33million upon the single\nnotch downgrade, resulting in\naggregate cash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $ 0.5billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers The\nCompany executes total return\nswaps that provide it with\nsynthetic exposure to\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic return of the\nsecurities or other financial\nassets referenced in the\ncontract. In certain cases,\nthe derivative transaction is\naccompanied by the Company\u2019s\ntransfer of the referenced\nfinancial asset to the\nderivative counterparty, most\ntypically in response to the\nderivative counterparty\u2019s\ndesire to hedge, in whole or\nin part, its synthetic\nexposure under the derivative\ncontract by holding the\nreferenced asset in funded\nform. In certain jurisdictions\nthese transactions qualify as\nsales, resulting in\nderecognition of the\nsecurities transferred (see\nNote 1 for further discussion\nof the related sale conditions\nfor transfers of financial\nassets). For a significant\nportion of the transactions,\nthe Company has also executed\nanother total return swap\nwhere the Company passes on\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic return of the\nreferenced securities to a\ndifferent third party seeking\nthe exposure. In those cases,\nthe Company is not exposed, on\na net basis, to changes in the\neconomic return of the\nreferenced securities. These\ntransactions generally involve\nthe transfer of the Company\u2019s\nliquid government bonds,\nconvertible bonds or publicly\ntraded corporate equity\nsecurities from the trading\nportfolio and are executed\nwith third-party financial\ninstitutions. The accompanying\nderivatives are typically\ntotal return swaps. The\nderivatives are cash settled\nand subject to ongoing margin\nrequirements. When the\nconditions for sale accounting\nare met, the Company reports\nthe transfer of the referenced\nfinancial asset as a sale and\nseparately reports the\naccompanying derivative\ntransaction. These\ntransactions generally do not\nresult in a gain or loss on\nthe sale of the security,\nbecause the transferred\nsecurity was held at fair\nvalue in the Company\u2019s trading\nportfolio. For transfers of\nfinancial assets accounted for\nas a sale by the Company, and\nfor which the Company has\nretained substantially all of\nthe economic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n4.3billion and $ 1.4billion as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. At December 31,\n2023, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 4.3billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of December 31, 2023\nwas $ 121million recorded as\ngross derivative assets and $\n29million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n1.4billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 27million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n32million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              267                               \n                                                                \n  25. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK                             \n                                                                \nConcentrations of credit risk\nexist when changes in\neconomic, industry or\ngeographic factors similarly\naffect groups of\ncounterparties whose aggregate\ncredit exposure is material in\nrelation to Citigroup\u2019s total\ncredit exposure. Although\nCitigroup\u2019s portfolio of\nfinancial instruments is\nbroadly diversified along\nindustry, product and\ngeographic lines, material\ntransactions are completed\nwith other financial\ninstitutions, particularly in\nthe securities trading,\nderivatives and foreign\nexchange businesses. In\nconnection with the Company\u2019s\nefforts to maintain a\ndiversified portfolio, the\nCompany limits its exposure to\nany one geographic region,\ncountry or individual creditor\nand monitors this exposure on\na continuous basis. At\nDecember 31, 2023, Citigroup\u2019s\nmost significant concentration\nof credit risk was with the\nU.S. government and its\nagencies. The Company\u2019s\nexposure, which primarily\nresults from trading assets\nand investments issued by the\nU.S. government and its\nagencies, amounted to $\n517.2billion and $\n431.6billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe German, Mexican, Japanese\nand United Kingdom governments\nand their agencies, which are\nrated investment grade by both\nMoody\u2019s and S&P, were the next\nlargest exposures. The\nCompany\u2019s exposure to Germany\namounted to $ 39.8billion and\n$ 48.3billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to\nMexico amounted to $\n32.8billion and $ 31.1billion\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The Company\u2019s\nexposure to Japan amounted to\n$ 29.6billion and $\n40.0billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to the\nUnited Kingdom amounted to $\n23.8billion and $ 31.7billion\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The foreign\ngovernment exposures are\ncomposed of investment\nsecurities, loans and trading\nassets. The Company\u2019s exposure\nto states and municipalities\namounted to $ 17.6billion and\n$ 20.1billion at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively,\nand was composed of trading\nassets, investment securities,\nderivatives and lending\nactivities.\n                              268                               \n                                                                \n  26. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT                                    \n                                                                \nASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement , defines fair value,\nestablishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and\nrequires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value\nis defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date, and\ntherefore represents an exit price. Among other things, the\nstandard requires the Company to maximize the use of observable\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value. Under ASC 820-10, the probability of\ncounterparty default is factored into the valuation of\nderivatives and other positions, and the impact of Citigroup\u2019s\nown credit risk is factored into the valuation of derivatives\nand other liabilities that are measured at fair value. Fair\nValue Hierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based\non whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable\ninputs are developed using market data and reflect market\nparticipant assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the\nCompany\u2019s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have\ncreated the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022 Level 2:\nQuoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted\nprices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are\nnot active and model-derived valuations in which all significant\ninputs and value drivers are observable in the market. \u2022 Level\n3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or\nmore significant inputs or significant value drivers are\nunobservable . As required under the fair value hierarchy, the\nCompany considers relevant and observable market inputs in its\nvaluations where possible. The fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach typically utilizes rules-based and data-\ndriven criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified\nas Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022 The determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1 instrument is based upon the frequency of\nobserved transactions and the quality of independent market data\navailable on the measurement date. \u2022 A Level 2 classification is\nassigned where there is observability of prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to\nthe valuation. The determination of whether an input is\nconsidered observable is based on the availability of\nindependent market data and its corroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions in the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as Level 3.\n\nDetermination of Fair Value For assets and liabilities carried\nat fair value, the Company measures fair value using the\nprocedures set out below, irrespective of whether the assets and\nliabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an\nelection, a non-recurring lower-of-cost-or-market (LOCOM)\nadjustment, or because they are required to be measured at fair\nvalue. When available, the Company uses quoted market prices\nfrom active markets to determine fair value and classifies such\nitems as Level 1. In some specific cases where a market price is\navailable, the Company will apply practical expedients (such as\nmatrix pricing) to calculate fair value, in which case the items\nmay be classified as Level 2. The Company may also apply a\nprice-based methodology that utilizes, where available, quoted\nprices or other market information obtained from recent trading\nactivity in positions with the same or similar characteristics\nto the position being valued. If relevant and observable prices\nare available, those valuations may be classified as Level 2.\nHowever, when there are one or more significant unobservable\n\u201cprice\u201d inputs, those valuations will be classified as Level 3.\nFurthermore, when a quoted price is considered stale, a\nsignificant adjustment to the price of a similar security is\nnecessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual\nsecurity being valued, or alternatively, when prices from\nindependent sources are insufficient to corroborate a valuation,\nthe \u201cprice\u201d inputs are considered unobservable and the fair\nvalue measurements are classified as Level 3. If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair value is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation techniques that use, where possible, current\nmarket-based parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates\nand option volatilities. Items valued using such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques are classified according to the\nlowest level input or value driver that is significant to the\nvaluation. Thus, an item may be classified as Level 3 even\nthough there may be some significant inputs that are readily\nobservable. Fair value estimates from internal valuation\ntechniques are verified, where possible, to prices obtained from\nindependent vendors or brokers. Vendor and broker valuations may\nbe based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to\nproprietary valuation models, and the Company assesses the\nquality and relevance of this information in determining the\nestimate of fair value. The following section describes the\nvaluation methodologies used by the Company to measure various\nfinancial instruments at fair value. Where appropriate, the\ndescription includes details of the valuation models, the key\ninputs to those models and any significant assumptions. Market\nValuation Adjustments Generally, the unit of account for a\nfinancial instrument is the individual financial instrument. The\nCompany applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent\nwith the unit of account, which do not include adjustments due\nto the size of the Company\u2019s position, except as follows. ASC\n820-10 permits an exception, through an accounting policy\nelection, to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial\nassets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open\nrisk position when certain criteria are met. Citi has elected to\nmeasure\n                              269                               \ncertain portfolios of\nfinancial instruments that\nmeet those criteria, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open risk position.\nThe Company applies market\nvaluation adjustments,\nincluding adjustments to\naccount for the size of the\nnet open risk position,\nconsistent with market\nparticipant assumptions.\nValuation adjustments are\napplied to items classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy to ensure that\nthe fair value reflects the\nprice at which the net open\nrisk position could be exited.\nThese valuation adjustments\nare based on the bid/offer\nspread for an instrument in\nthe market. When Citi has\nelected to measure certain\nportfolios of financial\ninvestments, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open risk position,\nthe valuation adjustment may\ntake into account the size of\nthe position. Credit valuation\nadjustments (CVA) and funding\nvaluation adjustments (FVA)\nare applied to certain over-\nthe-counter (OTC) derivative\ninstruments where adjustments\nto reflect counterparty credit\nrisk, own credit risk and term\nfunding risk are required to\nestimate fair value. This\nprincipally includes\nderivatives with a base\nvaluation (e.g., discounted\nusing overnight indexed swap\n(OIS)) requiring adjustment\nfor these effects, such as\nuncollateralized interest rate\nswaps. The CVA represents a\nportfolio-level adjustment to\nreflect the risk premium\nassociated with the\ncounterparty\u2019s (assets) or\nCiti\u2019s (liabilities) non-\nperformance risk. The FVA\nrepresents a market funding\nrisk premium inherent in the\nuncollateralized portion of a\nderivative portfolio and in\ncertain collateralized\nderivative portfolios that do\nnot include standard credit\nsupport annexes (CSAs), such\nas where the CSA does not\npermit the reuse of collateral\nreceived. Citi\u2019s FVA\nmethodology leverages the\nexisting CVA methodology to\nestimate a funding exposure\nprofile. The calculation of\nthis exposure profile\nconsiders collateral\nagreements in which the terms\ndo not permit the Company to\nreuse the collateral received,\nincluding where counterparties\npost collateral to third-party\ncustodians. Citi\u2019s CVA and FVA\nmethodologies consist of two\nsteps: \u2022 First, the exposure\nprofile for each counterparty\nis determined using the terms\nof all individual derivative\npositions and a Monte Carlo\nsimulation or other\nquantitative analysis to\ngenerate a series of expected\ncash flows at future points in\ntime. The calculation of this\nexposure profile considers the\neffect of credit risk\nmitigants and sources of\nfunding, including pledged\ncash or other collateral and\nany legal right of offset that\nexists with a counterparty\nthrough arrangements such as\nnetting agreements. Individual\nderivative contracts that are\nsubject to an enforceable\nmaster netting agreement with\na counterparty are aggregated\nas a netting set for this\npurpose, since it is those net\ncash flows that are subject to\nnonperformance risk. This\nprocess identifies specific,\npoint-in-time future cash\nflows that are subject to\nnonperformance and term\nfunding risk, rather than\nusing the current recognized\nnet asset or liability as a\nbasis to measure the CVA and\nFVA. \u2022 Second, for CVA,\nmarket-based views of default\nprobabilities derived from\nobserved credit spreads in the\ncredit default swap (CDS)\nmarket are applied to the\nexpected future cash flows\ndetermined in step one. Citi\u2019s\n\nown credit CVA is determined\nusing Citi-specific CDS\nspreads for the relevant\ntenor. Generally, counterparty\nCVA is determined using CDS\nspread indices for each credit\nrating and tenor. For certain\nidentified netting sets where\nindividual analysis is\npracticable (e.g., exposures\nto counterparties with liquid\nCDSs), counterparty-specific\nCDS spreads are used. For FVA,\na term structure of spreads is\napplied to the expected\nfunding exposures (e.g., the\nmarket liquidity spread used\nto represent the term funding\npremium associated with\ncertain OTC derivatives). The\nCVA and FVA are designed to\nincorporate a market view of\nthe credit and funding risk,\nrespectively, inherent in the\nderivative portfolio. However,\nmost unsecured derivative\ninstruments are negotiated\nbilateral contracts and are\nnot commonly transferred to\nthird parties. Derivative\ninstruments are normally\nsettled contractually or, if\nterminated early, are\nterminated at a value\nnegotiated bilaterally between\nthe parties. Thus, the CVA and\nFVA may not be realized upon a\nsettlement or termination in\nthe normal course of business.\nIn addition, all or a portion\nof these adjustments may be\nreversed or otherwise adjusted\nin future periods in the event\nof changes in the credit or\nfunding risk associated with\nthe derivative instruments.\nThe table below summarizes the\nCVA and FVA applied to the\nfair value of derivative\ninstruments at December 31,\n2023 and 2022:\n                                                                \n                         Credit and funding                     \n                                  valuation                     \n                                adjustments                     \n                           contra-liability                     \n                             (contra-asset)                     \n  In millions of               December 31,       December 31,  \n  dollars                              2023               2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Counterparty CVA    $                -580    $          -816  \n  Asset FVA                            -562               -622  \n  Citigroup (own                        381                607  \n  credit) CVA                                                   \n  Liability FVA                         255                263  \n  Total CVA and                                                 \n  FVA\u2014derivative      $                -506    $          -568  \n  instruments                                                   \n                                                                \n                              270                               \nThe table below summarizes\npretax gains (losses) related\nto changes in CVA on\nderivative instruments, net of\nhedges, FVA on derivatives and\ndebt valuation adjustments\n(DVA) on Citi\u2019s own fair value\noption (FVO) liabilities for\nthe years indicated:\n                                                                \n                       Credit/funding/\u2026                         \n                              valuation                         \n                       adjustments gain                         \n  In millions of                 (loss)                         \n  dollars                          2023        2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Counterparty      $               -31    $   -227    $    79  \n  CVA                                                           \n  Asset FVA                          64        -102         96  \n  Own credit CVA                   -212         157        -33  \n  Liability FVA                     -23         155        -22  \n  Total CVA and                                                 \n  FVA\u2014derivative    $              -202    $    -17    $   120  \n  instruments                                                   \n  DVA related to                                                \n  own FVO           $            -2,078    $  2,685    $   296  \n  liabilities(1)                                                \n  Total CVA, DVA    $            -2,280    $  2,668    $   416  \n  and FVA                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 21.\nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities\nSold Under Agreements to Repurchase No quoted prices exist for\nthese instruments, since fair value is determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow technique. Cash flows are estimated based\non the terms of the contract, taking into account any embedded\nderivatives or other features. These cash flows are discounted\nusing interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the\ninstrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral.\nGenerally, when such instruments are recorded at fair value,\nthey are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy,\nas the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable.\nHowever, certain long-dated positions are classified within\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Trading Account Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Trading Securities and Trading Loans When available,\nthe Company uses quoted market prices in active markets to\ndetermine the fair value of trading securities; such items are\nclassified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples\ninclude government securities and exchange-traded equity\nsecurities. For bonds and secondary market loans traded over the\ncounter, the Company generally determines fair value utilizing\nvarious valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows,\nprice-based and internal models. Fair value estimates from these\ninternal valuation techniques are verified, where possible, to\nprices obtained from independent sources, including third-party\nvendors. A price-based methodology utilizes, where available,\nquoted prices or other market information obtained from recent\ntrading activity of instruments with similar characteristics to\nthe bond or loan being valued. The yields used in discounted\ncash flow models are derived from the same price information.\nTrading securities and loans priced using such methods are\ngenerally classified as Level 2. However, when the primary\ninputs to the valuation are unobservable, or prices from\nindependent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation, a\nloan or\n\nsecurity is generally classified as Level 3. Fair value\nestimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified,\nwhere possible, to prices obtained from independent sources,\nincluding third-party vendors. When the Company\u2019s principal exit\nmarket for a portfolio of loans is through securitization, the\nCompany uses the securitization price as a key input into the\nfair value of the loan portfolio. The securitization price is\ndetermined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical\nsecuritization within the current market environment. Where such\na price verification is possible, loan portfolios are typically\nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For most\nof the subprime mortgage backed security (MBS) exposures, fair\nvalue is determined utilizing observable transactions where\navailable, or other valuation techniques such as discounted cash\nflow analysis utilizing valuation assumptions derived from\nsimilar, more observable securities as market proxies. The\nvaluation of certain asset-backed security (ABS) CDO positions\nis inferred through the net asset value of the underlying assets\nof the ABS CDO. Trading Account Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Derivatives Exchange-traded derivatives, measured at\nfair value using quoted (i.e., exchange) prices in active\nmarkets, where available, are classified as Level 1 within the\nfair value hierarchy. Derivatives without a quoted price in an\nactive market and derivatives executed over the counter are\nvalued using internal valuation techniques. These derivative\ninstruments are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3\ndepending on the observability of the significant inputs to the\nvaluation. The valuation techniques depend on the type of\nderivative and the nature of the underlying instrument. The\nprincipal techniques used to value these instruments are\ndiscounted cash flows and internal models, such as derivative\npricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo\nsimulations). The key inputs depend upon the type of derivative\nand the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest\nrate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, volatilities and\ncorrelation. Investments The investments category includes\navailable-for-sale debt and marketable equity securities whose\nfair values are generally determined by utilizing similar\nprocedures described for trading securities above or, in some\ncases, using vendor pricing as the primary source. Also included\nin investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and\nreal estate entities. Determining the fair value of nonpublic\nsecurities involves a significant degree of management judgment,\nas no quoted prices exist and such securities are not generally\ntraded. In addition, there may be transfer restrictions on\nprivate equity securities. The Company\u2019s process for determining\nthe fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted\nvaluation techniques, including guideline public company\nanalysis and comparable transactions. In determining the fair\nvalue of nonpublic securities, the Company also considers events\nsuch as a proposed sale of the investee company, initial public\nofferings, equity issuances or other observable transactions.\nPrivate\n                              271                               \nequity securities are\ngenerally classified within\nLevel 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy. Short-Term\nBorrowings and Long-Term Debt\nWhere fair value accounting\nhas been elected, the fair\nvalue of non-structured\nliabilities is determined by\nutilizing internal models\nusing the appropriate discount\nrate for the applicable\nmaturity. Such instruments are\nclassified within Level 2 of\nthe fair value hierarchy when\nall significant inputs are\nreadily observable. The\nCompany determines the fair\nvalue of hybrid financial\ninstruments, including\nstructured liabilities, using\nthe appropriate derivative\nvaluation methodology\n(described above in \u201cTrading\nAccount Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Derivatives\u201d)\ngiven the nature of the\nembedded risk profile. Such\ninstruments are classified\nwithin Level 2 or Level 3\ndepending on the observability\nof significant inputs to the\nvaluation.\n                              272                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

In other instances,\nmarket changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more\nobservable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less\nsignificant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g.,\nwhen an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money) . This\nhas primarily resulted in $ 10.2billion of certain structured\nlong-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level\n2 during the 12 months ended December 31, 2023.

\nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Relating to Unobservable\nInputs Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient\nor dispersed market data to allow a precise determination of the\nexit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today\u2019s\nmarket. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value\ninstruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that\nmay be both unobservable and significant to the instrument\u2019s (or\nportfolio\u2019s) overall fair value measurement. The uncertainties\nassociated with key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements may not be independent of one another. In\naddition, the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair\nvalue measurement for a given change in an unobservable input\ndepends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the\nCompany holds the instrument as an asset or a liability. For\ncertain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk management\nare sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather\nthan on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs.\nThe following section describes some of the most significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements. Correlation Correlation is a measure of the extent\nto which two or more variables change in relation to each other.\nA variety of correlation-related assumptions are required for a\nwide range of instruments, including equity and credit baskets,\nforeign exchange options, Credit Index Tranches and many other\ninstruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations\nare not directly observable in the market and must be calculated\nusing alternative sources, including historical information.\nEstimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may\nvary over time, and calculating correlation information from\nmarket data requires significant assumptions regarding the\ninformational efficiency of the market (e.g., swaption markets).\nUncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate\nlevel of correlation as an input into some fair value\nmeasurements is required. Changes in correlation levels can have\na substantial impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of\nan instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default\ncorrelation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising\na CDO structure would affect the fair value of the senior\ntranche. For example, an increase in the default correlation of\nthe underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior\ntranche, because highly correlated instruments produce greater\nlosses in the event of default and a portion of these losses\nwould become attributable to the senior tranche. That same\nchange in default correlation would have a different impact on\njunior tranches of the same structure. Volatility Volatility\nrepresents the speed and severity of market price changes and is\na key factor in pricing options. Volatility generally depends on\nthe tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or\nlevel defined in the contract. Volatilities for certain\ncombinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to\nbe estimated using alternative methods, such as comparable\ninstruments, historical analysis or other sources of market\ninformation. This leads to uncertainty around the final fair\nvalue measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities.\nThe general relationship between changes in the value of an\ninstrument (or a portfolio) to changes in volatility also\ndepends on changes in interest rates and the level of the\nunderlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets)\nbenefit from increases in volatility, whereas short option\npositions (liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are\nmore sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For\nexample, an at-the-money option would experience a greater\npercentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money\noption. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than\none underlying security (e.g., an option on a basket of\nequities) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying\nsecurities as well as their correlations. Yield In some\ncircumstances, the yield of an instrument is not observable in\nthe market and must be estimated from historical data or from\nyields of similar securities. This estimated yield may need to\nbe adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being\nvalued. Whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to\nthe value of the security, the fair value measurement is\nclassified as Level 3. Adjusted yield is generally used to\ndiscount the projected future principal and interest cash flows\non instruments, such as asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield\nis impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and\nrelevant credit spreads. Prepayment Voluntary unscheduled\npayments (prepayments) change the future cash flows for the\ninvestor and thereby change the fair value of the security. The\neffect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential\nmortgage-backed securities. Prepayment is generally negatively\ncorrelated with delinquency and interest rate. A combination of\nlow prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input\u2019s\nnegative impact on a mortgage security\u2019s valuation. As\nprepayment speeds change, the weighted-average life of the\nsecurity changes, which impacts the valuation either positively\nor negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and the\ndirection of the change in the weighted-average life. Recovery\nRecovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a\nbond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation\nscenario. For many credit securities (e.g., commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities), the expected recovery amount of a defaulted\nproperty is typically unknown until a liquidation of the\nproperty is imminent. The assumed recovery of a security may\ndiffer from its actual recovery that will be observable in the\nfuture. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate assumption\nincreases the fair value of the security. An increase in loss\nseverity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the amount\nof principal available for distribution and, as a result,\ndecreases the fair value of the security.\n                              284                               \nCredit Spread Credit spread is\na component of the security\nrepresenting its credit\nquality. Credit spread\nreflects the market perception\nof changes in prepayment,\ndelinquency and recovery\nrates, therefore capturing the\nimpact of other variables on\nthe fair value. Changes in\ncredit spread affect the fair\nvalue of securities\ndifferently depending on the\ncharacteristics and maturity\nprofile of the security. For\nexample, credit spread is a\nmore significant driver of the\nfair value measurement of a\nhigh-yield bond as compared to\nan investment-grade bond.\nGenerally, the credit spread\nfor an investment-grade bond\nis also more observable and\nless volatile than its high-\nyield counterpart.\n\nItems Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nCertain assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and,\ntherefore, are not included in\nthe tables above. These\ninclude assets measured at\ncost that have been written\ndown to fair value during the\nperiods as a result of an\nimpairment. These also include\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities that have been\nmeasured using the measurement\nalternative and are either (i)\nwritten down to fair value\nduring the periods as a result\nof an impairment or (ii)\nadjusted upward or downward to\nfair value as a result of a\ntransaction observed during\nthe periods for an identical\nor similar investment in the\nsame issuer. In addition,\nthese assets include loans\nheld-for-sale and other real\nestate owned that are measured\nat the lower of cost or market\nvalue.\nThe following tables present\nthe carrying amounts of all\nassets that were still held\nfor which a nonrecurring fair\nvalue measurement was\nrecorded:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                                                       \n  December 31,                                                  \n  2023                  Fair value       Level\u00a02       Level\u00a03  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Loans HFS(1)       $       1,171    $      495    $      676  \n  Other real                     4             \u2014             4  \n  estate owned                                                  \n  Loans(2)                     328             \u2014           328  \n  Non-marketable                                                \n  equity                                                        \n  securities                   359             \u2014           359  \n  measured using                                                \n  the measurement                                               \n  alternative                                                   \n  Total assets at                                               \n  fair value on a    $       1,862    $      495    $    1,367  \n  nonrecurring                                                  \n  basis                                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                                                       \n  December 31,                                                  \n  2022                  Fair value       Level\u00a02       Level\u00a03  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Loans HFS(1)       $       2,336    $      457    $    1,879  \n  Other real                     1             \u2014             1  \n  estate owned                                                  \n  Loans(2)                      69             \u2014            69  \n  Non-marketable                                                \n  equity                                                        \n  securities                   597             \u2014           597  \n  measured using                                                \n  the measurement                                               \n  alternative                                                   \n  Total assets at                                               \n  fair value on a    $       3,003    $      457    $    2,546  \n  nonrecurring                                                  \n  basis                                                         \n                                                                \n(1) Net of mark-to-market\namounts on the unfunded\nportion of loans HFS\nrecognized as Other\nliabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Represents impaired loans\nheld for investment whose\ncarrying amount is based on\nthe fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less\ncosts to sell, primarily real\nestate.\nThe fair value of loans HFS is determined where possible using\nquoted secondary-market prices. If no such quoted price exists,\nthe fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a\nsimilar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of\nthat loan. Fair value for the other real estate owned is based\non appraisals. For loans whose carrying amount is based on the\nfair value of the underlying collateral, the fair values depend\non the type of collateral. Fair value of the collateral is\ntypically estimated based on quoted market prices if available,\nappraisals or other internal valuation techniques. Where the\nfair value of the related collateral is based on an appraised\nvalue, the loan is generally classified as Level 3. In addition,\nfor corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are often\nbased on sales of similar assets; however, because the prices of\nsimilar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the\nunique features of the underlying collateral, these fair value\nmeasurements are generally classified as Level 3. The fair value\nof non-marketable equity securities under the measurement\nalternative is based on observed transaction prices for the\nidentical or similar investment of the same issuer, or an\ninternal valuation technique in the case of an impairment. Where\nthere are insufficient market observations to conclude the\ninputs are observable, where significant adjustments are made to\nthe observed transaction prices or when an internal valuation\ntechnique is used, the security is classified as Level 3. Fair\nvalue may differ from the observed transaction price due to a\nnumber of factors, including marketability adjustments and\ndifferences in rights and obligations when the observed\ntransaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.\n                              285                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Nonrecurring Fair\nValue Measurements\nThe

the carrying value and\nfair value of Citigroup\u2019s financial instruments that are not\ncarried at fair value. The tables below therefore exclude items\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the\ntables above. The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate\ninvestments, pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance\ncontracts and tax-related items. Also, as required, the\ndisclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount\nthat could result from offering for sale at one time the entire\nholdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value\nassociated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other\nexpenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In\naddition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets\nand liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise,\nrelationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full\nassessment of Citigroup\u2019s financial position and the value of\nits net assets. Fair values vary from period to period based on\nchanges in a wide range of factors, including interest rates,\ncredit quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing\nassets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered\ninto.\n                                                                \n            Dec\u2026                   Est\u2026                         \n

Additional discussion regarding other applicable\nareas in which fair value elections were made is presented in\nNote 26.\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value of those\nitems for which the fair value option has been elected:\n                                                                \n                                  Changes in fair               \n                             value\u2014gains (losses)               \n  In millions of              for the years ended               \n  dollars                            December 31,               \n  Assets                                     2023         2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Securities borrowed                                           \n  and purchased under    $                    267    $    -109  \n  agreements to                                                 \n  resell                                                        \n  Trading account                              97         -296  \n  assets                                                        \n  Loans                                                         \n  Certain corporate                         2,038       -1,763  \n  loans                                                         \n  Certain consumer                              6           -1  \n  loans                                                         \n  Total loans            $                  2,044    $  -1,764  \n  Other assets                                                  \n  MSRs                   $                     28    $     201  \n  Certain mortgage                            -23         -455  \n  loans HFS(1)                                                  \n  Total other assets     $                      5    $    -254  \n  Total assets           $                  2,413    $  -2,423  \n  Liabilities                                                   \n  Interest-bearing       $                    -97    $      42  \n  deposits                                                      \n  Securities loaned                                             \n  and sold under                             -217          110  \n  agreements to                                                 \n  repurchase                                                    \n  Trading account                             138         -239  \n  liabilities                                                   \n  Short-term                                  -18        1,424  \n  borrowings(2)                                                 \n  Long-term debt(2)                       -12,998       15,589  \n  Total liabilities      $                -13,192    $  16,926  \n                                                                \n(1) Includes gains (losses) associated with interest rate lock\ncommitments for originated loans for which the Company has\nelected the fair value option.\n(2) Includes DVA that is included in AOCI . See Notes 21 and 26.\n                              288                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 21\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss\nof $ 2,078million and gain of $ 2,685million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in fair value\nresulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were\nestimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads\nobservable in the bond market into the relevant valuation\ntechnique used to value each liability as described above. The\nFair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nSelected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to\nResell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made\nbecause the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio\nbasis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are\naccounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair\nvalue for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . The related interest income and\ninterest expense are measured based on the contractual rates\nspecified in the transactions and are reported as Interest\nincome and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Certain Loans and Other Credit Products Citigroup has\nalso elected the fair value option for certain other originated\nand purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products,\nsuch as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by\nCitigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit\nproducts are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant\ngroups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products\nthat are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near\nterm, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with\nderivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps\nor total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on\nthe underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases\nwhere hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending\ntransactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                Decemb\u2026                                         \n                    31,                   December              \n                   2023                   31, 2022              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026       Trading       Loans        Trading       Loans  \n  of             assets                     assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $    4,518    $  7,594    $     6,011    $  5,360  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess             88          10            167          51  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans               \u2014           1              \u2014           2  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value               \u2014           1              \u2014           1  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 391million and $\n729million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n                              289                               \nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest income is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nincome on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a gain of\n$ 39million and loss of $ 155million, respectively. Changes in\nfair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated\nbased on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and\nrecovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of\nits commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment\nis bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the contract within\nTrading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across\nunallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $\n0.6billion and $ 0.3billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi\ntrades unallocated precious metals investments and executes\nforward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with\ntrading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious\nmetals investment, Citi\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is\nrepaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated\nprecious metal.

At December 31, 2022, $\n1.8billion was held at the National Settlements Depository (NSD)\nand was also subject to restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment. In April 2023, the balances held in the NSD were\ntransferred to the DIA. For the rest of 2023, all balances that\npreviously would have been transferred to the NSD were\ntransferred to the DIA. These restricted amounts are reported\nwithin Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nCollateral At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the approximate fair\nvalue of securities collateral received by Citi that may be\nresold or repledged, excluding the impact of allowable netting,\nwas $ 817.9billion and $ 725.5billion, respectively. This\ncollateral was received in connection with resale agreements,\nsecurities borrowings and loans, securities for securities\nlending transactions, derivative transactions and margined\nbroker loans. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, a substantial\nportion of the collateral received by Citi had been sold or\nrepledged in connection with repurchase agreements, securities\nsold, not yet purchased, securities lendings, pledges to\nclearing organizations, segregation requirements under\nsecurities laws and regulations, derivative transactions and\nbank loans.\n                              292                               \nGuarantees Citi provides a variety of guarantees and\nindemnifications to its customers to enhance their credit\nstanding and enable them to complete a wide range of business\ntransactions. For certain contracts meeting the definition of a\nguarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a\nliability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in\nissuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose\nthe maximum potential amount of future payments that the\nguarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts\nbear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\nThe following tables present information about Citi\u2019s\nguarantees:\n

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n(2) At December 31, 2023 and 2022, this maximum potential\nexposure was estimated to be approximately $ 138billion and $\n130billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants.\n(3) Includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation\nunder the sponsored member repo program.\n                              293                               \nFinancial Standby Letters of Credit Citi issues standby letters\nof credit, which substitute its own credit for that of the\nborrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is\nobligated to repay Citi. Standby letters of credit protect a\nthird party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial\nstandby letters of credit include (i) guarantees of payment of\ninsurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial\nrevenue bond underwriting, (ii) settlement of payment\nobligations to clearing houses, including futures and over-the-\ncounter derivatives clearing (see further discussion below),\n(iii) support options and purchases of securities in lieu of\nescrow deposit accounts and (iv) letters of credit that backstop\nloans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade\nacceptances. Performance Guarantees Performance guarantees and\nletters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer\u2019s tender\nbid on a construction or systems-installation project or to\nguarantee completion of such projects in accordance with\ncontract terms. They are also issued to support a customer\u2019s\nobligation to supply specified products, commodities or\nmaintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative\nInstruments Considered to Be Guarantees Derivatives are\nfinancial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional\namount and an underlying instrument, reference credit or index,\nwhere there is little or no initial investment and whose terms\nrequire or permit net settlement. See Note 24 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities. Derivative instruments\nconsidered to be guarantees include only those instruments that\nrequire Citi to make payments to the counterparty based on\nchanges in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset,\na liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party.\nMore specifically, derivative instruments considered to be\nguarantees include certain over-the-counter written put options\nwhere the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-\ndealer (such counterparties are considered to be dealers in\nthese markets and may, therefore, not hold the underlying\ninstruments). Credit derivatives sold by Citi are excluded from\nthe tables above as they are disclosed separately in Note 24. In\ninstances where Citi\u2019s maximum potential future payment is\nunlimited, the notional amount of the contract is disclosed.\nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts\npresented in the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase\nreserve for its potential repurchases or make-whole liability\nregarding residential mortgage representation and warranty\nclaims related to its whole loan sales to U.S. government-\nsponsored agencies and, to a lesser extent, private investors.\nThe repurchase reserve was approximately $ 11million and $\n10million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and these\namounts are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Securities Lending Indemnifications Owners of\nsecurities frequently lend those securities for a fee to other\nparties who may sell them short or deliver them to another party\nto satisfy some other obligation. Banks may administer such\nsecurities lending programs for their clients. Securities\nlending indemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee\nthat a securities lending customer will be made whole in the\nevent that the security borrower does not return the security\nsubject to the lending agreement and collateral held is\ninsufficient to cover the market value of the security. Credit\nCard Merchant Processing Credit card merchant processing\nguarantees represent the Company\u2019s indirect obligations in\nconnection with (i) providing transaction processing services to\nvarious merchants with respect to its private label cards and\n(ii) potential liability for bank card transaction processing\nservices. The nature of the liability in either case arises as a\nresult of a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder\nthat is ultimately resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor. The\nmerchant is liable to refund the amount to the cardholder. In\ngeneral, if the credit card processing company is unable to\ncollect this amount from the merchant, the credit card\nprocessing company bears the loss for the amount of the credit\nor refund paid to the cardholder. With regard to (i) above, Citi\nhas the primary contingent liability with respect to its\nportfolio of private label merchants. The risk of loss is\nmitigated as the cash flows between Citi and the merchant are\nsettled on a net basis, and Citi has the right to offset any\npayments with cash flows otherwise due to the merchant. To\nfurther mitigate this risk, Citi may delay settlement, require a\nmerchant to make an escrow deposit, include event triggers to\nprovide Citi with more financial and operational control in the\nevent of the financial deterioration of the merchant or require\nvarious credit enhancements (including letters of credit and\nbank guarantees). In the unlikely event that a private label\nmerchant is unable to deliver products, services or a refund to\nits private label cardholders, Citi is contingently liable to\ncredit or refund cardholders. With regard to (ii) above, Citi\nhas a potential liability for bank card transactions where Citi\nprovides the transaction processing services as well as those\nwhere a third party provides the services and Citi acts as a\nsecondary guarantor, should that processor fail to perform.\nCiti\u2019s maximum potential contingent liability related to both\nbank card and private label merchant processing services is\nestimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions\nthat meet the requirements to be valid charge-back transactions\nat any given time. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be $ 138.0billion and $\n129.6billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned\n                              294                               \nto merchants. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its\ncontingent liability related to merchant processing based on the\nfinancial strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and\nnature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss\nexperience. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the losses incurred\nand the carrying amounts of Citi\u2019s contingent obligations\nrelated to merchant processing activities were immaterial.\nCredit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of its\ncredit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide coverage for certain losses\nassociated with purchased products, and protection for certain\ntravel-related purchases. These guarantees are not included in\nthe table, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees\nand Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the actual and\nestimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi\u2019s\nobligations related to these programs were immaterial. Other\nRepresentation and Warranty Indemnifications In the normal\ncourse of business, Citi provides standard representations and\nwarranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with\nnumerous transactions and also provides indemnifications,\nincluding indemnifications that protect the counterparties to\nthe contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed, due\neither to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation\nof the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide\nCiti with comparable indemnifications. While such\nrepresentations, warranties and indemnifications are essential\ncomponents of many contractual relationships, they do not\nrepresent the underlying business purpose for the transactions.\nThe indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms\nrelated to Citi\u2019s own performance under the terms of a contract\nand are entered into in the normal course of business based on\nan assessment that the risk of loss is remote. Often these\nclauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met\nat inception. Nocompensation is received for these standard\nrepresentations and warranties, and it is not possible to\ndetermine their fair value because they rarely, if ever, result\nin a payment. In many cases, there are nostated or notional\namounts included in the indemnification clauses, and the\ncontingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify\nhave not occurred and are not expected to occur. As a result,\nthese indemnifications are not included in the tables above.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 or 2022 for potential\nobligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement with VTN\nassociations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification In 2000,\nTravelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary of Citi,\nentered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and\nrewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE Life (now\nGenworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a subsidiary of the\nGeneral Electric Company (GE). As part of this transaction, the\nreinsurance obligations were provided by two regulated insurance\nsubsidiaries of GE Life, which funded twocollateral trusts with\nsecurities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are\nreferred to as the Genworth Trusts. As part of GE\u2019s spin-off of\nGenworth in 2004, GE retained the risks and rewards associated\nwith the 2000 Travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a\nreinsurance contract to Genworth through GE\u2019s Union Fidelity\nLife Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the\nTravelers LTC policies. In addition, GE provided a capital\nmaintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC that is designed to\nassure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay its reinsurance\nobligations. As a result of these reinsurance agreements and the\nspin-off of Genworth, Genworth has reinsurance protection from\nUFLIC (supported by GE) and has reinsurance obligations in\nconnection with the Travelers LTC policies. As noted below, the\nGenworth reinsurance obligations now benefit Brighthouse\nFinancial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While neither Brighthouse nor\nCiti are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance\nagreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit\nindirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance\nagreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will continue to have\nfunds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to Genworth.\nIn connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of Travelers to MetLife Inc.\n(MetLife), Citi provided an indemnification to MetLife for\nlosses (including policyholder claims) relating to\n                              295                               \nthe LTC business for the entire term of the Travelers LTC\npolicies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries\nof Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance\nbusiness to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers LTC policies\nnow reside with Brighthouse. The original reinsurance agreement\nbetween Travelers (now Brighthouse) and Genworth remains in\nplace and Brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the Genworth\nTrusts. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide collateral\nto Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities\nof Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC policies. The\nassets in the Genworth Trusts are evaluated and adjusted\nperiodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets\ncontinues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these\nestimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change over\ntime. If both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original\nTravelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason,\nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the two\nGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022 related to this indemnification. However, if both\nevents become reasonably possible (meaning more than remote but\nless than probable), Citi will be required to estimate and\ndisclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the\nextent that such an estimate could be made. In addition, if both\nevents become probable, Citi will be required to accrue for such\nliability in accordance with applicable accounting principles.\nFutures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides\nclearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients\nthat need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and\ncircumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for\naccounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these\nclient transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the\nunderlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. See Note 24 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities that are reflected in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. As a clearing member, Citi\ncollects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin)\nbetween its clients and the respective CCP. In certain\ncircumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or\nsecurities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs.\nThis excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as\nbanks or carry brokers. There are twotypes of margin: initial\nand variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash\ninitial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial\nmargin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or\ndepository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables\n(payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and\ndue from banks , respectively. However, for exchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain\nbenefits from or control the client cash balances, the client\ncash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the\nCCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi\nhas contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 17.8billion and $ 18.0billion as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. Variation margin due from clients\nto the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts for\neach trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the\nrisk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to\npost variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the\nvalue of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of\nnon-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event\nthat the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. FICC Sponsored\nMember Repo Program Citi acts as a sponsoring member of the\nGovernment Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (FICC) to clear eligible resale and repurchase\nagreements on behalf of its clients that become sponsored\nmembers of the FICC. Citi, as sponsoring member, is required to\nprovide a guarantee to the FICC with respect to the prompt\npayment and performance of its sponsored members. Because Citi\nobtains a security interest in the cash or high-quality\nsecurities collateral that the clients place with the clearing\nhouse, Citi expects the risk of loss from this guarantee to be\nremote. See Note 12 for additional information on Citi\u2019s resale\nand repurchase agreements, including risk mitigation practices\nfor these transactions. Carrying Value\u2014Guarantees and\nIndemnifications At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total\ncarrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees\nand indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to\napproximately $ 1.2billion and $ 1.4billion, respectively. The\ncarrying value of financial and performance guarantees is\nincluded in Other liabilities. For loans sold with recourse, the\ncarrying value of the liability is included in Other liabilities\n.\n                              296                               \nCollateral Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses\nrealized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to\n$ 52.5billion and $ 51.8billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 67.7billion and $ 63.7billion at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities\nlending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in\nfavor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 3.1billion and $\n3.7billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other\nproperty may also be available to Citi to cover losses under\ncertain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of\nsuch property has not been determined. Performance Risk Citi\nevaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the\nassigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be Baa/BBB and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. On certain\nunderlying referenced assets or entities, ratings are not\navailable. Such referenced assets are included in the \u201cnot\nrated\u201d category. The maximum potential amount of the future\npayments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to\nbe the notional amount of these contracts, which is the par\namount of the assets guaranteed. Presented in the tables below\nare the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are\nclassified based on internal and external credit ratings. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts\nbear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

business HFS countries\nunder sales agreements are reflected in their original\ncategories until the respective sales are completed.\n(2) Other commitments and contingencies include commitments to\npurchase certain debt and equity securities.\nThe majority of unused\ncommitments are contingent\nupon customers maintaining\nspecific credit standards.\nCommercial commitments\ngenerally have floating\ninterest rates and fixed\nexpiration dates and may\nrequire payment of fees. Such\nfees (net of certain direct\ncosts) are deferred and, upon\nexercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the\nloan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the\ncommitment period. Commercial\nand Similar Letters of Credit\nA commercial letter of credit\nis an instrument by which\nCitigroup substitutes its\ncredit for that of a customer\nto enable the customer to\nfinance the purchase of goods\nor to incur other commitments.\nCitigroup issues a letter on\nbehalf of its client to a\nsupplier and agrees to pay the\nsupplier upon presentation of\ndocumentary evidence that the\nsupplier has performed in\naccordance with the terms of\nthe letter of credit. When a\nletter of credit is drawn, the\ncustomer is then required to\nreimburse Citigroup. One- to\nFour-Family Residential\nMortgages A one- to four-\nfamily residential mortgage\ncommitment is a written\nconfirmation from Citigroup to\na seller of a property that\nthe bank will advance the\nspecified sums enabling the\nbuyer to complete the\npurchase. Revolving Open-End\nLoans Secured by One- to Four-\nFamily Residential Properties\nRevolving open-end loans\nsecured by one- to four-family\nresidential properties are\nessentially home equity lines\nof credit. A home equity line\nof credit is a loan secured by\na primary residence or second\nhome to the extent of the\nexcess of fair market value\nover the debt outstanding for\nthe first mortgage. Commercial\nReal Estate, Construction and\nLand Development Commercial\nreal estate, construction and\nland development include\nunused portions of commitments\nto extend credit for the\npurpose of financing\ncommercial and multifamily\nresidential properties as well\nas land development projects.\n\nBoth secured-by-real-estate\nand unsecured commitments are\nincluded in this line, as well\nas undistributed loan\nproceeds, where there is an\nobligation to advance for\nconstruction progress\npayments. However, this line\nonly includes those extensions\nof credit that, once funded,\nwill be classified as Total\nloans, net on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Credit Card\nLines Citigroup provides\ncredit to customers by issuing\ncredit cards. The credit card\nlines are cancelable by\nproviding notice to the\ncardholder or without such\nnotice as permitted by local\nlaw. Commercial and Other\nConsumer Loan Commitments\nCommercial and other consumer\nloan commitments include\noverdraft and liquidity\nfacilities as well as\ncommercial commitments to make\nor purchase loans, purchase\nthird-party receivables,\nprovide note issuance or\nrevolving underwriting\nfacilities and invest in the\nform of equity. Other\nCommitments As a Federal\nReserve member bank, Citi is\nrequired to subscribe to half\nof a certain amount of shares\nissued by its Federal Reserve\nDistrict Bank. As of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, Citi holds\nshares with a carrying value\nof $ 4.5billion, with the\nremaining half subject to call\nby the Federal Reserve\nDistrict Bank Board. In the\nnormal course of business,\nCitigroup enters into reverse\nrepurchase and securities\nborrowing agreements, as well\nas repurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022,\nCitigroup had approximately $\n120.9billion and $\n111.6billion of unsettled\nreverse repurchase and\nsecurities borrowing\nagreements, and approximately\n$ 96.4billion and $\n37.3billion of unsettled\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements,\nrespectively. See Note 12 for\na further discussion of\nsecurities purchased under\nagreements to resell and\nsecurities borrowed, and\nsecurities sold under\nagreements to repurchase and\nsecurities loaned, including\nthe Company\u2019s policy for\noffsetting repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements.\nThese amounts are not included\nin the table above.\n                              298                               \n29. LEASES\n\nThe Company\u2019s operating\nleases, where Citi is a\nlessee, include real estate,\nsuch as office space and\nbranches, and various types of\nequipment.

ASC 450 defines a \u201closs contingency\u201d as \u201can existing\ncondition, situation, or set of circumstances involving\nuncertainty as to possible loss to an entity that will\nultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or\nfail to occur.\u201d It imposes different requirements for the\nrecognition and disclosure of loss contingencies based on the\nlikelihood of occurrence of the contingent future event or\nevents. It distinguishes among degrees of likelihood using the\nfollowing three terms: \u201cprobable,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe future\nevent or events are likely to occur\u201d; \u201cremote,\u201d meaning that\n\u201cthe chance of the future event or events occurring is slight\u201d;\nand \u201creasonably possible,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe chance of the\nfuture event or events occurring is more than remote but less\nthan likely.\u201d These three terms are used below as defined in ASC\n450. Accruals . ASC 450 requires accrual for a loss contingency\nwhen it is \u201cprobable that one or more future events will occur\nconfirming the fact of loss\u201d and \u201cthe amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated.\u201d In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup\nestablishes accruals for contingencies, including any\nlitigation, regulatory or tax matters disclosed herein, when\nCitigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When the\nreasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts,\nthe minimum amount of the range is accrued, unless some higher\namount within the range is a better estimate than any other\namount within the range. Once established, accruals are adjusted\nfrom time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional\ninformation. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation\nto those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the\namounts accrued for those matters. Disclosure . ASC 450 requires\ndisclosure of a loss contingency if \u201cthere is at least a\nreasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may\nhave been incurred\u201d and there is no accrual for the loss because\nthe conditions described above are not met or an exposure to\nloss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In accordance with\nASC 450, if Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because\nCitigroup believes that a loss is reasonably possible but not\nprobable, or that a loss is probable but not reasonably\nestimable, and the reasonably possible loss is material, it\ndiscloses the loss contingency. In addition, Citigroup discloses\nmatters for which it has accrued if it believes a reasonably\npossible exposure to material loss exists in excess of the\namount accrued. In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure includes an estimate of the reasonably possible loss\nor range of loss for those matters as to which an estimate can\nbe made. ASC 450 does not require disclosure of an estimate of\nthe reasonably possible loss or range of loss where an estimate\ncannot be made. Neither accrual nor disclosure is required for\nlosses that are deemed remote.\n\nLitigation, Regulatory, and Other Contingencies Overview. In\naddition to the matters described below, in the ordinary course\nof business, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and\ncurrent and former officers, directors, and employees (for\npurposes of this section, sometimes collectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties) routinely are named as defendants\nin, or as parties to, various legal actions and proceedings.\nCertain of these actions and proceedings assert claims or seek\nrelief in connection with alleged violations of consumer\nprotection, fair lending, securities, banking, antifraud,\nantitrust, anti-money laundering, employment, and other\nstatutory and common laws. Certain of these actual or threatened\nlegal actions and proceedings include claims for substantial or\nindeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or for\ninjunctive relief, and in some instances seek recovery on a\nclass-wide basis. In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup\nand Related Parties also are subject to governmental and\nregulatory examinations, information-gathering requests,\ninvestigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal),\ncertain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements,\nfines, penalties, restitution, disgorgement, injunctions or\nother relief. In addition, certain affiliates and subsidiaries\nof Citigroup are banks, registered broker-dealers, futures\ncommission merchants, investment advisors or other regulated\nentities and, in those capacities, are subject to regulation by\nvarious U.S., state, and foreign securities, banking, commodity\nfutures, consumer protection, and other regulators. In\nconnection with formal and informal inquiries by these\nregulators, Citigroup and such affiliates and subsidiaries\nreceive numerous requests, subpoenas, and orders seeking\ndocuments, testimony, and other information in connection with\nvarious aspects of their regulated activities. From time to time\nCitigroup and Related Parties also receive grand jury subpoenas\nand other requests for information or assistance, formal or\ninformal, from federal or state law enforcement agencies\nincluding, among others, various United States Attorneys\u2019\nOffices, the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section and\nother divisions of the Department of Justice, the Financial\nCrimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of\nthe Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation relating\nto Citigroup and its customers. Because of the global scope of\nCitigroup\u2019s operations and its presence in countries around the\nworld, Citigroup and Related Parties are subject to litigation\nand governmental and regulatory examinations, information-\ngathering requests, investigations, and proceedings (both formal\nand informal) in multiple jurisdictions with legal, regulatory,\nand tax regimes that may differ substantially, and present\nsubstantially different risks, from those Citigroup and Related\nParties are subject to in the United States. In some instances,\nCitigroup and Related Parties may be involved in proceedings\ninvolving the same subject matter in multiple jurisdictions,\nwhich may result in overlapping, cumulative or inconsistent\noutcomes. Citigroup seeks to resolve all litigation, regulatory,\ntax, and other matters in the manner management believes is in\nthe best interests of Citigroup and its shareholders, and\ncontests liability, allegations of wrongdoing, and, where\napplicable, the amount of damages or scope of any penalties or\nother relief sought as appropriate in each pending matter.\n                              300                               \nInherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed. Certain of the\nmatters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or\nindeterminate damages. The claims asserted in these matters\ntypically are broad, often spanning a multiyear period and\nsometimes a wide range of business activities, and the\nplaintiffs\u2019 or claimants\u2019 alleged damages frequently are not\nquantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement\nof claim. Other matters relate to regulatory investigations or\nproceedings, as to which there may be no objective basis for\nquantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or other\nremedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the\nloss in such matters, even if it believes that a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case,\nproceeding or investigation have yielded additional information\nsufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of\nreasonably possible loss. Such developments may include, among\nother things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties,\nrulings by the court on key issues, analysis by retained\nexperts, and engagement in settlement negotiations. Depending on\na range of factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the\nnovelty of the legal theories, the pace of discovery, the\ncourt\u2019s scheduling order, the timing of court decisions, and the\nadverse party\u2019s, regulator\u2019s or other authority\u2019s willingness to\nnegotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it may be months or\nyears after the filing of a case or commencement of a proceeding\nor an investigation before an estimate of the range of\nreasonably possible loss can be made. Matters as to Which an\nEstimate Can Be Made . For some of the matters disclosed below,\nCitigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For\nsome of the matters included within this estimation, an accrual\nhas been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and\nreasonably estimable, but a reasonably possible exposure to loss\nexists in excess of the amount accrued. In these cases, the\nestimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in\nexcess of the accrued amount. For other matters included within\nthis estimation, no accrual has been made because a loss,\nalthough estimable, is believed to be reasonably possible, but\nnot probable; in these cases, the estimate reflects the\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss. As of December 31,\n2023, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued\nloss for these matters ranges up to approximately $1.3 billion\nin the aggregate. These estimates are based on currently\navailable information. As available information changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and\nthe estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many\nestimates presented in financial statements and other financial\ndisclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably\npossible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, and tax\nproceedings are subject to particular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making an estimate, (i) Citigroup may\nhave only preliminary, incomplete or inaccurate information\nabout the facts underlying the claim, (ii) its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the court, other tribunal or authority on\nsignificant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse\nparties, regulators or other authorities, may prove to be wrong\nand (iii) the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not\namenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative\nanalytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may\noccur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate\nbecause it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all of\nthese reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued\nin relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included\nin the estimate. Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made\n. For other matters disclosed below, Citigroup is not currently\nable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.\nMany of these matters remain in very preliminary stages (even in\nsome cases where a substantial period of time has passed since\nthe commencement of the matter), with few or no substantive\nlegal decisions by the court, tribunal or other authority\ndefining the scope of the claims, the class (if any) or the\npotentially available damages or other exposure, and fact\ndiscovery is still in progress or has not yet begun. In many of\nthese matters, Citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or\nstatement of claim or asserted its defenses, nor has it engaged\nin any negotiations with the adverse party (whether a regulator,\ntaxing authority or private party). For all these reasons,\nCitigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss, if any, for these matters. Opinion of\nManagement as to Eventual Outcome. Subject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s management, based on current\nknowledge and after taking into account its current accruals,\nthat the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note\nwould not likely have a material adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless,\ngiven the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain\nof these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could,\nfrom time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular\nquarterly or annual periods. FDIC Special Assessment On November\n29, 2023, the FDIC published a final rule implementing a special\nassessment\u2014primarily on large banks\u2014to recover the uninsured\ndeposit losses from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and\nSignature Bank. The FDIC estimated the total cost of the\nfailures to be approximately $16.3 billion, which is\nattributable to the protection of uninsured depositors, an\nestimate that will be periodically adjusted when warranted. The\nFDIC will collect the special assessment at an annual rate of\napproximately 13.44 basis points of December 31, 2022 estimated\nuninsured deposits exceeding $5 billion, over eight quarterly\nassessment periods beginning in 2024. In the fourth quarter of\n2023, Citi accrued an estimated liability of $1.7 billion within\nOther liabilities and reported the corresponding expense in\nOther operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income\nfor the special assessment.\n                              301                               \nForeign Exchange Litigation In 2015, a putative class of\nconsumers and businesses in the U.S. who directly purchased\nsupracompetitive foreign currency at benchmark exchange rates\nfiled an action against Citigroup and other defendants,\ncaptioned NYPL v.

Additional information concerning this action\nis publicly available in court filings under the docket numbers\n20-CV-5832 (N.D. Cal.)

This proceeding is\ncaptioned IN RE PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND MERCHANT\nDISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The plaintiffs, merchants that\naccept Visa and MasterCard branded payment cards, as well as\nvarious membership associations that claim to represent certain\ngroups of merchants, allege, among other things, that defendants\nhave engaged in conspiracies to set the price of interchange and\nmerchant discount fees on credit and debit card transactions and\nto restrain trade unreasonably through various Visa and\nMasterCard rules governing merchant conduct, all in violation of\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act and certain California statutes.\nPlaintiffs further allege violations of Section 2 of the Sherman\nAct. Supplemental complaints also were filed against defendants\nin the putative class actions alleging that Visa\u2019s and\nMasterCard\u2019s respective initial public offerings were\nanticompetitive and violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and\nthat MasterCard\u2019s initial public offering constituted a\nfraudulent conveyance. In 2014, the district court entered a\nfinal judgment approving the terms of a class settlement.\nVarious objectors appealed from the final class settlement\napproval order to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. In 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the\ndistrict court\u2019s approval of the class settlement and remanded\nfor further proceedings. The district court thereafter appointed\nseparate interim counsel for a putative class seeking damages\nand a putative class seeking injunctive relief. Amended or new\ncomplaints on behalf of the putative classes and various\nindividual merchants were subsequently filed, including a\nfurther amended complaint on behalf of a putative damages class\nand a new complaint on behalf of a putative injunctive class,\nboth of which named Citigroup, Citibank, and Citicorp LLC. In\naddition, numerous merchants have filed amended or new\ncomplaints against Visa, MasterCard, and in some instances one\nor more issuing banks, including Citigroup, Citibank, and\nCiticorp Payment Services. In 2019, the district court granted\nthe damages class plaintiffs\u2019 motion for final approval of a new\nsettlement with the defendants. The settlement involves the\ndamages class only and does not settle the claims of the\ninjunctive relief class or any actions brought on a non-class\nbasis by individual merchants. The settlement provides for a\ncash payment to the damages class of $ 6.24billion, later\nreduced by $ 700million based on the transaction volume of class\nmembers that opted out from the settlement. Several merchants\nand merchant groups have appealed the final approval order. On\nSeptember 27, 2021, the court granted the injunctive relief\nclass plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify a non-opt-out class. On\nMarch 15, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s final approval of\nthe damages class settlement and remanded the case back to the\ntrial court for administration of the settlement claims process.\nOn January 8, 2024, the district court issued decisions on two\npending motions for summary judgment. It granted in part and\ndenied in part defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The\ndistrict court also denied Mastercard\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment as to Mastercard\u2019s lack of market power. Other motions\nfor summary judgment remain pending.

These actions have been consolidated in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York\nunder the caption IN RE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ANTITRUST\nLITIGATION. The actions allege that defendants colluded to\nprevent the development of exchange-like trading for IRS and\nassert federal and state antitrust claims and claims for unjust\nenrichment. Also consolidated under the same caption are\nindividual actions filed by swap execution facilities, asserting\nfederal and state antitrust claims, as well as claims for unjust\nenrichment and tortious interference with business relations.\nPlaintiffs in these actions seek treble damages, fees, costs,\nand injunctive relief. Lead plaintiffs in the class action moved\nfor class certification in 2019 and subsequently filed an\namended complaint.

On August 14, 2023, the court granted defendants\u2019\nmotion to dismiss with prejudice for all claims against\nCitigroup, Citibank, CGMI, and CGML. On January 10, 2024,\nplaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Additional information\nconcerning this action is publicly available in court filings\nunder the docket number 17-CV-4302 (S.D.N.Y.)

In September 2022,\nCGML, Citibank (Switzerland) AG, Citibank, NA London, and\nCitivic Nominees Ltd. moved for leave to appeal the district\ncourt\u2019s decision permitting the single claim to proceed against\nthem.

In March 2022, the court granted\ndefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint as to\ncertain defendants, but denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as\nto other defendants, including CGMI and CGML. In November 2022,\nplaintiffs moved for leave to amend the complaint, which the\ncourt granted on September 25, 2023. On October 16, 2023,\nplaintiffs filed a fifth amended complaint. Additional\ninformation concerning this action is publicly available in\ncourt filings under the docket number 19-CV-2601 (S.D.N.Y.)\n(Marrero, J.). Variable Rate Demand Obligation Litigation In\n2019, plaintiffs in the consolidated actions CITY OF\nPHILADELPHIA v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP, ET AL. and MAYOR AND CITY\nCOUNCIL OF BALTIMORE v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP., ET AL. filed a\nconsolidated complaint naming as defendants Citigroup, Citibank,\nCGMI, CGML, and numerous other industry participants. The\nconsolidated complaint asserts violations of the Sherman Act, as\nwell as claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty,\nand unjust enrichment, and seeks damages and injunctive relief\nbased on allegations that defendants served as remarketing\nagents for municipal bonds called variable rate demand\nobligations (VRDOs) and colluded to set artificially high VRDO\ninterest rates. On November 6, 2020, the court granted in part\nand denied in part defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the\nconsolidated complaint. On June 2, 2021, the Board of Directors\nof the San Diego Association of Governments, acting as the San\nDiego County Regional Transportation Commission, filed a\nparallel putative class action against the same defendants named\nin the already pending nationwide consolidated class action. The\ntwo actions were consolidated and on August 6, 2021, plaintiffs\nin the nationwide putative class action filed a consolidated\namended complaint, captioned THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, MAYOR AND\nCITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SAN\nDIEGO ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS, ACTING AS THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY\nREGIONAL TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP., ET\nAL. In September 2021, defendants moved to dismiss the\nconsolidated amended complaint in part. In June 2022, the court\ngranted in part and denied in part defendants\u2019 partial motion to\ndismiss the consolidated amended complaint. In October 2022,\nplaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class of persons and\nentities who, from February 2008 to November 2015, paid interest\nrates on VRDOs with respect to the antitrust claim. Plaintiffs\nalso moved to certify a subclass of individuals who entered into\nremarketing agreements with the defendants during that same\nperiod. On September 21, 2023, the court granted plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion for class certification, certifying both an antitrust\nclass and a breach-of-contract subclass. On October 5, 2023,\ndefendants filed a Rule 23(f) petition seeking leave to appeal\nthe certification ruling. On November 8, 2023, the court\ndismissed certain defendants from the case, including Citigroup,\nCitibank, and CGML. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit heard oral argument on defendants\u2019 Rule 23(f)\npetition on January 23, 2024.
