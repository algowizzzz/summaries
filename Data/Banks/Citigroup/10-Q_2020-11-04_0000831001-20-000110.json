\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThird Quarter of 2020\u2014Results\nReflected Solid Performance\nand Continued Financial\nStrength and Operational\nResilience Despite a\nChallenging Macroeconomic\nEnvironment\n\nAs described further\nthroughout this Executive\nSummary, during the third\nquarter of 2020, Citi\ndemonstrated solid performance\nand continued financial\nstrength and operational\nresilience, despite continued\nweakness in economic\nconditions during the quarter\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s revenues were\nimpacted by the challenging\nenvironment, declining 7% from\nthe prior-year period, as\nstrong performance in fixed\nincome markets, investment\nbanking, equity markets and\nthe private bank in\nInstitutional Clients Group\n(ICG) was more than offset by\nlower revenues in Global\nConsumer Banking (GCB) ,\nreflecting declines across all\nregions, and lower revenues in\nCorporate/Other .\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s results included a\n$400 million civil money\npenalty, recorded in expenses\nin Corporate/Other , in\nconnection with a consent\norder Citibank entered into\nwith the Office of the\nComptroller of the

Consumer net credit\nlosses of $1.6 billion\ndecreased 12%, primarily\nreflecting lower loan volumes\ngiven higher payment rates and\nlower spending activity, as\nwell as the benefits of relief\nprograms. Corporate net credit\nlosses increased from $110\nmillion to $325 million,\nprimarily driven by write-offs\nacross various sectors, and\nwere largely offset by the\nrelease of previously\nestablished ACL reserves.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs and ACL, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital ratio was 11.8% as\nof September 30, 2020, based\non the Basel III Advanced\nApproaches framework for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets, compared to 11.6% as\nof September 30, 2019, based\non the Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets.

The\ntable below shows Citi\u2019s\noutstanding corporate loan\nmodifications, excluding TDRs.\nApproximately $1.4 billion of\nthe $8.2 billion presented\nbelow relates to modifications\nprovided in the third quarter.\n                                                                \n                     September 30,                              \n                              2020                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In millions         Total credit       Funded       Unfunded  \n  of dollars              exposure                              \n  Corporate       $          6,127    $   5,305    $       822  \n  loans                                                         \n  Private bank               2,117        2,105             12  \n  loans                                                         \n  Total           $          8,244    $   7,410    $       834  \n  corporate                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Management of COVID-19 Pandemic Risks Citi\u2019s dedicated\ncontinuity of business and crisis management groups are managing\nCiti\u2019s protocols in response to the pandemic. Among other\nthings, the protocols address the prioritization of critical\nprocessing; ability of staff and third parties to support these\nprocesses from remote work locations; deployment of new hardware\nto support technology needs; and ongoing monitoring to assess\ncontrols and service levels. For additional information about\nCiti\u2019s management of pandemic-related risks, see Citi\u2019s First\nQuarter of 2020 Form 10-Q. For the remainder of 2020, Citi\nexpects that overall revenues, including GCB , ICG and\nCorporate/Other revenues, will likely continue to be adversely\nimpacted by the lower interest rate environment. GCB and ICG\nrevenues will also be affected by the challenging macroeconomic\nand market conditions, including the effects related to the\nseverity and duration of the pandemic as well as the responses\nof governments, customers and clients. In particular, each GCB\nregion is expected to continue to experience the adverse impacts\nfrom the pandemic on customer activity, including lower card\npurchase sales and loan volumes, while Latin America GCB is also\nlikely to continue to experience a more pronounced impact from\nmacroeconomic weakness in Mexico. Citi also expects that ICG\nMarkets and investment banking revenues will continue to reflect\noverall market conditions, including a normalization of business\ntrends compared to the first nine months of 2020 and a seasonal\ndecline in the fourth quarter. In addition, Citi expects to\nincur higher expenses, as it continues to accelerate its\ninvestments in infrastructure, risk management and controls,\nincluding its efforts to improve the risk and control\nenvironment, as well as to comply with the consent orders (see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d above). Citi\u2019s expenses will also be\nimpacted by uncertainties related to the pandemic, including its\ncontinued efforts to protect and support employees and to\nsupport customers and clients digitally. Moreover, in the near\nterm, Citi expects to experience net credit losses similar to\nthe third quarter of 2020, although this may vary by business\nand region and is dependent on future macroeconomic conditions.\nIf Citi\u2019s third quarter of 2020 macroeconomic forecast\nassumptions are realized, the Company does not expect additional\nreserve builds on its existing portfolios (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below); however, the overall level of\nreserves remains dependent on the evolving economic and public\nhealth environments relative to this forecast, as well as new\nlending volumes.

Citigroup\nresubmitted its capital plan\non November 2, 2020.\n\nThrough the end of the fourth\nquarter of 2020, share\nrepurchases continue to be\nprohibited and dividends\ncontinue to be capped and tied\nto a formula based on recent\nincome. These limitations on\ncapital distributions may be\nextended by the FRB.\n\nCiti declared common dividends\nof $0.51 per share for the\nfourth quarter of 2020 on\nOctober 22, 2020, which was\nnot impacted by the FRB\u2019s\ntemporary limitations on\ncapital distributions. For\nadditional information about\nthe capital plan resubmission\nand related limitations on\ncapital distributions, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below.\n\nCertain Key Government Actions\nin Support of the Economy\n                                                                \n  U.S. Government-Sponsored Liquidity Programs                  \n                                                                \nDuring the first quarter of\n2020, the FRB introduced\nseveral liquidity facilities\nin response to the funding\nmarket volatility caused by\nthe pandemic. Citi has\nparticipated in several of the\nU.S. government-sponsored\nliquidity programs, including\nthe Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility (MMLF), the\nPrimary Dealer Credit Facility\n(PDCF) and Discount Window\n(DW) in order to facilitate\nclient activity and support\nthe FRB actions to provide\nadditional liquidity into the\nmarket. Citi has also\nparticipated in the Paycheck\nProtection Program Lending\nFacility (PPPLF), which was\nestablished to facilitate\nlending under the SBA\u2019s\nPaycheck Protection Program\n(see \u201cSmall Business\nAdministration\u2019s Paycheck\nProtection Program\u201d below).\nThe amounts Citi sourced from\nthese facilities were not\nsignificant to Citi\u2019s overall\nliquidity profile during the\nthird quarter, which remains\nstrong and highly liquid. For\nadditional information about\nCiti\u2019s liquidity resources,\nsee \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  U.S. Banking Agencies Regulatory Capital Relief               \n                                                                \nIn response to the pandemic,\nthroughout 2020, the U.S.\nbanking agencies issued\nseveral final rules and\ninterim final rules revising\nthe current regulatory capital\nstandards, to provide banking\norganizations with additional\nflexibility to support\nconsumers and businesses.\nThose rules applicable to Citi\ninclude:\n\n\u2022 Easing of capital\ndistribution limits in the\nevent of regulatory capital\nbuffer breaches, which\nprovides some flexibility to\ncontinue distributing capital\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Modification of the CECL\ntransition provision to defer\nthe January 1, 2020 capital\nimpact to January 1, 2022 and\nto provide additional capital\nrelief for ongoing increases\nin credit reserves. Citi\u2019s\nreported Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio at September 30,\n2020, reflecting the\n\nmodified CECL transition\nprovision, was 43 basis points\nhigher than Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio,\nreflecting the full impact of\nCECL on regulatory capital.\n\n\u2022 Temporary Supplementary\nLeverage ratio (SLR) relief\nfor bank holding companies,\ncommencing in the second\nquarter of 2020, allowing\nCitigroup to temporarily\nexpand its balance sheet by\nexcluding U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits with\nthe FRB from the SLR\ndenominator. Citigroup\u2019s\nreported Supplementary\nLeverage ratio of 6.83%\nbenefited 103 basis points\nduring the third quarter of\n2020 as a result of the\ntemporary relief. Excluding\nthe temporary relief,\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio would have been\n5.80%, compared with a 5.0%\neffective minimum requirement.\n\n\u2022 Assigning a 0% risk weight\nto loans originated under the\nPaycheck Protection Program.\n\nFor additional information\nabout regulatory capital\nrelief provided by the U.S.\nbanking agencies, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) Relief                      \n                                                                \nUnder U.S. GAAP, banks are\nrequired to assess\nmodifications to a loan\u2019s\nterms for potential\nclassification as a TDR. A\nloan to a borrower\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty is classified as a\nTDR when a lender grants a\nconcession that it would\notherwise not consider, such\nas a payment deferral or\ninterest concession. In order\nto encourage banks to work\nwith impacted borrowers, the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act (CARES\nAct) and U.S. banking agencies\nhave provided relief from TDR\naccounting. The main benefits\nof TDR relief include a\ncapital benefit in the form of\nreduced risk-weighted assets,\nas TDRs are more heavily risk-\nweighted for capital purposes;\naging of the loans is frozen,\ni.e., they will continue to be\nreported in the same\ndelinquency bucket they were\nin at the time of\nmodification; and the loans\nare generally not reported as\nnon-accrual during the\nmodification period. The loans\nincluded in Citi\u2019s pandemic\nconsumer relief programs are\nincluded in Citi\u2019s reserving\nprocess under the CECL\nstandard.\n\nSmall Business\nAdministration\u2019s Paycheck\nProtection Program\n\nThe Paycheck Protection\nProgram (the Program)\nauthorizes the origination of\nforgivable loans to small\nbusinesses to pay their\nemployees during the pandemic.\nLoan terms are the same for\nall businesses. Among other\nprograms, Citi is\nparticipating in the Paycheck\nProtection Program and has\nfunded over 30,000 loans\ntotaling $3.8 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, with\napproximately $3.7 outstanding\nat September 30, 2020. Citi\nremains committed to\nsupporting small businesses.\nThe processing of loan\nforgiveness requests under the\nProgram began during the third\nquarter of 2020 and the timing\nfor processing will determine\nwhether there is significant\nforgiveness in the fourth\nquarter of 2020.\n                               10                               \n                                                                \n  RISK FACTORS                                                  \n                                                                \nMacroeconomic and Other\nChallenges and Uncertainties\nRelated to the COVID-19\nPandemic Will Likely Continue\nto Have Negative Impacts on\nCiti\u2019s Businesses and Results\nof Operations and Financial\nCondition.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has\nbecome global, affecting all\nof the countries and\njurisdictions where Citi\noperates. The pandemic and\nresponses to it have had, and\nwill likely continue to have,\na severe impact on global\neconomic conditions, although\nthe impacts will likely vary\nfrom time to time by region,\ncountry or state, largely\ndepending on the duration and\nseverity of the public health\nconsequences, including\navailability of any effective\ntherapeutic or vaccine and\npublic response. These impacts\nto global economic conditions\ninclude, among others:\n\n\u2022 sharply reduced U.S. and\nglobal economic output,\nresulting in significant\nlosses of employment and lower\nconsumer spending, cards\npurchase sales and loan\nvolumes;\n\n\u2022 lower interest rates;\n\n\u2022 disruption of global supply\nchains;\n\n\u2022 significant disruption and\nvolatility in financial\nmarkets;\n\n\u2022 closures, reduced activity\nand failures of many\nbusinesses, leading to loss of\nrevenues and net losses; and\n\n\u2022 the institution of social\ndistancing and restrictions on\nmovement in and among the\nUnited States and other\ncountries.\n\nThe pandemic has had, and will\nlikely continue to have,\nnegative impacts on Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, revenues,\nexpenses, credit costs and\noverall results of operations\nand financial condition, which\ncould be material. The extent\nof the impact on Citi\u2019s\nfinancial performance and\noperations, including its\nability to execute its\nbusiness initiatives and\nstrategies, will continue to\ndepend on future developments\nin the U.S. and globally,\nwhich are uncertain and cannot\nbe predicted, including the\nduration and further spread of\nthe disease, as well as the\nseverity of the economic\ndownturn or any delay or\nweakness in the economic\nrecovery. The impact will in\npart be dependent on\ngovernment and other actions\ntaken to lessen the health and\neconomic repercussions, such\nas additional fiscal stimulus\nand/or monetary policy\nactions, medical investments\nand advances, restrictions on\nmovement of people,\ntransportation and businesses,\nand the effectiveness of past\nand any future fiscal,\nmonetary and other\ngovernmental actions.\n\nOngoing legislative and\nregulatory changes in the U.S.\nand globally to address the\neconomic impact from the\npandemic, such as consumer and\ncorporate relief measures and\ncontinued lower interest\nrates, could further affect\nCiti\u2019s businesses, credit\ncosts and results. Citi could\nalso face challenges,\nincluding legal and\nreputational, and scrutiny in\nits implementation of and\nongoing efforts to provide\nthese relief measures. Such\nimplementations and efforts\nhave resulted in, and may\ncontinue to result in,\nlitigation, including class\nactions, and regulatory and\ngovernment actions and\nproceedings. Such actions may\nresult in judgments,\nsettlements, penalties and\nfines adverse to Citi. In\naddition, the\n\ndifferent types of government\nactions could vary in scale\nand duration across\njurisdictions and regions with\nvarying degrees of\neffectiveness.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\nborrowers will also vary by\nregion, sector or industry,\nwith some borrowers\nexperiencing greater stress\nlevels, which could lead to\nincreased pressure on their\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition, increased\nborrowings or credit ratings\ndowngrades, thus likely\nleading to higher credit costs\nfor Citi. In addition, stress\nlevels ultimately experienced\nby Citi\u2019s borrowers may be\ndifferent from and more\nintense than assumptions made\nin earlier estimates or models\nused by Citi, resulting in a\nfurther increase in Citi\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses or\nnet credit losses.\n\nThe pandemic may not be\ncontained for an extended\nperiod of time, due to a\nfurther emergence or\nreemergence of widespread\ninfections. A prolonged health\ncrisis could continue to\nreduce economic activity in\nthe U.S. and other countries,\nresulting in additional\ndeclines in employment and\nbusiness and consumer\nconfidence and a prolonged\nperiod of lower interest\nrates. These factors could\nfurther negatively impact\nglobal economic activity and\nmarkets and Citi\u2019s consumer\ncustomers and corporate\nclients; cause a continued\ndecline in Citi\u2019s revenues and\nthe demand for its products\nand services; and further\nincrease Citi\u2019s credit and\nother costs. These factors\ncould also cause a continued\nincrease in Citi\u2019s balance\nsheet, risk-weighted assets\nand allowance for credit loss\nreserves, resulting in a\ndecline in regulatory capital\nratios or liquidity measures,\nas well as regulatory demands\nfor higher capital levels\nand/or limitations or\nreductions in capital\ndistributions (such as common\nshare repurchases and\ndividends). Moreover, any\ndisruption or failure of\nCiti\u2019s performance of, or its\nability to perform, key\nbusiness functions, as a\nresult of the continued spread\nof COVID-19 or otherwise,\ncould adversely affect Citi\u2019s\noperations.\n\nAny disruption to, breaches of\nor attacks on Citi\u2019s\ninformation technology\nsystems, including from cyber\nincidents, could have adverse\neffects on Citi\u2019s businesses.\nThese systems are supporting a\nsubstantial portion of Citi\u2019s\nemployees who have been\naffected by local pandemic\nrestrictions and have been\nforced to work remotely. In\naddition, these systems\ninterface with and depend on\nthird-party systems, and Citi\ncould experience service\ndenials or disruptions if\ndemand for such systems were\nto exceed capacity or if a\nthird-party system fails or\nexperiences any interruptions.\nCiti has also taken measures\nto maintain the health and\nsafety of its employees;\nhowever, these measures could\nresult in increased expenses,\nand widespread illness could\nnegatively affect staffing\nwithin certain functions,\nbusinesses or geographies. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s ability to\nrecruit, hire and onboard\nemployees in key areas could\nbe negatively impacted by\nglobal pandemic restrictions.\n\nFurther, it is unclear how the\nmacroeconomic business\nenvironment or societal norms\nmay be impacted after the\npandemic. The post-pandemic\nenvironment may undergo\nunexpected developments or\nchanges in financial markets,\nthe fiscal, monetary, tax and\nregulatory environments and\nconsumer customer and\ncorporate client behavior.\nThese developments and changes\ncould have an adverse impact\non Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. Ongoing\n                               11                               \nbusiness and regulatory\nuncertainties and changes may\nmake Citi\u2019s longer term\nbusiness, balance sheet and\nbudget planning more difficult\nor costly. Citi, its\nmanagement and its businesses\nmay also experience increased\nor different competitive and\nother challenges in this\nenvironment.

This reflects the U.S. Basel III requirement to\nreport the lower of risk-based capital ratios under both the\nStandardized Approach and Advanced Approaches in accordance with\nthe Collins Amendment of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n(5) Dividend payout ratio is calculated as dividends declared\nper common share as a percentage of net income per diluted\nshare.\n\n(6) Total payout ratio is calculated as total common dividends\ndeclared plus common stock repurchases as a percentage of net\nincome available to common shareholders ( Net income , less\npreferred dividends).

Average\ndeposits increased 13% and\naverage loans increased 4%.\nAssets under management\nincreased 1% and investment\nsales increased 43%. Retail\nlending revenues increased 3%,\nreflecting growth in\nmortgages.\n\nCards revenues decreased 23%,\nprimarily driven by lower\npurchase sales (down 17%) and\nlower average loans (down\n11%), reflecting the impact of\nthe pandemic on customer\nactivity, including from lower\ntravel spend in the region,\ngiven Citi\u2019s skew to an\naffluent client base and a\ngreater proportion of fee\nrevenues coming from travel-\nrelated interchange and\nforeign transaction fees.\n\nExpenses decreased 2%, as\nlower marketing and other\ndiscretionary expenses, lower\nvolume-related costs, as well\nas efficiency savings, were\npartially offset by ongoing\ninvestment spending.\n\nProvisions of $233 million\nincreased 29%, driven by a\nhigher allowance for credit\nlosses (ACL) build as well as\nhigher net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses increased 6%, as\npandemic lockdowns and the\ndeterioration in the macro-\nenvironment impacted credit\nperformance. The ACL build in\nthe third quarter was $41\nmillion, reflecting an\nincrease in the qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent of the reserve to\nreflect the potential for a\nhigher level of stress and/or\nsomewhat slower economic\nrecovery (compared to a build\nof $2 million in the prior-\nyear period under prior\naccounting standards). The\nincrease was partially offset\nby the impact of a change in\nestimate effected by a change\nin accounting principle for\nthird-party collection costs,\nas well as lower card loan\nvolumes (see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below).\n\nFor additional information on\nAsia GCB \u2019s retail banking\nportfolios and its Citi-\nbranded cards portfolios, see\n\u201cCredit Risk\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d\nbelow.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below,\nand Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to the\npandemic, see \u201cCOVID-19\nPandemic Overview\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  2020 YTD vs. 2019 YTD                                         \n                                                                \nYear-to-date, Asia GCB\nexperienced similar trends to\nthose described above. Net\nincome decreased 63%, driven\nby lower revenues and higher\ncost of credit, partially\noffset by lower expenses.\n\nRevenues decreased 10%, driven\nby a decline in both retail\nbanking and cards revenues.\nRetail banking revenues\ndecreased 3%, as growth in\ndeposits and higher fees on\ninvestments and foreign\ncurrency transactions due to\nhigher volumes and volatility\nwere more than offset by lower\ndeposit spreads, insurance\nrevenues and the one-time gain\nin the prior-year period.\nRetail lending revenues\nincreased 5%, reflecting\ngrowth in mortgages. Cards\nrevenues decreased 20%, driven\nby the same factors described\nabove, as well as a small one-\ntime gain in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nExpenses decreased 3%, driven\nby the same factors described\nabove.\n\nProvisions of $1.1 billion\nincreased $576 million from\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby a higher ACL build and\nhigher net credit losses. NCLs\nincreased 11%, driven by the\nsame factors described above.\nThe ACL build was $502\nmillion, primarily reflecting\nthe impact of deterioration in\nCiti\u2019s macroeconomic outlook\nin each of the first and\nsecond quarters of 2020,\nprimarily driven by the\npandemic, on estimated\nlifetime credit losses under\nCECL (compared to a release of\n$10 million in the prior-year\nperiod under prior accounting\nstandards).

includes\nboth accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on\nloan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives\nand the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at\nfair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted\nagainst the private bank and corporate lending revenues to\nreflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on loan\nhedges include $(116) million and $224 million related to the\ncorporate loan portfolio and $(8) million and $37 million\nrelated to the private bank for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020, respectively. All of gains (losses) on loan\nhedges are related to corporate loan portfolio for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.

Excluding the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges, Banking revenues were\ndown 2%, driven by lower\nrevenues in treasury and trade\nsolutions and corporate\nlending, partially offset by\nhigher revenues in investment\nbanking and the private bank.\nMarkets and securities\nservices revenues were up 16%,\nreflecting higher revenues in\nboth fixed income and equity\nmarkets, driven by increased\nclient activity, partially\noffset by lower revenues in\nsecurities services.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nwere up 13%, reflecting growth\nin overall market wallet as\nwell as gains in wallet share.\nAdvisory revenues decreased\n41%, largely reflecting a\ndecline in the market wallet.\nEquity underwriting revenues\nincreased 96%, reflecting\ngrowth in North America , EMEA\nand Asia , driven by continued\nstrength in the market wallet\nas well as wallet share gains.\nDebt underwriting revenues\nincreased 5%, reflecting\nparticular strength in North\nAmerica and Asia , partially\noffset by EMEA. The increase\nin revenues was largely driven\nby a higher market wallet in\ninvestment grade debt\nunderwriting.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 6%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, revenues\ndecreased 4%, driven by\ndeclines in EMEA and Asia ,\npartially offset by growth in\nNorth America . The decline in\nrevenues was driven by both\nthe cash and trade businesses.\nThe decline in revenues in the\ncash business reflected the\ncontinued impact of lower\ninterest rates and a slowdown\nin commercial cards spend\ndriven by the impact of the\npandemic, partially offset by\nstrong deposit volumes.\nAverage deposit balances\nincreased 25% (26% excluding\nthe impact of FX translation),\nreflecting strong client\nengagement and solid growth\nacross all regions. In trade,\nrevenues were impacted by a\ndecline in trade fees and\ntrade loans, reflecting a\nslowdown in underlying trade\nrelated to the pandemic,\npartially offset by improved\ntrade spreads.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\ndecreased 38%, including\nhigher losses on loan hedges,\nas credit spreads tightened\nduring the quarter. Excluding\nthe impact of losses on loan\nhedges, revenues decreased\n25%, as higher volumes were\nmore than offset by lower\nspreads. Average loans were up\n3% from the prior-year period,\nreflecting elevated volumes as\nthe business continued to\nassist clients with sourcing\nliquidity in the evolving\nenvironment. Average loans\ndeclined 13% from the prior\nquarter, largely reflecting\nrepayments.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 7%. Excluding the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges, revenues increased 8%,\nreflecting particular strength\nin Asia and EMEA . The\nincrease was driven by\ncontinued strong client\nactivity, particularly in\ncapital markets as well as\nhigher managed investments\nrevenues and higher loan and\ndeposit volumes, partially\noffset by lower deposit\nspreads due to the low\ninterest rate environment.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 18%,\nreflecting strength in North\nAmerica and EMEA , largely\ndriven by strong client\nactivity in spread products\nand commodities. Non-interest\nrevenues increased, reflecting\nhigher corporate and investor\nactivity, as volumes remained\nelevated particularly in\nspreads products and\ncommodities. Net interest\nrevenues also increased,\nlargely reflecting a change in\nthe mix of trading positions.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\nwere largely unchanged. Spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome revenues increased 76%,\nreflecting strong client\nactivity following robust\nprimary issuance, particularly\nin flow trading and financing\nproducts, as well as a more\nfavorable market making\nenvironment, as evidenced by\nspread tightening. Commodities\nrevenues increased, reflecting\na more favorable market making\nenvironment, as volatility\nremained elevated,\nparticularly in gold and oil.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 15%, driven by\nhigher revenues in cash\nequities and derivatives,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in prime finance.\nEquity derivatives revenues\nincreased, reflecting strong\nclient activity and continued\nmarket volatility,\nparticularly in North America\n.

Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues decreased 4%, driven\nby EMEA and Latin America , as\nhigher deposit volumes were\nmore than offset by lower\ndeposit spreads due to the low\ninterest rate environment.\n\nFor additional information on\ntrends in ICG \u2019s deposit and\ntrade loans, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Liquidity\nRisk\u2014Loans\u201d and \u201c\u2014Deposits\u201d\nbelow.\n\nExpenses were up 3%,\nreflecting continued\ninvestments in infrastructure,\nrisk management and controls,\nhigher compensations costs and\nvolume-driven growth,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nProvisions increased to $838\nmillion, primarily reflecting\na higher ACL build as well as\nhigher net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses were $326\nmillion, compared to $110\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by\nwrite-offs across various\nsectors in both North America\nand EMEA , primarily\nreflecting smaller-sized\nenergy and energy-related\nexposures. The net credit\nlosses were largely offset by\nthe release of previously\nestablished ACL reserves.\n\nThe ACL build was $529\nmillion, compared to $43\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod under prior accounting\nstandards. The higher build\nwas primarily driven by an\nincrease in the qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent of the reserve to\nreflect the potential for a\nhigher level of stress and/or\nsomewhat slower economic\nrecovery.\n\nThe ACL build consisted of a\n$106 million build for funded\nloans and a $423 million\nprovision on unfunded lending\ncommitments. This relative\ndifference in the builds in\npart reflected the release of\ncertain reserves held against\nfunded loans and builds\nagainst the unfunded lending\ncommitments when the funded\nloans (particularly under\nrevolving line of credit\nfacilities) were repaid during\nthe quarter. The provision for\nunfunded lending commitments\nalso was driven by downgrades,\nand the increase in the\nqualitative management\nadjustment noted above.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020,\nreserves held on Citi\u2019s\nbalance sheet represented 1.8%\nof funded loans, compared to\n1.7% as of June 30, 2020,\nincluding 5.7% of reserves\nheld against the non-\ninvestment grade portion,\ncompared to 4.9% as of June\n30, 2020.\n\nFor additional information on\nICG \u2019s corporate credit\nportfolio, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u2014Corporate Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below,\nand Notes 1, 13 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to the\npandemic, see \u201cCOVID-19\nPandemic Overview\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  2020 YTD vs. 2019 YTD                                         \n                                                                \nNet income decreased 16%, as\nsignificantly higher cost of\ncredit and higher expenses\nwere partially offset by\nhigher revenues.\n\nRevenues were up 17%, driven\nby a 34% increase in Markets\nand securities services\nrevenues as well as a 2%\nincrease in Banking revenues\n(including the impact of gains\n(losses) on loan hedges).\nExcluding the impact of gains\n(losses) on loan hedges,\nBanking revenues declined 2%,\nas growth in investment\nbanking and the private bank\nwas more than offset by a\ndecrease in treasury and trade\nsolutions and corporate\nlending. Excluding the pretax\ngain of approximately $350\nmillion on Citi\u2019s investment\nin Tradeweb in the prior-year\nperiod, Markets and securities\nservices revenues increased\n37%, primarily driven by\ngrowth in both fixed income\nmarkets and equity markets,\npartially offset by a decline\nin securities services.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nincreased 16%. Advisory\nrevenues decreased 12%,\nreflecting a decline in the\noverall market wallet, despite\ngains in share. Equity\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased 58%, primarily\nreflecting growth in the\nmarket wallet and gains in\nshare. Debt underwriting\nrevenues increased 14%,\nreflecting growth in the\nmarket wallet as well as gains\nin share.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 7%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, revenues\ndecreased 5%, reflecting lower\nrevenues in both cash and\ntrade, driven by the same\nfactors described above.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nwere largely unchanged,\nincluding gains on loan hedges\nin the current period compared\nto losses in the prior-year\nperiod. Excluding the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges, revenues decreased\n25%, primarily driven by lower\nloan spreads and an adjustment\nto the residual value of a\nlease financing asset,\npartially offset by higher\nloan volumes.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 10%. Excluding the\nimpact of gains on loan hedges\nin the current period,\nrevenues increased 9%,\nreflecting strength across all\nregions, driven by the same\nfactors described above.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 42%.\nExcluding the Tradeweb gain in\nthe prior-year period,\nrevenues increased 47%,\nreflecting higher revenues\nacross all regions, with\nstrong performance across\nrates and currencies, spread\nproducts, and commodities due\nto the impact of market\nconditions, including elevated\nvolatility, related to\npandemic. Non-interest\nrevenues increased, reflecting\nhigher corporate and investor\nclient activity, as\nvolatility, volumes and\nspreads remained elevated. Net\ninterest revenues also\nincreased, reflecting lower\nfunding costs as well as a\nchange in the mix of trading\npositions in support of client\nactivity.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 18%, driven largely\nby higher revenues in both\ncash equities and equity\nderivatives, partially offset\nby lower revenues in prime\nfinance.\n                               29                               \n\u2022 Securities services revenues\ndeclined 4% (down 2% excluding\nthe impact of foreign\nexchange) driven by the same\nfactors described above.\n\nExpenses were up 4%, driven by\nthe same factors described\nabove.\n\nProvisions increased to $6.7\nbillion, driven by net credit\nlosses of $777 million,\ncompared to $279 million in\nthe prior-year period, and an\nACL build of $5.9 billion\ncompared to a modest build in\nthe prior-year period. The\nincrease in net credit losses\nwas driven by the same factors\ndescribed above.\n\nThe increase in the ACL build\nprimarily reflected the impact\nof a deterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook under\nthe CECL standard, driven by\nthe impact of the pandemic\nacross multiple sectors, as\nwell as downgrades in the\nportfolio over the course of\nthe year. Sectors\nsignificantly impacted by the\npandemic (including energy and\nenergy-related, aviation,\nconsumer retail, commercial\nreal estate and autos) drove\napproximately half of the ACL\nreserve build year-to-date.\nThe ACL build also included an\nincrease in the qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent of the reserve to\nreflect the potential for a\nhigher level of stress and/or\nsomewhat slower economic\nrecovery.\n                               30                               \n                                                                \n  CORPORATE/OTHER                                               \n                                                                \nCorporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global\nstaff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal\nand compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global\noperations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as\nCorporate Treasury, certain North America legacy consumer loan\nportfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for\nadditional information on Corporate/Other , see \u201cCitigroup\nSegments\u201d above).

The final rules ease\ncapital distribution\nlimitations in an effort to\nreduce the impact of using\nregulatory capital buffers,\nmodify the regulatory capital\ntransition provision related\nto the Current Expected Credit\nLosses (CECL) methodology, and\nneutralize the regulatory\ncapital impact of the Money\nMarket Mutual Fund Liquidity\nFacility and the Paycheck\nProtection Program.

apply\nthe modified transition\nprovision related to the\nimpact of the CECL accounting\nstandard on regulatory\ncapital, as provided by the\nU.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule.\nUnder the modified CECL\ntransition provision, the\nchanges in retained earnings\n(after-tax), deferred tax\nassets (DTAs) arising from\ntemporary differences, and the\nallowance for credit losses\nupon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date have been\ndeferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per\nyear commencing January 1,\n2022. For the ongoing impact\nof CECL, Citigroup is allowed\nto adjust retained earnings\nand the allowance for credit\nlosses in an amount equal to\n25% of the change in the\nallowance for credit losses\nrecognized through earnings\n(pre-tax) for each period\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The\ncumulative adjustments to\nretained earnings and the\nallowance for credit losses\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital\nat 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related\nto the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding\nadjustments to average on-\nbalance sheet assets are\nreflected in quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nand Total Leverage Exposure.\nAdditionally, the increase in\nDTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences upon the January\n1, 2020 adoption date has been\ndeducted from risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and will phase in\nto RWA at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022.\n\n(3) Commencing with the\nquarter ended June 30, 2020,\nloans originated under the\nPaycheck Protection Program\nreceive a 0% risk weight under\nthe Advanced Approaches and\nStandardized Approach.\n\n(4) Citi\u2019s reportable Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital and Tier\n1 Capital ratios were derived\nunder the Basel III Advanced\nApproaches framework as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 and June\n30, 2020, and the Basel III\nStandardized Approach as of\nDecember 31, 2019, whereas\nCiti\u2019s reportable Total\nCapital ratio was the lower\nderived under the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches framework\nfor all periods presented.\n\n(5) Commencing with the second\nquarter of 2020, exposures\npledged as collateral pursuant\nto a non-recourse loan that is\nprovided as part of the\nPaycheck Protection Program\nLiquidity Facility are\nexcluded from quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nand Total Leverage Exposure.\n\n(6) Tier 1 Leverage ratio\ndenominator. Represents\nquarterly average total assets\nless amounts deducted from\nTier 1 Capital.\n\n(7) Supplementary Leverage\nratio denominator. Commencing\nwith the second quarter of\n2020, Citigroup\u2019s Total\nLeverage Exposure temporarily\nexcludes U.S. Treasuries and\ndeposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks.

accordance with Federal Reserve Board\nregulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under\nU.S. GAAP.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision\nrelated to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on\nregulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the\nallowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the\nongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained\nearnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal\nto 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses\nrecognized through earnings (pre-tax) for each period between\nJanuary 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative\nadjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit\nlosses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.\n\n(3) Includes goodwill \u201cembedded\u201d in the valuation of significant\ncommon stock investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions.\n           Footnotes continue on the following page.            \n                                                                \n                               35                               \n(4) Of Citi\u2019s $24.8 billion of net DTAs at September 30, 2020,\n$15.2 billion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\npursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.6 billion was\nexcluded. Excluded from Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as\nof September 30, 2020 was $12.1 billion of net DTAs arising from\nnet operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business\ncredit carry-forwards, which was reduced by $2.5 billion of net\nDTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other\nintangible assets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules,\ngoodwill and these other intangible assets are deducted net of\nassociated DTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.\nDTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and\ngeneral business credit carry-forwards are required to be\nentirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the\nU.S. Basel III rules. Citi\u2019s DTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences are less than the 10% limitation under the U.S.\nBasel III rules and therefore not subject to deduction from\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting\nat 250%.\n\n(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the\nVolcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting\ncertain proprietary investment activities and limits their\nownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. The U.S.\nagencies issued a revised Volcker Rule 2.0 in November 2019 that\nremoves permitted investments in third-party covered funds from\ncapital deduction requirements, among other changes. Upon the\nremoval of the capital deduction, permitted investments in\nthird-party covered funds will be included in risk-weighted\nassets. Mandatory compliance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0\nis required by January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted,\nin whole or in part, beginning January 1, 2020. Additionally,\nthe U.S. agencies issued a revised Volcker Rule 2.1 in July 2020\nthat improves and streamlines several \u201ccovered funds\u201d\nrequirements, with an effective date of October 1, 2020. Citi\ncontinues to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership\ninterests in covered funds for all periods presented.\n\n(7) 50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of\ninsurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each\nof Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.\n\n(8) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the\nU.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased-out of Tier 2\nCapital by January 1, 2022.\n\n(9) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach, in which the\nallowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any\nexcess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at\ncredit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of allowance for\ncredit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital, subject to limitation, under the Standardized Approach\nframework was $13.6 billion and $13.9 billion at September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n                               36                               \n

provided by the\nU.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule.\nUnder the modified CECL\ntransition provision, the\nchanges in DTAs arising from\ntemporary differences and the\nallowance for credit losses\nupon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date have been\ndeferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per\nyear commencing January 1,\n2022. For the ongoing impact\nof CECL, Citigroup is allowed\nto adjust the allowance for\ncredit losses in an amount\nequal to 25% of the change in\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses recognized through\nearnings (pre-tax) for each\nperiod between January 1, 2020\nand December 31, 2021. The\ncumulative adjustments to the\nallowance for credit losses\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital\nat 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related\nto the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding\nadjustments to average on-\nbalance sheet assets are\nreflected in Total Leverage\nExposure.\n\n(3) Commencing with the second\nquarter of 2020, Citigroup\u2019s\nTotal Leverage Exposure\ntemporarily excludes U.S.\nTreasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks.

The ratio\nincreased from the second\nquarter of 2020 primarily due\nto net income of $3.2 billion\nand a decrease in Total\nLeverage Exposure, partially\noffset by the return of $1.1\nbillion of capital to common\nshareholders. The ratio\nincreased from the fourth\nquarter of 2019, primarily\ndriven by a decrease in Total\nLeverage Exposure mainly\nattributable to the 103 basis\npoint benefit resulting from\nthe Federal

capital requirements\ninclude the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of which must\nbe composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital).\n\n(2) Citibank has elected to apply the modified transition\nprovision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard\non regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax),\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences,\nand the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020\nCECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\nFor the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank is allowed to adjust\nretained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an\namount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit\nlosses recognized through earnings (pre-tax) for each period\nbetween January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative\nadjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit\nlosses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding adjustments to\naverage on-balance sheet assets are reflected in quarterly\nadjusted average total assets and Total Leverage Exposure.\nAdditionally, the increase in DTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has been\ndeducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in to\nRWA at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\n\n(3) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach in which the\nallowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any\nexcess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at\ncredit risk-weighted assets.\n\n(4) Commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2020, loans\noriginated under the Paycheck Protection Program receive a 0%\nrisk weight under the Advanced Approaches and Standardized\nApproach.\n\n(5) Citibank\u2019s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of September 30,\n2020 and June 30, 2020, and the Basel III Standardized Approach\nas of December 31, 2019, whereas Citibank\u2019s reportable Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower\nderived under the Basel III Standardized Approach framework for\nall periods presented.\n\n(6) Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of\n6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nregulations applicable to insured depository institutions as\nestablished by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also\nmaintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d For additional information, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Current Regulatory Capital Standards\u2014Prompt\nCorrective Action Framework\u201d in Citigroup\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\n(7) Commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2020, exposures\npledged as collateral pursuant to a non-recourse loan that is\nprovided as part of the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity\nFacility are excluded from quarterly adjusted average total\nassets and Total Leverage Exposure.\n\n(8) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly\naverage total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n\n(9) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

In addition,\nCitibank was also \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d as of September\n30, 2020.\n\nImpact of Changes on Citigroup\nand Citibank Capital Ratios\n\nThe following tables present\nthe estimated sensitivity of\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncapital ratios to changes of\n$100 million in Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital\nand Total Capital (numerator),\nand changes of $1 billion in\n\nAdvanced Approaches and\nStandardized Approach risk-\nweighted assets and quarterly\nadjusted average total assets,\nas well as Total Leverage\nExposure (denominator), as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.

For\nCitigroup, the SCB rule\nreplaces the fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, and equals the peak-\nto-trough Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio decline under\nthe Supervisory Severely\nAdverse scenario used in the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST), plus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, subject to a floor\nof 2.5%. The fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nwill continue to apply under\nthe Advanced Approaches\nframework.\n\nSCB-based minimum capital\nrequirements will be updated\nat least once per year as part\nof the CCAR process. Similar\nto the current Capital\nConservation Buffer, a breach\nof the SCB will result in\ngraduated limitations on\ncapital distributions. For\nadditional information\nregarding the SCB final rule,\nsee \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nStandards Developments\u2014Stress\nCapital Buffer\u201d in Citi\u2019s\nFirst Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.\nFor additional information\nregarding CCAR and DFAST, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Current\nRegulatory Capital\nStandards\u2014Stress Testing\nComponent of Capital Planning\u201d\nin Citi\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\nThe SCB applies to Citigroup\nonly. The regulatory capital\nframework applicable to\nCitibank, including the\nCapital Conservation Buffer,\nis unchanged by Citigroup\u2019s\nSCB.\n\nCapital Plan Resubmission and\nRelated Limitations on Capital\nDistributions\n\nIn June 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board determined that\nchanges in financial markets\nand macroeconomic outlooks\nrelated to the COVID-19\npandemic could have a material\neffect on the risk profile and\nfinancial condition of each\nfirm subject to its capital\nplan rule and, therefore,\nrequire updated capital plans.\nCitigroup resubmitted its\ncapital plan on November 2,\n2020.\n\nIn September 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board announced that\nit was extending for an\nadditional quarter several\nmeasures that were previously\nannounced for the third\nquarter of 2020 to ensure that\nlarge banks maintain a high\nlevel of capital resilience.\nThrough the end of the fourth\nquarter of 2020, share\nrepurchases continue to be\nprohibited and dividends\ncontinue to be capped and tied\nto a formula based on recent\nincome. These limitations on\ncapital distributions may be\nextended by the Federal\nReserve Board. For additional\ninformation on the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s limitations on\ncapital distributions, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Capital\nPlan Resubmission and Related\nLimitations on Capital\nDistributions\u201d in Citi\u2019s\nSecond Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.\n\nOn June 29, 2020, Citi\nannounced that its planned\ncapital actions include common\ndividends. Citi declared\ncommon dividends of $0.51 per\nshare for the fourth quarter\nof 2020 on October 22, 2020,\nconsistent with the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s income-based\nformula for temporary\nlimitations on common\ndividends announced in\nSeptember 2020.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board may,\nbut is not required to,\nrecalculate each firm\u2019s SCB as\na result of the capital plan\nresubmission. The Federal\nReserve Board has stated that\nit will release results of the\nsecond round of stress tests\nby December 31, 2020.\n                               44                               \n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Standards Developments                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  TLAC Holdings                                                 \n                                                                \nIn October 2020, the U.S.\nbanking agencies released a\nfinal rule that creates a new\nregulatory capital deduction\napplicable to Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations for certain\ninvestments in covered debt\ninstruments issued by GSIBs.\nThe final rule is\nsubstantially consistent with\nan April 2019 proposal, and is\nintended to reduce\ninterconnectedness and\nsystemic risk by creating an\nincentive for Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations to limit their\nexposure to GSIBs.\n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, non-significant\ninvestments in the capital of\nunconsolidated financial\ninstitutions are subject to\ndeduction from regulatory\ncapital using the\ncorresponding deduction\napproach if, in the aggregate,\nthey exceed 10% of the banking\norganization\u2019s Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital. Non-\nsignificant investments in the\ncapital of unconsolidated\nfinancial institutions that\nare not deducted from\nregulatory capital are risk\nweighted in the usual manner.\n\nUnder the final rule, an\ninvestment in a \u201ccovered debt\ninstrument\u201d will be treated as\nan investment in a Tier 2\nCapital instrument and,\ntherefore, will be subject to\ndeduction from the Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganization\u2019s own Tier 2\nCapital in accordance with the\nexisting rules for non-\nsignificant investments in\nunconsolidated financial\ninstitutions. Covered debt\ninstruments include unsecured\ndebt instruments that are\n\u201celigible debt securities\u201d for\npurposes of the TLAC rule, or\nthat are pari passu or\nsubordinated to such\nsecurities, in addition to\ncertain unsecured debt\ninstruments issued by foreign\nGSIBs.\n\nTo support a deep and liquid\nmarket for covered debt\ninstruments, the rule provides\nan exception from the approach\ndescribed above for covered\ndebt instruments held for\nmarket-making activities for\n30 days or less (or longer,\nfor synthetic exposures only),\nif the aggregate amount of\nsuch debt instruments does not\nexceed 5% of the banking\norganization\u2019s Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital.\n\nAdditionally, the final rule\nrequires banking organizations\nto deduct from Tier 2 Capital\ninvestments in their own\ncovered debt instruments.\n\nThe final rule will become\neffective for Citigroup and\nCitibank on April 1, 2021.\nCiti estimates that the final\nrule will not materially\nimpact Citigroup or Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital upon\nadoption.\n                               45                               \nTangible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Returns on\nEquity\n\nTangible common equity (TCE),\nas defined by Citi, represents\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity\nless goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nMSRs).

third\nquarter of 2020, similar to\nthe prior quarter. Net credit\nloss rates were positively\nimpacted by the relief\nprograms Citi implemented\nsince the beginning of the\npandemic, combined with the\nbenefit of reduced customer\nspending and significant\ngovernment stimulus and\nassistance, as well as other\nbanks\u2019 consumer relief\nprograms. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rates broadly\ndeclined sequentially for the\nsame reasons. In addition, as\ndiscussed above, loans\nmodified under Citi\u2019s consumer\nrelief programs continue to be\nreported in the same\ndelinquency bucket they were\nin at the time of\nmodification, and thus would\nnot be reported as 90+ days\npast due or written off for\nthe duration of the programs\n(which have various durations,\nand certain of which may be\nrenewed by the customer). Citi\ncontinues to expect that 90+\ndays past due delinquency and\nnet credit loss rates in North\nAmerica GCB , Latin America\nGCB and Asia GCB will be\nadversely impacted by the\nevolving macroeconomic and\nmarket conditions. These\ninclude the severity and\nduration of the impact from\nthe pandemic, as these\ngovernment stimulus and\nconsumer relief programs\nexpire and when the loans are\nno longer reported in the same\ndelinquency bucket as they\nwere when the relief programs\nbegan. For additional\ninformation about trends,\nuncertainties and risks\nrelated to the pandemic, see\n\u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Overview\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u201d above. The\nfollowing charts show the\nquarterly trends in\ndelinquency rates (90+ days\npast due (90+ DPD) rate) and\nthe net credit loss (NCL)\nrates across both retail\nbanking and cards for total\nGCB and by region.\n                           \n  Global Consumer Banking  \n                           \n                     \n  North America GCB  \n                     \nNorth America GCB provides\nmortgage, home equity, small\nbusiness and personal loans\nthrough Citi\u2019s retail banking\nnetwork and card products\nthrough Citi-branded cards and\nCiti retail services\nbusinesses. The retail bank is\nconcentrated in six major\nmetropolitan cities in the\nUnited States (for additional\ninformation on the U.S. retail\nbank, see \u201c North America GCB\n\u201d above). As of September 30,\n2020, approximately 70% of\nNorth America GCB consumer\nloans consisted of Citi-\nbranded and Citi retail\nservices cards, which\ngenerally drives the overall\ncredit performance of North\nAmerica GCB (for additional\ninformation on North America\nGCB \u2019s cards portfolios,\nincluding delinquency and net\ncredit loss rates, see \u201cCredit\nCard Trends\u201d below). As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss and 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rates in North\nAmerica GCB decreased quarter-\nover-quarter, driven by the\nimpact of the relief programs\ndescribed above, unemployment\nbenefits and government\nstimulus. Year-over-year, the\nnet credit loss and 90+ days\npast due delinquency rates\ndecreased, also driven by the\nimpact of the relief programs,\nunemployment benefits and\ngovernment stimulus.\n                     \n  Latin America GCB  \n                     \nLatin America GCB operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex,\none of Mexico\u2019s largest banks,\nand provides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nLatin America GCB serves a\nmore mass-market segment in\nMexico and focuses on\ndeveloping multi-product\nrelationships with customers.\n                               49                               \nThe pandemic adversely\naffected the economy in\nMexico, and customers did not\nbenefit from a similar level\nof government stimulus as\nother regions. As shown in the\nchart above, the 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate in Latin\nAmerica GCB decreased quarter-\nover-quarter, as customers\ncontinued to participate in\nCiti\u2019s relief programs, while\nthe net credit loss rate\nincreased, driven by losses\nrelated to customers\nineligible for the relief\nprograms. Year-over-year, the\nnet credit loss rate and 90+\ndays past due delinquency rate\nincreased, primarily due to\nthe pandemic impact described\nabove and lower loan balances.\n              \n  Asia(1)GCB  \n              \n(1) Asia includes GCB\nactivities in certain EMEA\ncountries for all periods\npresented.

As shown in the chart\nabove, quarter-over-quarter,\nthe net credit loss rate in\nAsia GCB decreased, driven by\nan increase in average loans,\nmainly in the retail\nportfolios. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate modestly\nincreased, primarily driven by\nthe cards portfolio. Year-\nover-year, the net credit loss\nrate and the 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate increased due\nto the pandemic-related\nmacroeconomic impact. The\nperformance of Asia GCB \u2019s\nportfolios reflects the strong\ncredit profiles in the\nregion\u2019s target customer\nsegments.

Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated\nprobability of default for a counterparty and are derived by\nleveraging validated statistical models, scorecard models and\nexternal agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in\ncombination with consideration of factors specific to the\nobligor or market, such as management experience, competitive\nposition, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility\nrisk ratings are assigned that reflect\n\nthe probability of default of the obligor and factors that\naffect the loss given default of the facility, such as support\nor collateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally\ncorrespond to BBB and above are considered investment grade,\nwhile those below are considered non-investment grade. Citigroup\nalso has incorporated environmental factors like climate risk\nassessment and reporting criteria for certain obligors, as\nnecessary. Factors evaluated include consideration of climate\nrisk to an obligor\u2019s business and physical assets and, when\nrelevant, consideration of cost-effective options to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n                               54                               \nThe following table presents\nthe corporate credit portfolio\n(excluding the delinquency-\nmanaged private bank\nportfolio) by facility risk\nrating as a percentage of the\ntotal corporate credit\nportfolio:\n                                                                \n                     Total                                      \n                  exposure                                      \n                 September                         December     \n                       30,       June 30,               31,     \n                      2020           2020              2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A              48  %          49  %             50  %  \n  BBB                   31             31                33     \n  BB/B                  17             16                15     \n  CCC or                 4              4                 2     \n  below                                                         \n  Total                100  %         100  %            100  %  \n                                                                \nNote: Total exposure includes\ndirect outstandings and\nunfunded lending commitments.\nIn addition to the\ncounterparty and facility risk\nratings assigned to all\nexposures, Citi may classify\nexposures in the corporate\ncredit portfolio. These\nclassifications are consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s interpretation of\nthe U.S. banking regulators\u2019\ndefinition of criticized\nexposures, which may\ncategorize exposures as\nspecial mention, substandard\nor doubtful. Risk ratings and\nclassifications are reviewed\nregularly, and adjusted as\nappropriate. The credit review\nprocess incorporates\nquantitative and qualitative\nfactors, including financial\nand non-financial disclosures\nor metrics, idiosyncratic\nevents or changes to the\ncompetitive, regulatory or\nmacroeconomic environment.\nThis includes but is not\nlimited to exposures in those\nsectors significantly impacted\nby the pandemic (including\nenergy and energy-related,\naviation, consumer retail,\ncommercial real estate and\nautos). Citigroup believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of September 30,\n2020. During the course of the\nthird quarter of 2020, and\nsince the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, Citigroup\nhas taken action to adjust\ninternal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nexposures are downgraded, the\nprobability of default\nincreases. Downgrades of\nexposures tend to result in a\nhigher provision for credit\nlosses. In addition,\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other risk\nmitigants to hedge the\nincremental credit risk, or\nmay result in seeking to\nreduce exposure to an obligor\nor an industry sector.\nCitigroup will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure the\nappropriate probability of\ndefault is incorporated into\nall risk assessments.

As of\nDecember 31, 2019, Citi\u2019s total exposure to these energy-related\nentities remained largely consistent with September 30, 2019, at\napproximately $6 billion, of which approximately $3 billion\nconsisted of direct outstanding funded loans.\n                               58                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Risk Mitigation                                        \n                                                                \nAs part of its overall risk\nmanagement activities,\nCitigroup uses credit\nderivatives and other risk\nmitigants to hedge portions of\nthe credit risk in its\ncorporate credit portfolio, in\naddition to outright asset\nsales. Citi may enter into\npartial-term hedges as well as\nfull-term hedges. In advance\nof the expiration of partial-\nterm hedges, Citi will\ndetermine, among other\nfactors, the economic\nfeasibility of hedging the\nremaining life of the\ninstrument. The results of the\nmark-to-market and any\nrealized gains or losses on\ncredit derivatives are\nreflected primarily in\nPrincipal transactions in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome. At September 30, 2020,\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019, ICG (excluding the\ndelinquency-managed private\nbank portfolio) had economic\nhedges on the corporate credit\nportfolio of $38.4 billion,\n$36.5 billion and $32.1\nbillion, respectively.\nCitigroup\u2019s expected credit\nloss model used in the\ncalculation of its loan loss\nreserve does not include the\nfavorable impact of credit\nderivatives and other\nmitigants that are marked to\nmarket. In addition, the\nreported amounts of direct\noutstandings and unfunded\nlending commitments in the\ntables above do not reflect\nthe impact of these hedging\ntransactions. The credit\nprotection was economically\nhedging underlying ICG\n(excluding the delinquency-\nmanaged private bank\nportfolio) corporate credit\nportfolio exposures with the\nfollowing risk rating\ndistribution: Rating of Hedged\nExposure\n                                                                \n                 September                         December     \n                       30,       June 30,               31,     \n                      2020           2020              2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A              29  %          30  %             36  %  \n  BBB                   52             53                51     \n  BB/B                  16             14                12     \n  CCC or                 3              3                 1     \n  below                                                         \n  Total                100  %         100  %            100  %  \n                                                                \n                               59                               \n                                                                \n  ADDITIONAL CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CREDIT DETAILS              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Loans Outstanding                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  C\u2026                                                            \n  l\u2026                                                            \n  In                                                            \n  N\u2026       3rd        2nd        1st         4th        3rd     \n  A\u2026       Qt\u2026        Qt\u2026        Qt\u2026        Qtr.

Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update\n(ASC) 326, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (CECL) . The ASU\nintroduces a new credit loss methodology requiring earlier\nrecognition of credit losses while also providing additional\ntransparency about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi\nrecorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase\nin the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset\nincrease of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a\n$4.9 billion build to the Consumer allowance for credit losses\ndue to longer estimated tenors than under the incurred loss\nmethodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a\n$(0.8) billion decrease to the Corporate allowance for credit\nlosses due to shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of\nrecoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based\non an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and\ngeographies. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further discussion on the impact of Citi\u2019s adoption of CECL.\n                               61                               \n(2) During the second quarter of 2020, Citi updated its ACLL\nestimate of lifetime credit losses related to a change in\naccounting principle for variable post-charge-off third-party\nagency collection costs in its U.S. cards portfolios. After June\n30, 2020, these costs are recorded as operating expenses for\nfuture periods as they are incurred. The impact of this change\nin estimate effected by a change in accounting principle\nresulted in an approximate $426 million reduction in Citi's\nestimated ACLL at June 30, 2020.\n\n(3) During the third quarter of 2020, Citi updated its ACLL\nestimate of lifetime credit losses related to a change in\naccounting principle for variable post-charge-off third-party\nagency collection costs, primarily in its international cards\nportfolios. After June 30, 2020, these costs are recorded as\noperating expenses for future periods as they are incurred. The\nimpact of this change in estimate effected by a change in\naccounting principle resulted in an approximate $122 million\nreduction in Citi's estimated ACLL at September 30, 2020. For\nadditional information, see \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below.\n\n(4) Recoveries have been reduced by certain collection costs\nthat are incurred only if collection efforts are successful for\nperiods prior to June 30, 2020.\n\n(5) Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses,\nsuch as changes in the allowance from acquisitions,\ndispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase\naccounting adjustments, etc.\n\n(6) The third quarter of 2020 includes an increase of\napproximately $116 million related to FX translation.\n\n(7) The second quarter of 2020 includes an increase of\napproximately $88 million related to FX translation.\n\n(8) The first quarter of 2020 includes a decrease of\napproximately $483 million related to FX translation.\n\n(9) The fourth quarter of 2019 includes an increase of\napproximately $86 million related to FX translation.\n\n(10) The third quarter of 2019 includes a decrease of\napproximately $65 million related to FX translation.\n\n(11) September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, December\n31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, excludes $5.5 billion, $5.8\nbillion, $4.0 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.9 billion,\nrespectively, of loans that are carried at fair value.\n\n(12) At June 30, 2020, the Corporate ACLUC includes a non-\nprovision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on\nperformance guarantees as of March 31, 2020.

The intended\npurpose of the final rule is\nto support the ability of\nfinancial institutions to\nprovide financial\nintermediation to businesses\nand households across a range\nof market conditions and\nreduce the possibility of\nfunding shocks compromising a\nfinancial institution\u2019s\nliquidity position. In\ngeneral, a bank\u2019s available\nstable funding will include\nportions of equity, deposits\nand long-term debt, while its\nrequired stable funding will\nbe based on the liquidity\ncharacteristics of its assets,\nderivatives and commitments.\nStandardized weightings will\nbe required to be applied to\nthe various asset and\nliabilities classes. The ratio\nof available stable funding to\nrequired stable funding will\nbe required to be greater than\n100%.

End-of-period loans\ndeclined 4% year-over-year and\n3% sequentially, on both a\nreported basis as well as\nexcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation. On an average\nbasis, loans declined 1% year-\nover-year and 4% sequentially.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, average loans\ndeclined 1% year-over-year and\n5% sequentially. On this\nbasis, average GCB loans\ndeclined 4% year-over-year,\nreflecting the impact of lower\ncustomer spending in Citi\u2019s\ncards businesses, higher\npayments by\n\ncustomers given government\nstimulus and a continuation of\nCiti\u2019s pause in proactive\nmarketing. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\naverage ICG loans increased 2%\nyear-over-year. Loans in\ncorporate lending grew 4% on\nan average basis, but were\ndown 14% sequentially,\nreflecting significant\nrepayments as Citi assisted\nits clients in accessing the\ncapital markets. Private bank\nloans increased 6%, largely\ndriven by residential real\nestate lending to Citi\u2019s high-\nnet-worth clients. TTS loans\ndecreased 7%, reflecting\nweakness in underlying trade\nflows and the continued low\nlevel of spend in commercial\ncards. Average Corporate/Othe\nr loans continued to decline\n(down 27%), driven by the\nwind-down of legacy assets.\nDeposits The table below\ndetails the average deposits,\nby business and/or segment,\nand the total end-of-period\ndeposits for each of the\nperiods indicated:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  billions                                                      \n  of               Sept. 30,         Jun. 30,        Sept. 30,  \n  dollars               2020             2020             2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Global                                                        \n  Consumer                                                      \n  Banking(\u2026                                                     \n  North        $       182.1    $       172.5    $       153.6  \n  America                                                       \n  Latin                 22.5             20.6             22.5  \n  America                                                       \n  Asia(2)              115.2            108.8            100.7  \n  Total        $       319.8    $       301.9    $       276.8  \n  Institut\u2026                                                     \n  Clients                                                       \n  Group                                                         \n  Treasury                                                      \n  and trade    $       678.6    $       667.5    $       541.0  \n  solutions                                                     \n  (TTS)                                                         \n  Bankinge\u2026            150.1            143.5            137.0  \n  Markets                                                       \n  and                  107.9            108.2             95.7  \n  securiti\u2026                                                     \n  services                                                      \n  Total        $       936.6    $       919.2    $       773.7  \n  Corporat\u2026    $        11.4    $        12.8    $        15.8  \n  Total                                                         \n  Citigroup    $     1,267.8    $     1,233.9    $     1,066.3  \n  deposits                                                      \n  (AVG)                                                         \n  Total                                                         \n  Citigroup    $     1,262.6    $     1,233.7    $     1,087.8  \n  deposits                                                      \n  (EOP)                                                         \n                                                                \n(1) Reflects deposits within\nretail banking.

For securities that\nare redeemable prior to\nmaturity at the option of the\nholder, the weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the earliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued\nto third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup)\nand Citi\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries (including\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries)\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup. As of September 30,\n2020, non-bank included $55.8\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries, as\nwell as certain Citigroup\nconsolidated hedging\nactivities. (2) Local country\nand other includes debt issued\nby Citi\u2019s affiliates in\nsupport of their local\noperations. Within non-bank,\ncertain secured financing is\nalso included. Within bank,\nborrowings under certain U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored liquidity\nprograms are also included.\n(3) Predominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Citi-branded credit\ncard receivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\nincreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the\nissuance of unsecured\nbenchmark senior debt and\ncustomer-related debt at the\nnon-bank entities, as well as\nan increase in FHLB borrowings\nat the bank, partially offset\nby declines in unsecured\nbenchmark senior debt and\nsecuritizations at the bank.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding decreased, driven\nprimarily by declines in\nunsecured benchmark senior\ndebt and securitizations at\nthe bank. As part of its\nliability management, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During the\nthird quarter of 2020, Citi\nredeemed or repurchased an\naggregate of approximately\n$7.1 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               69

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n\nSecured Funding Transactions\n\nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $207\nbillion as of September 30,\n2020 increased 6% from the\nprior-year period and declined\n4% sequentially. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nsecured funding increased 4%\nfrom the prior-year period and\ndeclined 6% sequentially, both\ndriven by normal business\nactivity. The average balances\nfor secured funding were\napproximately $217 billion for\nthe quarter ended September\n30, 2020.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $37 billion increased 6%\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by an increase in\ncommercial paper at both the\nbank and non-bank.\nSequentially, short-term\nborrowings declined by 7%,\nprimarily driven by a decline\nin FHLB advances (see Note 16\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               71                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014 Liquidity Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $0.6 billion,\ncompared to $0.5 billion as of\nJune 30, 2020. Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfinancing transactions and\nother margin requirements, for\nwhich there are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.4\nbillion, unchanged from June\n30, 2020.\n\nIn total, as of September 30,\n2020, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup and Citibank across\nall three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$1.0 billion, unchanged from\nJune 30, 2020 (see also Note\n19 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings from certain\nCitibank subsidiaries.\nMitigating actions available\nto Citibank include, but are\nnot limited to, selling or\nfinancing highly liquid\ngovernment securities,\ntailoring levels of secured\nlending, adjusting the size of\nselect trading assets,\nreducing loan originations and\nrenewals, raising additional\ndeposits or borrowing from the\nFHLB or central banks. Citi\nbelieves these mitigating\nactions could substantially\nreduce the funding and\nliquidity risk, if any, of the\npotential downgrades described\nabove.\n                               72                               \nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, Citibank\nhad liquidity commitments of\napproximately $11.4 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\ncompared to $11.0 billion as\nof June 30, 2020 (as\nreferenced in Note 18 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients\u2019 adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               73                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk emanates from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(140) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof September 30, 2020.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs shown in the table above,\nCiti increased its net\ninterest revenue exposure to\nan increase in interest rates.\nThe increase was predominantly\nin U.S. dollar exposure, which\nwas $65 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, primarily\ndriven by placement of an\nincrease in deposits into cash\nequivalents and investments.\n\nThe relatively small quarterly\nchange in the estimated impact\nto AOCI primarily reflected a\ncontinuation of the\npositioning strategy of Citi\nTreasury\u2019s investment\nsecurities and related\ninterest rate derivatives\nportfolio. In the event of a\nparallel instantaneous 100 bps\nincrease in interest rates,\nCiti expects that the negative\nimpact to AOCI would be offset\nin stockholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio over a period of\ntime. As of September 30,\n2020, Citi expects that the\nnegative $5.8 billion impact\nto AOCI in such a scenario\ncould potentially be offset\nover approximately 36 months.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under five\ndifferent changes in interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and Citi\u2019s other\ncurrencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d). The rate\nscenarios are also impacted by\nconvexity related to mortgage\nproducts.\n\nIn addition, in the table\nbelow, the magnitude of the\nimpact to Citi\u2019s net interest\nrevenue and AOCI is greater\nunder Scenario 2 as compared\nto Scenario 3. This is because\nthe combination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  of                                                            \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  ex\u2026                                                           \n  as                                                            \n  ot\u2026                                                           \n  no\u2026                                                           \n  Ov\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  10\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  an\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to        Sce\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026  \n  net          1          2           3          4           5  \n  in\u2026        100        100           \u2014          \u2014       (100)  \n  re\u2026        100          \u2014         100       (10\u2026       (100)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.\u2026    $    65    $    70    $     73    $  -153    $   -217  \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  All                                                           \n  ot\u2026        702        507          29        -29        -313  \n  cu\u2026                                                           \n  To\u2026    $   767    $   577    $    102    $  -182    $   -530  \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  -5,\u2026    $  -3,\u2026    $  -2,1\u2026    $  1,4\u2026    $  2,923  \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to                                                            \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  Eq\u2026        -36        -25         -14          8          12  \n  Ti\u2026                                                           \n  1                                                             \n  Ca\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur\ninstantaneously.

This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nAustralian dollar, Euro and\nSouth Korean won.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency translation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the impact\nof these changes on Citi\u2019s TCE\nand Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

Buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss excludes\nrealized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and\ncommissions, intra-day trading\nprofit and loss and changes in\nreserves. Based on a 99%\nconfidence level, Citi would\nexpect two to three days in\nany one year where buy-and-\nhold losses exceed the\nRegulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of\nCiti\u2019s VAR model (as a result\nof taking the greater of\nshort- and long-term\nvolatilities and fat-tail\nscaling of volatilities), Citi\nwould expect fewer exceptions\nunder normal and stable market\nconditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions\ncould increase the number of\nback-testing exceptions. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, there were\nfour back-testing exceptions\nobserved for Citi\u2019s Regulatory\nVAR for the prior 12 months.\nAll four exceptions occurred\nduring March 2020 and were\nrelated to market volatility\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n                               87                               \n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISK                                              \n                                                                \nFor additional information\nregarding operational risk,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of\noperational risk, see\n\u201cOperational Risk\u201d in Citi\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                                \n  Erroneous Revlon-Related Payment                              \n                                                                \nIn August 2020, Citi, as\nadministrative agent for a\nRevlon credit facility, in\naddition to making an interest\npayment, erroneously paid the\nlenders under the facility an\naggregate of approximately $894\nmillion, which is an amount\nequal to the principal balance\nof the loan at that time. Human\nerror at Citi and at a third-\nparty vendor, and limitations\nin Citi\u2019s loan processing\nsystems, were the main\ncontributing factors. After a\ncareful assessment of the\nincident, Citi immediately put\nin additional controls to\nprevent similar loan\ndisbursement errors in the\nfuture, while also embarking on\na major upgrade of the loan\ninfrastructure and controls.\n\nAs of November 4, 2020, $389.8\nmillion has been recovered from\nvarious lenders that received\nportions of the erroneous\npayment. The remaining balance\nof $504.2 million is accounted\nfor as a receivable in Other\nassets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet and, in\naccordance with ASC 450, Citi\nhas not recognized any\nimpairment on this receivable\nbecause it does not believe a\nloss is probable. Citi\ncommenced litigation against\ncertain fund managers of\nlenders that have not returned\nthe funds that were erroneously\nsent to them and obtained a\ntemporary restraining order\nagainst the fund managers and\nthose acting with them that\nfreezes those transferred\nfunds.

As of January 1,\n2021, the U.K. would be\ntreated as an autonomous\ncountry by the EU, with U.K.\nfirms no longer having\nautomatic access to the EU\u2019s\nsingle market.\n\nWhile the U.K. government and\nthe EU continue to negotiate a\nfree trade agreement, it\nremains uncertain whether the\nnegotiations will be\nsuccessfully concluded in time\nto take effect by the end of\nthe transition period.\nMoreover, the free trade\nagreement will likely cover\ntariffs and quotas for goods\nbut not services in the\nfinancial sector between the\nU.K. and the EU.\n\nAccordingly, Citi has\ncontinued to plan for a \u201cno\ndeal\u201d exit scenario. Citi has\nworked closely with clients,\nregulators and other relevant\nstakeholders in order to\nprovide continuity of services\nto its U.K. and EU clients.\nCiti has migrated certain\nbusiness activities to\nalternative legal entities and\nbranches with appropriate\nregulatory permissions to\ncarry out such activity, and\nhas established required\ncapabilities in the U.K. and\nEU.

In addition,\nCiti has developed regional\nbooking centers in certain\ncountries, most significantly\nin the United Kingdom (U.K.)\nand Ireland,\n\nin order to more efficiently\nserve its corporate customers.\nAs an example, for U.K.\nexposure, only 35% of\ncorporate loans presented in\nthe table below are to U.K.\ndomiciled entities (and 38% of\nunfunded lending commitments\nare to U.K. domiciled\nentities), with the balance of\nthe loans predominately\noutstanding to European\ndomiciled counterparties.\nApproximately 78% of the total\nU.K. funded loans and 84% of\nthe total U.K. unfunded\nlending commitments were\ninvestment grade as of\nSeptember 30, 2020. Trading\naccount assets and investment\nsecurities are generally\ncategorized based on the\ndomicile of the issuer of the\nsecurity of the underlying\nreference entity.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$910 million. Citi uses the\nU.S. dollar as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\nArgentina because the\nArgentine economy is\nconsidered highly inflationary\nunder U.S. GAAP. For\nadditional information about\nCiti\u2019s exposures in Argentina,\nsee \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nin Citi\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\nDuring August 2020, the\nArgentine government announced\nthe successful restructuring\nof almost all of its foreign\ncurrency debt issued under\nforeign law, for which it had\npreviously postponed principal\nand interest payments.\nHowever, during September\n2020, the Argentine government\ntightened its existing capital\nand currency controls, which\ncontinue to restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access U.S. dollars\nin Argentina and remit\nearnings from its Argentine\noperations.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of September\n30, 2020, the international\nNDF market had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge a significant portion of\nits Argentine peso exposure.\nAs a result, and to the extent\nthat Citi is unable to execute\nNDF contracts for this\nunhedged exposure in the\nfuture, Citi would record\ndevaluations on its net\nArgentine peso\u2010denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nany benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate\nallowances for credit losses\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\nsuch risks under U.S. GAAP as\nof September 30, 2020.\nHowever, given the recent\nevents in Argentina, U.S.\nregulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and\nin Citigroup\u2019s First Quarter\nof 2020 Form 10-Q contain a\nsummary of all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. These policies, as\nwell as estimates made by\nmanagement, are integral to\nthe presentation of Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition. While all\nof these policies require a\ncertain level of management\njudgment and estimates, this\nsection highlights and\ndiscusses the significant\naccounting policies that\nrequire management to make\nhighly difficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCitigroup\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nmajority of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repurchase\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repurchase\nagreements), a majority of\nwhich is carried at fair\nvalue. In addition, certain\nloans, short-term borrowings,\nlong-term debt and deposits,\nas well as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. These\n\njudgments have the potential\nto impact the Company\u2019s\nfinancial performance for\ninstruments where the changes\nin fair value are recognized\nin either the Consolidated\nStatement of Income or in AOCI\n.\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nare recognized in earnings.\nWhere Citi does not intend to\nsell the security nor could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nthe portion of the loss\nrelated to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAdjudicating the temporary\nnature of fair value\nimpairments is also inherently\njudgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                             \n                                                                \nCiti provides reserves for an\nestimate of current expected\ncredit losses in the funded\nloan portfolio and for the\nunfunded lending commitments,\nstandby letters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet in\nAllowance for credit losses on\nloans (ACLL) and Other\nliabilities , respectively. In\naddition, Citi provides\nallowances for an estimate of\ncurrent expected credit losses\nfor other financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost,\nincluding held-to-maturity\nsecurities, reverse repurchase\nagreements, securities\nborrowed, deposits with banks\nand other financial\nreceivables carried at\namortized cost (these\nallowances, together with the\nACLL, are referred to as the\nACL).\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. For the\nquantitative component, Citi\nuses a single forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast that is\ncomplemented by a qualitative\ncomponent. This qualitative\ncomponent reflects (i)\neconomic uncertainty related\nto an alternative downside\nscenario, (ii) loss\nadjustments for concentration\nand collateral, and (iii)\nspecific adjustments based on\nthe associated portfolio for\nestimating the ACL.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent based on (i) its\ninternal system of credit risk\nratings, (ii) its\ncomprehensive internal history\nand rating agency information\nregarding default rates and\nloss data, including internal\ndata on the severity of losses\nin the event of\n                               92                               \ndefault, and (iii) a\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast of future\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n\nCiti\u2019s expected credit loss is\ndetermined primarily by\nutilizing models for the\nborrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables that inform the\nforecasts. For wholesale\nportfolios, the loss\nlikelihood and loss severity\nmodels cover a wide range of\ngeography, industry, product\nand business segments that\ncontribute to the portfolios.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s\ndelinquency-managed portfolios\ncontaining smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans also use PD,\nLGD and EAD models to\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses and reserve balances\nbased on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies and changes in\nportfolio size, as well as\nother current economic factors\nand credit trends, including\nhousing prices, unemployment\nand gross domestic product\n(GDP). This methodology is\napplied separately for each\nproduct within each geographic\nregion in which these\nportfolios exist, including\nthe U.S., Mexico and Asia .\n\nThis evaluation process is\nsubject to numerous estimates\nand judgments. The frequency\nof default, risk ratings, loss\nrecovery rates, size and\ndiversity of individual large\ncredits and ability of\nborrowers with foreign\ncurrency obligations to obtain\nthe foreign currency necessary\nfor orderly debt servicing,\namong other things, are all\ntaken into account. Changes in\nthese estimates could have a\ndirect impact on Citi\u2019s credit\ncosts and the allowance in any\nperiod.\n                                                                \n  Qualitative Component                                         \n                                                                \nCiti uses a qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL to adjust\nfor economic uncertainty. The\nqualitative component\nconsiders, among other things,\nthe uncertainty of forward-\nlooking economic scenarios\nbased on the likelihood and\nseverity of a downside\nscenario, certain portfolio\ncharacteristics and\nconcentrations, collateral\ncoverage, model limitations,\nidiosyncratic events and other\nrelevant criteria under\nbanking supervisory guidance\nfor loan loss reserves. In the\ncurrent macroeconomic\nenvironment, the quantitative\nand qualitative components\nreflect the estimated impact\nof the pandemic on economic\nforecasts and the impact on\ncredit loss estimates.\n\nCiti\u2019s qualitative component\nalso includes a judgmental\nmanagement adjustment, which\nis an alternative, more\nadverse scenario that only\nconsiders downside risk.\n\n3Q20 Combined Quantitative and\nQualitative Components\n\nThe ACL reflects both the\nquantitative component and the\nqualitative component,\nincluding the judgmental\nmanagement adjustment, and\nincludes reserves for loans\nmodified under the CARES Act\nand U.S. banking agency relief\n(for additional information,\nsee \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOverview\u2014Troubled Debt\nRestructuring (TDR) Relief\u201d\nabove).\n\nIn the third quarter, Citi (i)\nreleased $0.2 billion of the\nACL for its consumer\nportfolios and (ii) built $0.5\nbillion of the ACL for its\ncorporate portfolios. Both\nconsumer and corporate ACLs\nwere impacted by lower loan\nbalances and some improvement\nin macroeconomic conditions\nfor the quantitative base\nscenario. In addition, the\ncorporate ACL reflected an\nimproved outlook in the third\nquarter for certain variables\nfor the base case, such as the\nVIX and oil prices. For the\nconsumer ACL, the change in\nthe estimate related to\nvariable third-party\ncollection costs, primarily\nfor its international cards\nportfolios, reduced the ACL by\n$122 million.\n\nIn the third quarter, the\nqualitative judgmental\nmanagement adjustment\nincorporated this alternative\ndownside scenario at a 15%\nlikelihood, which contributed\nto an increase in the\nProvision for credit losses of\napproximately $0.8 billion and\nending ACL reserves of $3.1\nbillion in the quarter, for an\noverall ACL balance of $28.9\nbillion at September 30, 2020.\nThis increase in the\njudgmental management\nadjustment was partially\noffset by lower loan volumes.\nWithout the management\nadjustment, Citi estimates it\nwould have had a $500 million\nrelease in the ACL. The\noutlook for many of the\nmacroeconomic variables, such\nas GDP and unemployment,\ncontinues to evolve.\n\nThe extent of the pandemic\u2019s\nultimate impact will depend,\namong other things, on (i) how\nconsumers respond to the\ngovernment stimulus and\nassistance, as well as Citi\u2019s\nown customer relief efforts;\n(ii) the impact on\nunemployment; (iii) the timing\nand extent of the economic\nrecovery; (iv) whether there\nis a resurgence of COVID-19,\nincluding as businesses and\nschools reopen and the extent\nof that resurgence; and (v)\nthe extent of any market\nvolatility. Citi believes its\nanalysis of the ACL reflects\nthe forward view of the\neconomic analysis as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, based on\nits September 8, 2020\nforecast.\n                               93                               \nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nuses a multitude of variables\nin its macroeconomic forecast\nas part of its calculation of\nboth the qualitative and\nquantitative components of the\nACL, including both domestic\nand international variables\nfor its global portfolios and\nexposures.

Under the quantitative\nbase scenario, Citi\u2019s 3Q20 forecasts are for U.S. unemployment\nto continue to improve as the U.S. moves past the peak of the\ncrisis, with a somewhat more muted and slower recovery in both\nunemployment and U.S. GDP through 2022, compared to the 2Q20\nforecasts. The downside scenario incorporates more adverse\neconomic variables, e.g., approximately 500 bps in higher\nunemployment rates through 2021 and a slower GDP recovery, which\nis 9% lower than the base case in 2021, compared with the second\nquarter outlook that was only 1% lower than the base case.\nConsumer As discussed above, Citi\u2019s total consumer ACL release\n(including Corporate/Other ) of $0.2 billion in the third\nquarter of 2020 reduced the ACL balance to $19.5 billion, or\n6.96% of total consumer loans, and reflected the update of the\nmacroeconomic forecast scenario for the third quarter. Citi\u2019s\nconsumer ACL is largely driven by the cards businesses, where\nthe receivables have longer estimated tenors under the CECL\nlifetime expected credit loss methodology, net of recoveries,\nthan under the previous incurred loss model. Citi\u2019s consumer ACL\nrelease included a one-time release of approximately $122\nmillion related to the change in\n\naccounting for third-party collection costs, primarily for\nCiti\u2019s international cards portfolios, as discussed below. For\ncards, the level of reserves relative to EOP loans increased to\n11.42% at September 30, 2020, compared to 11.21% at June 30,\n2020, primarily due to lower average loan balances. For the\nremaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to\nEOP loans decreased to 2.1% at September 30, 2020, compared to\n2.2% at June 30, 2020. Corporate Citi\u2019s corporate ACLL for\noutstanding loans increased $0.1 billion in the third quarter of\n2020, bringing the ACLL reserve balance to $6.9 billion, or\n1.82% of total funded loans, and reflected the update of the\nmacroeconomic forecast scenario for the third quarter. The\nhigher ACL build was primarily driven by an increase in the\nqualitative management adjustment component of the reserve to\nreflect the potential for a higher level of stress and/or\nsomewhat slower economic recovery. Mexico and Argentina were the\nkey contributors to the increase in the corporate ACL build,\npartially offset primarily by a U.S. release. The ACL for\nunfunded loans increased $0.4 billion in the third quarter,\nbringing the total corporate ACL reserve balance included in\nOther liabilities to $2.3 billion at September 30, 2020. Impact\nto ACL Estimate as a Result of a Voluntary Change in the\nAccounting for Variable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection\nCosts During the second quarter of 2020, there was a change in\nCiti\u2019s ACL accounting estimate effected by a change in Citi\u2019s\naccounting principle for variable post-charge-off third-party\ncollection costs. These costs were previously accounted for as a\nreduction in credit recoveries. As a result of this change,\nbeginning July 1, 2020, these costs are accounted for as an\nincrease in operating expenses. Determining a preferable method\nof accounting for such costs is a judgmental matter; however,\nCiti concluded that such a change in the method of accounting is\npreferable in Citi\u2019s circumstances as it better reflects the\nnature of these collection costs to investors. That is, these\ncosts do not represent reduced payments from borrowers and are\nsimilar to Citi\u2019s other executory third-party vendor contracts\nthat are accounted for as operating expenses as incurred. As a\nresult of this accounting change, Citi had a one-time consumer\nACL release of approximately $426 million in the second quarter\nof 2020 related to its U.S. card portfolios. This policy change\nimpacts the ACL estimate as the level of credit recoveries used\nin the ACL estimation process will increase as a result of the\ncollection costs being reclassified to operating expenses. Since\nthe validation of the models determining the impact of variable\npost-charge-off third-party collection costs primarily related\nto Citi\u2019s international card portfolios was not completed as of\nthe second quarter of 2020, Citi reflected this adjustment in\nits third quarter ACL provision to include an incremental\nrelease of $122 million. These ACL releases reflect the impact\nto Citi\u2019s ACL estimate of the revised credit recoveries\nincorporated in the ACL models. Aside from this impact on the\nACL estimation process, this change in\n                               94                               \naccounting also resulted in a\nreclassification of\napproximately $50 million of\ncollection costs from credit\nrecoveries to operating\nexpenses each quarter,\nbeginning in the third quarter\nof 2020.\n                                                                \n  ACL Sensitivity                                               \n                                                                \nTo the extent that the\nprobability of the downside\nscenario increases, a\ncorresponding increase in\nreserves would be expected. It\nis important to note the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 The above cannot be used to\nestimate the overall impact on\nthe ACL, as the amount of the\nqualitative component of the\nACL (including, but not\nlimited to, the economic\nuncertainty management\nadjustment) could be different\nunder alternative\nmacroeconomic scenarios and\nchanges in the portfolio.\n\n\u2022 The pandemic has had, and\nwill likely continue to have,\na severe impact on global\neconomic conditions and the\nvariability in macroeconomic\nvariables, and their impacts\non credit loss estimates could\nbe material.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt September 30, 2020, the\nratio of the allowance for\ncredit losses to total funded\nloans was 4.00% (6.96% for\nconsumer loans and 1.82% for\ncorporate loans), compared to\n3.89% at June 30, 2020 (6.97%\nfor consumer loans and 1.71%\nfor corporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $5.3 billion at September\n30, 2020, down $571 billion\nfrom June 30, 2020. Consumer\nnon-accrual loans decreased\n$139 million to $1.7 billion\nat September 30, 2020 from\n$1.8 billion at June 30, 2020,\nwhile corporate non-accrual\nloans decreased $432 million\nto $3.6 billion at September\n30, 2020 from $4.0 billion at\nJune 30, 2020. In addition,\nthe ratio of non-accrual loans\nto total corporate loans was\n0.93%, and 0.60% of non-\naccrual loans to total\nconsumer loans, at September\n30, 2020.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has elected to phase in\nthe CECL impact for regulatory\ncapital purposes. The\ntransition provisions were\nrecently modified to defer the\nphase-in. After two years with\nno impact on capital, the CECL\ntransition impact will phase\nin over a three-year\ntransition period with 25% of\nthe impact (net of deferred\ntaxes) recognized on the first\nday of each subsequent year,\ncommencing January 1, 2022,\nand will be fully implemented\non January 1, 2025. In\naddition, 25% of the build\n(pretax) made in 2020 will be\ndeferred and amortized through\nthe same timeframe.\n\nFor a further description of\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses and related accounts,\nsee Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor a discussion of the\nrecently adopted CECL\naccounting pronouncement, see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually as of July\n1 (the annual test) and\nthrough interim assessments\nbetween annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more-likely-\nthan-not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its\ncarrying amount, such as a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsignificant decline in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nCiti performed the annual test\nas of July 1, 2020. The fair\nvalues of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units as a\npercentage of their carrying\nvalues ranged from\napproximately 115% to 136%,\nresulting in no impairment.\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, the current\nenvironment remains rapidly\nevolving due to the COVID-19\npandemic. Further\ndeterioration in macroeconomic\nand market conditions,\nincluding potential adverse\neffects to economic forecasts\ndue to the severity and\nduration of the pandemic, as\nwell as the responses of\ngovernments, customers and\nclients, could negatively\ninfluence the assumptions used\nin the valuations, in\nparticular, the discount and\ngrowth rates used in the net\nincome projections. If the\nfuture were to differ from\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of\nkey economic assumptions, and\nassociated cash flows were to\ndecrease, Citi could\npotentially experience\nmaterial goodwill impairment\ncharges in the future.

Net DTAs\narising from temporary differences are deducted from regulatory\ncapital if in excess of the 10%/15% limitations (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d above). For the quarter ended September 30, 2020,\nCiti did not have any such DTAs. Accordingly, the remaining\n$15.2 billion of net DTAs as of September 30, 2020 was not\ndeducted in calculating regulatory capital pursuant to Basel III\nstandards and was appropriately risk weighted under those rules.\n\nDTA Realizability Citi believes that the realization of the\nrecognized net DTAs of $24.8 billion at September 30, 2020 is\nmore-likely-than-not based upon management\u2019s expectations as to\nfuture taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs\narise, as well as consideration of available tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ). In the\nthird quarter of 2020, there was no change in Citi\u2019s DTA\nvaluation allowance (VA) requirements for foreign tax credit\ncarry-forwards. In the fourth quarter of 2020, as part of its\nnormal planning process, Citi expects to update its forecasts of\noperating income and foreign source income, which in turn can\naffect the VA. Effective Tax Rate Citi\u2019s reported effective tax\nrate for the third quarter of 2020 was approximately 20%,\ncompared to approximately 18% in the third quarter of 2019.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of September 30,\n2020 and for the three- and-\nnine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019\ninclude the accounts of\nCitigroup Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries. In\nthe opinion of management, all\nadjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded in Citigroup\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31,\n2019 (2019 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K) and Citigroup\u2019s\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended March\n31, 2020 (First Quarter of\n2020 Form 10-Q) and for the\nsecond quarter ended June 30,\n2020 (Second Quarter of 2020\nForm 10-Q). Certain financial\ninformation that is normally\nincluded in annual financial\nstatements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), but is not required\nfor interim reporting\npurposes, has been condensed\nor omitted. Management must\nmake estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the\nrelated footnote disclosures.\nWhile management uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications have been\nmade to the prior periods\u2019\nfinancial statements and notes\nto conform to the current\nperiod\u2019s presentation. SUMMARY\nOF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES See Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in both Citigroup\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K and Citigroup\u2019s First\nQuarter of 2020 Form 10-Q for\na summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting\nfor Financial Instruments \u2014\nCredit Losses Overview In June\n2016, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) issued\nASU No. 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments \u2014 Credit Losses\n(Topic 326). The ASU\nintroduced a new credit loss\nmethodology, the Current\nExpected Credit Losses (CECL)\nmethodology, which requires\nearlier recognition of credit\nlosses while also providing\nadditional transparency about\ncredit risk. Citi adopted the\nASU as of January 1, 2020,\nwhich, as discussed below,\nresulted in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s Allowance for credit\nlosses and a decrease to\nopening Retained earnings ,\nnet of deferred income taxes,\nat January 1, 2020. The CECL\nmethodology utilizes a\nlifetime \u201cexpected credit\nloss\u201d measurement objective\nfor the recognition of credit\nlosses for loans, held-to-\nmaturity debt securities,\nreceivables and other\nfinancial assets measured at\namortized cost at the time the\nfinancial asset is originated\nor acquired. The allowance for\ncredit losses is adjusted each\nperiod for changes in expected\nlifetime credit losses. The\nCECL methodology represents a\nsignificant change from prior\nU.S. GAAP and replaced the\nprior multiple existing\nimpairment methods, which\ngenerally required that a loss\nbe incurred before it was\nrecognized. Within the life\ncycle of a loan or other\nfinancial asset, the\nmethodology generally results\nin the earlier recognition of\nthe provision for credit\nlosses and the related\nallowance for credit losses\nthan prior U.S. GAAP. For\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities where fair value is\nless than cost that Citi\nintends to hold or more-\nlikely-than-not will not be\nrequired to sell, credit-\nrelated impairment, if any, is\nrecognized through an\nallowance for credit losses\nand adjusted each period for\nchanges in credit risk.\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL\nTransition (Day 1) Impact The\nCECL methodology\u2019s impact on\nexpected credit losses, among\nother things, reflects Citi\u2019s\nview of the current state of\nthe economy, forecasted\nmacroeconomic conditions and\nCiti\u2019s portfolios. At the\nJanuary 1, 2020 date of\nadoption, based on forecasts\nof macroeconomic conditions\nand exposures at that time,\nthe aggregate impact to Citi\nwas an approximate $\n4.1billion, or an approximate\n29%, pretax increase in the\nAllowance for credit losses ,\nalong with a $ 3.1billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained\nearnings and a deferred tax\nasset increase of $\n1.0billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $\n4.9billion build to the\nAllowance for credit losses\nfor Citi\u2019s consumer exposures,\nprimarily driven by the impact\non credit card receivables of\nlonger estimated tenors under\nthe CECL lifetime expected\ncredit loss methodology (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n23months) compared to shorter\nestimated tenors under the\nprobable loss methodology\nunder prior U.S. GAAP (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n14months), net of recoveries;\nand (ii) a release of $\n0.8billion of reserves\nprimarily related to Citi\u2019s\ncorporate net loan loss\nexposures, largely due to more\nprecise contractual maturities\nthat result in\n                              110                               \nshorter remaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of\nmore specific historical loss data based on an increase in\nportfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. Under\nthe CECL methodology, the Allowance for credit losses consists\nof quantitative and qualitative components. Citi\u2019s quantitative\ncomponent of the Allowance for credit losses is model based and\nutilizes a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast,\ncomplemented by the qualitative component described below, in\nestimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the\ncorporate classifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and\nsupportable forecast periods vary by product. For example,\nCiti\u2019s consumer models use a 13-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period and revert to historical loss experience\nthereafter, while its corporate loan models use a nine-quarter\nreasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter\ngraduated transition to historical loss experience. Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the Allowance for credit losses\nconsiders (i) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios based\non the likelihood and severity of a possible recession as\nanother possible scenario; (ii) certain portfolio\ncharacteristics, such as portfolio concentration and collateral\ncoverage; and (iii) model limitations as well as idiosyncratic\nevents. Citi calculates a judgmental management adjustment,\nwhich is an alternative, more adverse scenario that only\nconsiders downside risk. Subsequent Measurement of Goodwill In\nJanuary 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles \u2014\nGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for\nGoodwill Impairment . The ASU simplifies the subsequent\nmeasurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating the\nrequirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill\n(i.e., previously referred to as step 2 of the goodwill\nimpairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Under\nthe ASU, the impairment test is the comparison of the fair value\nof a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with the\nimpairment charge being the deficit in fair value, but not\nexceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit. The simplified one-step impairment test applies\nto all reporting units (including those with zero or negative\ncarrying amounts). The ASU was adopted by Citi as of January 1,\n2020 with prospective application and did not impact the first,\nsecond or third quarters of 2020 results. The future impact of\nthe ASU will depend upon the performance of Citi\u2019s reporting\nunits and the market conditions impacting the fair value of each\nreporting unit going forward. Reference Rate Reform In March\n2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform\n(Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional guidance\nto ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing\nthe effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting.\nSpecifically, the guidance permits an entity, when certain\ncriteria are met, to consider amendments to contracts made to\ncomply with reference rate reform to meet the definition of a\nmodification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows hedge accounting\nto be maintained and a one-time transfer or sale of qualifying\nheld-to-maturity securities. The expedients and exceptions\nprovided by the amendments are permitted to be adopted any time\nthrough December 31, 2022 and do not apply to contract\nmodifications made and hedging relationships entered into or\nevaluated after December 31, 2022, except for certain optional\nexpedients elected for certain hedging relationships existing as\nof December 31, 2022. The ASU was adopted by Citi as of June 30,\n2020 with prospective application and did not impact results in\nthe second or third quarter of 2020. Voluntary Change in the\nAccounting for Variable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection\nCosts During the second quarter of 2020, there was a change in\nCiti\u2019s ACL accounting estimate effected by a change in Citi\u2019s\naccounting principle for variable post-charge-off third-party\ncollection costs. These costs were previously accounted for as a\nreduction in credit recoveries. As a result of this change,\nbeginning July 1, 2020, these costs are accounted for as an\nincrease in operating expenses. Determining a preferable method\nof accounting for such costs is a judgmental matter; however,\nCiti concluded that such a change in the method of accounting is\npreferable in Citi\u2019s circumstances as it better reflects the\nnature of these collection costs to investors. That is, these\ncosts do not represent reduced payments from borrowers and are\nsimilar to Citi\u2019s other executory third-party vendor contracts\nthat are accounted for as operating expenses as incurred. As a\nresult of this accounting change, Citi had a one-time consumer\nACL release of approximately $ 426million in the second quarter\nof 2020 related to its U.S. card portfolios. This policy change\nimpacts the ACL estimate as the level of credit recoveries used\nin the ACL estimation process will increase as a result of the\ncollection costs being reclassified to operating expenses. Since\nthe validation of the models determining the impact of variable\npost-charge-off third-party collection costs primarily related\nto Citi\u2019s international card portfolios was not completed as of\nthe second quarter of 2020, Citi reflected this adjustment in\nits third quarter ACL provision to include an incremental\nrelease of $ 122million. These ACL releases reflect the impact\nto Citi\u2019s ACL estimate of the revised credit recoveries\nincorporated in the ACL models.

In most of Citi\u2019s partner-sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa.

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value, as described in Notes 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The remaining portion is\ncarried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities\nloaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount\ngenerally in excess of the market value of the securities\nloaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities\nborrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or\nposts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection. The following tables present the gross and\nnet resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing\nand lending agreements and the related offsetting amounts\npermitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts\nrelated to financial instruments that are not permitted to be\noffset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting\nto the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal\nopinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has\nbeen obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by\nfinancial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or\nbeen able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of\nthe offsetting right.\n

An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under business policies. The sections\nbelow describe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected\ncredit impairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of September 30, 2020.\nMortgage-Backed Securities Citi records no allowances for credit\nlosses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities, because the Company expects to incur no credit\nlosses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no\ncredit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties. State\nand Municipal Securities The process for estimating credit\nlosses in Citigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily\nbased on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit\nratings. Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers\nproviding default protection in the form of financial guarantee\ninsurance. The average external credit rating, ignoring any\ninsurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating\ndowngrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based\non instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of\nissuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for\nadverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell, or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is\nrecognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where\nCiti has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an\nallowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects\nnot to collect, capped at the difference between the bond\u2019s\namortized cost basis and fair value. Equity Method Investments\nManagement assesses equity method investments that have fair\nvalues that are less than their respective carrying values for\nother-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured\nas price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly\nlisted securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other\nmethods are used (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). For impaired equity method investments that Citi\nplans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair\nvalue will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized in earnings as OTTI regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value.

Equity\nSecurities Not Carried at Fair\nValue Non-marketable equity\nsecurities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.\nImpairment indicators that are\nconsidered include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n\u2022 a significant deterioration\nin the earnings performance,\ncredit rating, asset quality\nor business prospects of the\ninvestee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the\nregulatory, economic or\ntechnological environment of\nthe investee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the general\nmarket condition of either the\ngeographical area or the\nindustry in which the investee\noperates; \u2022 a bona fide offer\nto purchase, an offer by the\ninvestee to sell or a\ncompleted auction process for\nthe same or similar investment\nfor an amount less than the\ncarrying amount of that\ninvestment; and \u2022 factors that\nraise significant concerns\nabout the investee\u2019s ability\nto continue as a going\nconcern, such as negative cash\nflows from operations, working\ncapital deficiencies or\nnoncompliance with statutory\ncapital requirements or debt\ncovenants. When the\nqualitative assessment\nindicates that impairment\nexists, the investment is\nwritten down to fair value,\nwith the full difference\nbetween the fair value of the\ninvestment and its carrying\namount recognized in earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at September 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019:\n                                                                \n  In millions of         September 30,                          \n  dollars                         2020       December 31, 2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value      $            865    $                700  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative:\n                                                                \n  In                Three                      Nine             \n  millio\u2026          Months                    Months             \n  of                Ended                     Ended             \n  dollars       September                  Septemb\u2026             \n  Measur\u2026             30,                       30,             \n  altern\u2026            2020       2019           2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impair\u2026    $          2    $     1    $        55    $     9  \n  losses                                                        \n  Downwa\u2026                                                       \n  changes                                                       \n  for                   \u2014          4             19         16  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n  Upward                                                        \n  changes                                                       \n  for                  40         23             82        108  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on these nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                    September 30, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                           67  \n  Downward changes for                                      52  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       424  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

Investments in such\nfunds are generally classified\nas non-marketable equity\nsecurities carried at fair\nvalue. The fair values of\nthese investments are\nestimated using the NAV of the\nCompany\u2019s ownership interest\nin the funds. Some of these\ninvestments are in \u201ccovered\nfunds\u201d for purposes of the\nVolcker Rule, which prohibits\ncertain proprietary investment\nactivities and limits the\nownership of, and\nrelationships with, covered\nfunds.

Default is defined as 60days past due, except for\nclassifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is\ndefined as 90days past due.\n                                                                \n                     TDR                          T\u2026            \n                     lo\u2026                          l\u2026            \n                     in                           in            \n                     pa\u2026                          p\u2026            \n                     de\u2026                          d\u2026            \n           TDR       Th\u2026       N\u2026       TDR       T\u2026       Ni\u2026  \n           ba\u2026       Mo\u2026       M\u2026       ba\u2026       M\u2026       Mo\u2026  \n  In        at       En\u2026       E\u2026        at       E\u2026       En\u2026  \n  m\u2026       Se\u2026       Se\u2026       S\u2026       Se\u2026       S\u2026       Se\u2026  \n  of       30,       30,       3\u2026       30,       3\u2026       30,  \n  d\u2026       20\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026       2\u2026       20\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  C\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026    $  390    $  \u2014      $  \u2014     $  591    $   2    $   23  \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026         \u2014       \u2014         \u2014          9        \u2014         \u2014  \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  M\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026        98       \u2014         \u2014         75        \u2014         \u2014  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  O\u2026        22       \u2014         \u2014          4        \u2014         \u2014  \n  T\u2026    $  510    $  \u2014      $  \u2014     $  679    $   2    $   23  \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding that\nwere considered TDRs as of the end of the reporting period.\n                              151                               \n                                                                \n  14.

variable post-charge-off third-party\nagency collection costs in its U.S. cards portfolios. After June\n30, 2020, these costs are recorded as operating expenses for\nfuture periods as they are incurred. The impact of this change\nin estimate effected by a change in accounting principle\nresulted in an approximate $ 426million reduction in Citi's\nestimated ACLL at June 30, 2020. During the third quarter of\n2020, Citi updated its ACLL estimate of lifetime credit losses\nresulting from a change in accounting estimate effected by a\nchange in accounting principle for variable post-charge-off\nthird-party agency collection costs, primarily in its\ninternational cards portfolios. After June 30, 2020, these costs\nare recorded as operating expenses for future periods as they\nare incurred. The impact of this change in estimate effected by\na change in accounting principle resulted in an approximate $\n122million reduction in Citi's estimated ACLL at September 30,\n2020.\n(4) Represents additional credit loss reserves for unfunded\nlending commitments and letters of credit recorded in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(5) The nine months ended September 30, 2020 includes a non-\nprovision transfer of $ 68million, representing reserves on\nperformance guarantees as of March 31, 2020. The reserves on\nthese contracts have been reclassified out of the allowance for\ncredit losses on unfunded lending commitments and into other\nliabilities beginning June 30, 2020.\n(6) Primarily related to consumer.

The fair values of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units as percentage of their carrying values ranged\nfrom approximately 115% to 136%, resulting in no impairment.\nWhile the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in\nthe key assumptions used in the valuations, the current\nenvironment remains rapidly evolving due to the COVID-19\npandemic. Further deterioration in macroeconomic and market\nconditions, including potential adverse effects to economic\nforecasts due to the severity and duration of the pandemic, as\nwell as the responses of governments, customers, and clients,\ncould negatively influence the assumptions used in the\nvaluations, in particular, the discount and growth rates used in\nthe net income projections. If the future were to differ from\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of key economic assumptions, and\nassociated cash flows were to decrease, Citi could potentially\nexperience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.\nFor additional information regarding Citi\u2019s goodwill impairment\ntesting process, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s

December 31,\n2019 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the\nCompany has any variable interest or continuing involvement\nconsidered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 74.8billion and $\n69billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 710million and $\n711million in maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019, respectively.\n                              165                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $\n53.7billion and $ 52.5billion, respectively. (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K); \u2022\ncertain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company\nholds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on\narm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities held by the Company, which are classified as\nTrading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has\nno other involvement with the related securitization entity\ndeemed to be significant (for more information on these\npositions, see Notes 13 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements); \u2022 certain representations and warranties exposures\nin legacy ICG -sponsored mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecuritizations in which the Company has no variable interest or\ncontinuing involvement as servicer. The outstanding balance of\nmortgage loans securitized during 2005 to 2008 in which the\nCompany has no variable interest or continuing involvement as\nservicer was approximately $ 5.4billion and $ 6billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively; \u2022\ncertain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have\na variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the legal form of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the Company\u2019s standard accounting policies for the\nasset type and line of business. The asset balances for\nunconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant\ninvolvement represent the most current information available to\nthe Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an\namortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair\nvalue information is readily available to the Company. The\nmaximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying\namount of the Company\u2019s investment in the VIE. It reflects the\ninitial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any\naccrued interest and cash principal payments received. The\ncarrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines\nin fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings.\nThe maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the\nremaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and\ncredit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount\nof a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest.\nIn certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative\ninstruments or other arrangements that are not considered\nvariable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit\nprotection under a credit default swap or total return swap\nwhere the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the\nSPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in\nthe maximum exposure amounts.\n                              166                               \nFunding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated\nVIEs\u2014Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments\nThe following table presents the notional amount of liquidity\nfacilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding\ncommitments in the VIE tables above:\n                                                                \n               Septem\u2026                    Decemb\u2026               \n                   30,                        31,               \n                  2020                       2019               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  milli\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026  \n  of           facili\u2026       commi\u2026       facili\u2026       commi\u2026  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Asset\u2026    $        \u2014    $   9,748    $        \u2014    $   9,524  \n  finan\u2026                                                        \n  Munic\u2026                                                        \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  tender                                                        \n  option         1,869            \u2014         3,544            \u2014  \n  bond                                                          \n  trusts                                                        \n  (TOBs)                                                        \n  Munic\u2026             \u2014        2,763             \u2014        3,034  \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  Inves\u2026             \u2014           16             \u2014           16  \n  funds                                                         \n  Other              \u2014            \u2014             \u2014           39  \n  Total                                                         \n  fundi\u2026    $    1,869    $  12,527    $    3,544    $  12,613  \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of          September 30,           December 31,  \n  dollars                          2020                   2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash               $                \u2014    $                 \u2014  \n  Trading account                   2.1                    2.6  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                      10.1                    9.9  \n  Total loans,                                                  \n  net of                           27.5                   26.7  \n  allowance                                                     \n  Other                             0.3                    0.5  \n  Total assets       $             40.0    $              39.7  \n                                                                \nCredit Card Securitizations Substantially all of the Company\u2019s\ncredit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Master Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial\nmajority through the Master Trust.

Substantially\nall of the funding of the\nconduits is in the form of\nshort-term commercial paper.\nAt September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, the\nweighted average remaining\nlives of the commercial paper\nissued by the conduits were\napproximately 63and 49days,\nrespectively. The primary\ncredit enhancement provided to\nthe conduit investors is in\nthe form of transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements\ndescribed above. In addition\nto the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements, the\nconduits, other than the\ngovernment guaranteed loan\nconduit, have obtained a\nletter of credit from the\nCompany, which is equal to at\nleast 8% to 10% of the\nconduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The\nletters of credit provided by\nthe Company to the conduits\ntotal approximately $\n1.5billion and $ 1.4billion as\nof September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019,\nrespectively. The net result\nacross multi-seller conduits\nadministered by the Company is\nthat, in the event that\ndefaulted assets exceed the\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancements described above,\nany losses in each conduit are\nallocated first to the Company\nand then to the commercial\npaper investors.

Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from market\nfluctuations (i.e., market\nrisk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or\nperiods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e.,\nliquidity risk), as well as\nany market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              175                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019. Gross\npositive fair values are\noffset against gross negative\nfair values by counterparty,\npursuant to enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. As a\nresult, the tables reflect a\nreduction of approximately $\n270billion and $ 180billion as\nof September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019,\nrespectively, of derivative\nassets and derivative\nliabilities that previously\nwould have been reported on a\ngross basis, but are now\nlegally settled and not\nsubject to collateral. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              176

For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\nCitigroup has executed a last-\nof-layer hedge, which permits\nan entity to hedge the\ninterest rate risk of a stated\nportion of a closed portfolio\nof prepayable financial assets\nthat are expected to remain\noutstanding for the designated\ntenor of the hedge. In\naccordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment\nrisk when measuring the change\nin fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk under the last-of-\nlayer approach. Similar to\nother fair value hedges, where\nthe hedged item is an asset,\nthe fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk will be presented in\nInterest revenue along with\nthe change in the fair value\nof the hedging instrument.\n\nHedging of Foreign Exchange\nRisk Citigroup hedges the\nchange in fair value\nattributable to foreign\nexchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt\nthat are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the\nentity holding the securities\nor issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nCitigroup considers the\npremium associated with\nforward contracts (i.e., the\ndifferential between the spot\nand contractual forward rates)\nas the cost of hedging; this\namount is excluded from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally\nreflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge.\nCiti also excludes changes in\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the value\nof the hedged inventory is\nreflected in earnings, which\noffsets the change in the fair\nvalue of the futures contract\nthat is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedging instrument recorded in\nearnings includes changes in\nforward rates, Citigroup\nexcludes the differential\nbetween the spot and the\ncontractual forward rates\nunder the futures contract\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, and it is\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in forward rates from\nthe assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income.\n                              179                               \nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the\nCompany\u2019s fair value hedges:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         3       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are\nincluded in Interest income/Interest expense .

These cash flow hedging relationships\nuse either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis\nto assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective\nat inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of September 30, 2020\nis approximately $ 988million. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10years. The pretax\nchange in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below.

settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at both\nSeptember 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 was $\n28billion and $ 30billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 24billion and $\n28billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019,\nrespectively. A downgrade\ncould trigger additional\ncollateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company\nand certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and\nCitibank were downgraded a\nsingle notch by all threemajor\nrating agencies as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n0.8billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 0.2billion upon the\nsingle notch downgrade,\nresulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$ 1billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nboth the asset amounts\nderecognized and the gross\ncash proceeds received as of\nthe date of derecognition were\n$ 1.5billion and $ 5.8billion\nas of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019,\nrespectively. At September 30,\n2020, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 1.6billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of September 30, 2020\nwas $ 41million recorded as\ngross derivative assets and $\n23million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2019, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n5.9billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 117million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n43million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              184                               \n20.

unobservable.\nObservable inputs are developed using market data and reflect\nmarket participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs\nreflect the Company\u2019s market assumptions. These two types of\ninputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level\n1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active and model-derived valuations in\nwhich all significant inputs and significant value drivers are\nobservable in active markets. \u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable . As required under\nthe fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and\nobservable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The\nfrequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread and\nthe amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar\ntransactions are all factors in determining the relevance of\nobserved prices in those markets.\n                              185                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at September 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019. The Company may hedge positions that have been classified\nin the Level 3 category with other financial instruments\n(hedging instruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but\nalso with financial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2\nof the fair value hierarchy.

See Notes 17 and 20\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                              204                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . Among other\nvariables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and\nsimilar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of\nthe Company\u2019s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair\nvalue of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in\nthe Company\u2019s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit\nrisk) were a loss of $ 452million and a gain of $ 273million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and a gain\nof $ 801million and a loss of $ 449million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in fair\nvalue resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk\nwere estimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit\nspreads observable in the bond market into the relevant\nvaluation technique used to value each liability as described\nabove. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial\nLiabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain\nUncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the\nfair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income\nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nborrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-\nterm borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the\nelection was made because the related interest rate risk is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting\nderivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings. Changes in fair value for transactions in\nthese portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The\nrelated interest revenue and interest expense are measured based\non the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are\nreported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans and Other Credit\nProducts Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for\ncertain other originated and purchased loans, including certain\nunfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of\ncredit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses.\nNone of these credit products are highly leveraged financing\ncommitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans\nand unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold\nor securitized in the near term, or transactions where the\neconomic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as\npurchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the\nCompany pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third\nparty. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate\naccounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex\nand to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not\nelected for most lending transactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n

above, $ 1,068million and $\n1,062million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the nine months ended September 30,\n2020 and 2019 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to\na loss of $( 23) million and a gain of $ 95million,\nrespectively. Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals\nCitigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold,\nsilver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity and\nforeign currency trading activities or to economically hedge\ncertain exposures from issuing structured liabilities. Under ASC\n815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and\na commodity forward derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the\nfair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the\ndebt host contract within Trading account assets on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount\nof debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals\naccounts was approximately $ 0.5billion and $ 0.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The\namounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in\nfuture periods. As part of its commodity and foreign currency\ntrading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals\ninvestments and executes forward purchase and forward sale\nderivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi\nsells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi\u2019s\nreceivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, there were approximately $ 13.9billion and $\n11.0billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures\nCitigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for\nthe purpose of earning investment returns and for capital\nappreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for\ncertain of these ventures, because such investments are\nconsidered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

Certain Structured Liabilities The Company has\nelected the fair value option for certain structured liabilities\nwhose performance is linked to structured interest rates,\ninflation, currency, equity, referenced credit or commodity\nrisks. The Company elected the fair value option because these\nexposures are considered to be trading-related positions and,\ntherefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions\nwill continue to be classified as debt, deposits or derivatives\n( Trading account liabilities ) on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet according to their legal form.\nThe following table provides information about the carrying\nvalue of structured notes, disaggregated by type of embedded\nderivative instrument:\n                                                                \n  In billions of         September 30,                          \n  dollars                         2020       December 31, 2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Interest rate       $           20.1    $               22.6  \n  linked                                                        \n  Foreign exchange                 1.1                     0.7  \n  linked                                                        \n  Equity linked                   25.2                    23.7  \n  Commodity linked                 2.0                     1.8  \n  Credit linked                    2.5                     0.9  \n  Total               $           50.9    $               49.7  \n                                                                \nThe portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes\nin Citigroup\u2019s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a\ncomponent of AOCI while all other changes in fair value are\nreported in Principal transactions . Changes in the fair value\nof these structured liabilities include accrued interest, which\nis also included in the change in fair value reported in\nPrincipal transactions . Certain Non-Structured Liabilities The\nCompany has elected the fair value option for certain non-\nstructured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates.\nThe Company has elected the fair value option where the interest\nrate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with\nderivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase\nfinancial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings. The elections have been made to mitigate\naccounting mismatches and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.

For certain\ncontracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum\npotential future payments is\nbased on the notional\n\namount of the guarantees\nwithout consideration of\npossible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged.

lending indemnifications\nand credit card merchant processing were not material for either\nperiod presented, as the probability of potential liabilities\narising from these guarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be $ 97billion and $\n92billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum\nexposure is not representative of the actual potential loss\nexposure based on its historical experience. This contingent\nliability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services\nare delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items\nare returned to merchants.\n                              208                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 33million and $ 37million at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and\nthese amounts are included in Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Card Arrangements with\nPartners Citi, in one of its credit card partner arrangements,\nprovides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of\ncertain customer originations during the term of the agreement.\nTo the extent that such origination targets are not met, the\nguarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments\nthat otherwise would have been generated in connection with such\noriginations. Other Guarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card\nProtection Programs Citi, through its credit card businesses,\nprovides various cardholder protection programs on several of\nits card products, including programs that provide insurance\ncoverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated\nwith purchased products, price protection for certain purchases\nand protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not\nincluded in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the\nguarantees and Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be\nquantified. The protection is limited to certain types of\npurchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the\npurchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given\ntime. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential\nliability related to these programs based on the extent and\nnature of its historical loss experience. At September 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019, the actual and estimated losses incurred\nand the carrying value of Citi\u2019s obligations related to these\nprograms were immaterial. Value-Transfer Networks (Including\nExchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or\nshareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs)\n(payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges)\naround the world. As a condition of membership, many of these\nVTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of\nthe losses incurred by the organization due to another member\u2019s\ndefault on its obligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be\nlimited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions\nto the VTN\u2019s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro\nrata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as\nthis would require an assessment of claims that have not yet\noccurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote\ngiven historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of September 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification\nIn 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary\nof Citi, entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the\nrisks and rewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE\nLife (now Genworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a\nsubsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE). As part of this\ntransaction, the reinsurance obligations were provided by two\nregulated insurance subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two\ncollateral trusts with securities. Presently, as discussed\nbelow, the trusts are referred to as the Genworth Trusts. As\npart of GE\u2019s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks\nand rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance\nagreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth\nthrough GE\u2019s Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC)\nsubsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition,\nGE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC\nthat is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay\nits reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance\nagreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has\nreinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has\nreinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC\npolicies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations\nnow benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While\nneither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the\ncapital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse\nand Citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital\nmaintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will\ncontinue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance\nobligations to Genworth. In connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of\nTravelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an\nindemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder\nclaims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the\nTravelers LTC policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by\nsubsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail\ninsurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers\nLTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original\nreinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and\nGenworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole\nbeneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are\ndesigned to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal\nto the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the\nTravelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are\nevaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair\nvalue of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount\nequal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the\nliabilities change over time.\n                              209                               \nIf both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original\nTravelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason,\nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the\ntwoGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 related to this indemnification.\nHowever, if both events become reasonably possible (meaning more\nthan remote but less than probable), Citi will be required to\nestimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of\nloss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In\naddition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required\nto accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable\naccounting principles. Citi continues to closely monitor its\npotential exposure under this indemnification obligation, given\nGE\u2019s 2018 LTC and other charges and the September 2019 AM Best\ncredit ratings downgrade for the Genworth subsidiaries.\nSeparately, Genworth announced that it had agreed to be\npurchased by China Oceanwide Holdings Co., Ltd, subject to a\nseries of conditions and regulatory approvals. Citi is\nmonitoring these developments. Futures and Over-the-Counter\nDerivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on central\nclearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-\ntraded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts with\nCCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has\nconcluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in\nits role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 19 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually\nagreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the\nclient all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions\non the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right\nas a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets,\n(iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client\nfor the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and\n(iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin\ncollected and remitted in this manner was approximately $\n16.4billion and $ 13.3billion as of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, respectively. Variation margin due from\nclients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients,\nreflects changes in the value of the client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is\nexposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure\nof a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In\nthe event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to\nclose out the client\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically\nutilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP,\nwith any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as\nclearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or\nsecurities margin posted by the client, which would typically be\nexpected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the\nevent the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 2.3billion and $\n1.2billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 47.5billion and $\n46.7billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 72.0billion and $ 58.6billion at\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The\nmajority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized\nunder securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters\nof credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $\n6.5billion and $ 4.4billion at September 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, respectively. Other property may also be available to\nCiti to cover losses under certain guarantees and\nindemnifications; however, the value of such property has not\nbeen determined.\n                              210                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

Unsettled Reverse\nRepurchase and Securities\nBorrowing Agreements and\nUnsettled Repurchase and\nSecurities Lending Agreements\nIn addition, in the normal\ncourse of business, Citigroup\nenters into reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nSeptember 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, Citigroup\nhad approximately $\n68.8billion and $ 34.0billion\nof unsettled reverse\nrepurchase and securities\nborrowing agreements, and\napproximately $ 62.0billion\nand $ 38.7billion of unsettled\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements,\nrespectively.

For purposes of this\nNote, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nthe litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, in Note 23 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of Citigroup\u2019s\nSecond Quarter of 2020 Form\n10-Q and First Quarter of 2020\nForm 10-Q, or Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible,\nCitigroup discloses the\nmatter. In addition, for such\nmatters, Citigroup discloses\nan estimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters as to which an\nestimate can be made. At\nSeptember 30, 2020,\nCitigroup\u2019s estimate of the\nreasonably possible unaccrued\nloss for these matters was\napproximately $ 1.3billion in\nthe aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is\nable to estimate will change,\nand the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition,\nwhile many estimates presented\nin financial statements and\nother financial disclosures\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of\nreasonably possible loss\narising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nhave only preliminary,\nincomplete, or inaccurate\ninformation about the facts\nunderlying the claim; its\nassumptions about the future\nrulings of the court or other\ntribunal on significant\nissues, or the behavior and\nincentives of adverse parties,\nregulators, or tax authorities\nmay prove to be wrong; and the\noutcomes it is attempting to\npredict are often not amenable\nto the use of statistical or\nother quantitative analytical\ntools. In addition, from time\nto time an outcome may occur\nthat Citigroup had not\naccounted for in its estimates\nbecause it had deemed such an\noutcome to be remote. For all\nthese reasons, the amount of\nloss in excess of accruals\nultimately incurred for the\nmatters as to which an\nestimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the range of loss\nincluded in the estimate.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current legal\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters\ndescribed in this Note would\nnot be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters\ncould, from time to time, have\na material adverse effect on\nCitigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash\nflows in particular quarterly\nor annual periods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nForeign Exchange Matters\nAntitrust and Other Litigation\n: On July 28, 2020, in ALLIANZ\nGLOBAL INVESTORS, ET AL. v.\nBANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION,\nET AL., plaintiffs filed a\nthird amended complaint.

announced, on\nMarch 15, 2020, Citi joined\nother major U.S. banks in\nsuspending stock repurchases\nin light of the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, based\non measures announced by the\nFederal Reserve Board in\nSeptember 2020, stock\nrepurchases are prohibited\nthrough the end of the fourth\nquarter of 2020. This\nlimitation on capital\ndistributions may be extended\nby the Federal Reserve Board.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cCapital Resources\u2014Capital\nPlan Resubmission and Related\nLimitations on Capital\nDistributions\u201d above.\nAccordingly, Citi did not have\nany stock repurchases in the\nthird quarter of 2020, other\nthan permitted repurchases\nrelating to issuances of\ncommon stock related to\nemployee stock ownership\nplans. During the quarter,\npursuant to Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors\u2019 authorization, Citi\nrepurchased 24,227 shares (at\nan average price of $43.52) of\ncommon stock, added to\ntreasury stock, related to\nactivity on employee stock\nprograms where shares were\nwithheld to satisfy the\nemployee tax requirements.\n                                                                \n  Dividends                                                     \n                                                                \nConsistent with the regulatory\ncapital framework, Citi\ndeclared common dividends of\n$0.51 per share for the fourth\nquarter of 2020 on October 22,\n2020, and intends to maintain\nits planned capital actions,\nwhich include common dividends\nof $0.51 per share over the\nfour-quarter window of fourth\nquarter of 2020 to third\nquarter of 2021 (the 2020 CCAR\ncycle), subject to approval of\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors and\nthe latest financial and\nmacroeconomic conditions. For\ninformation on Citi\u2019s SCB, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Stress\nCapital Buffer\u201d above.\n\nIn addition to Board of\nDirectors\u2019 approval, Citi\u2019s\nability to pay common stock\ndividends substantially\ndepends on the results of the\nCCAR process required by the\nFederal Reserve Board and the\nsupervisory stress tests\nrequired under the Dodd-Frank\nAct. In June 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board determined that\nchanges in financial markets\nand macroeconomic outlooks\nrelated to the COVID-19\npandemic could have a material\neffect on the risk profile and\nfinancial condition of each\nfirm subject to its capital\nplan rule and, therefore,\nrequired updated capital\nplans. Citigroup resubmitted\nits capital plan on November\n2, 2020.\n\nThrough the end of the fourth\nquarter of 2020, dividends\ncontinue to be capped and tied\nto a formula based on recent\nincome. These limitations on\ncapital distributions may be\nextended by the FRB. Citi\u2019s\ncommon dividends of $0.51 per\nshare during the fourth\nquarter of 2020 are not\nimpacted by the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s temporary\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions. For additional\ninformation on these capital\ndistribution limitations, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Capital\nPlan Resubmission and Related\nLimitations on Capital\nDistributions\u201d above.\n\nAny dividend on Citi\u2019s\noutstanding common stock would\nalso need to be made in\ncompliance with Citi\u2019s\nobligations on its outstanding\npreferred stock.\n\nFor information on the ability\nof Citigroup\u2019s subsidiary\ndepository institutions to pay\ndividends, see Note 18 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                              224                               \n                                                                \n                           SIGNATURES                           \n                                                                \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on\nits behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, on the\n4th day of November, 2020.\n                                                                \n                         CITIGROUP INC.                         \n                                                                \n                          (Registrant)                          \nBy /s/ Mark A.
