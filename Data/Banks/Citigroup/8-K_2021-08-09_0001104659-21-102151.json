The business, which is part of Citi\u2019sGlobal\nConsumer Bankingsegment, had approximately $9.0 billion of\nassets including $8.9 billion of loans (net of allowance), and\n$6.8 billion of deposits as of June 30, 2021. The sale, which is\nsubject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, is\nexpected to occur in the first half of 2022. In the third\nquarter of 2021, the business will be reported as held-for-sale\n(HFS). As a result, Citi\u2019s third quarter 2021 financial results\nwill include an approximate pretax loss on sale of $670 million\n($580 million after-tax), with both amounts subject to closing\nadjustments. The loss on sale primarily reflects the impact of a\npretax $610 million currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss\n(net of hedges) already reflected in the Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (AOCI) component of equity. Upon closing,\nthe CTA-related balance would be removed from the AOCI component\nof equity, resulting in a neutral impact from CTA to Citi\u2019s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital. Ultimately, the sale is expected\nto result in an improvement in Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio due to the reduction in associated risk weighted\nassets.\n\nCertain statements in this current report on Form 8-K are\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the rules and\nregulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC).

These factors also\nconsist of those contained in Citi\u2019s filings with the SEC,\nincluding without limitation the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of\nCiti\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K.
