Current Report on Form 8-K Item 7.01 Regulation\nFD Disclosure. On June 23, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board\ncommunicated that Citigroup Inc.\u2019s (Citi) Stress Capital Buffer\n(SCB) requirement would increase from the currently effective\nrequirement of 3.0% to 4.0% for the four-quarter window of 4Q\n2022 to 3Q 2023. Accordingly, effective October 1, 2022, Citi is\nrequired to maintain an 11.5% effective minimum Common Equity\nTier 1 (CET 1) Capital ratio under the Standardized Approach,\nincorporating this SCB and its current GSIB surcharge of 3.0%.\nCiti\u2019s effective minimum CET 1 Capital ratio under the Advanced\nApproaches (using the fixed 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer)\nwill remain unchanged at 10%. Commencing January 1, 2023, Citi\u2019s\nGSIB surcharge will increase from 3.0% to 3.5%, which will be\napplicable to both the Standardized Approach and the Advanced\nApproaches, resulting in a minimum CET 1 regulatory requirement\nof 12% under the Standardized Approach and 10.5% under the\nAdvanced Approaches, both as of such date. As of March 31, 2022,\nCiti\u2019s CET 1 Capital ratio was 11.4% under both the Standardized\nand Advanced Approaches. Citi plans to maintain the current\ncommon dividend of $0.51 per share in the third quarter of 2022.\nCiti\u2019s quarterly common dividend is subject to approval by\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors and the latest financial and\nmacroeconomic conditions.
