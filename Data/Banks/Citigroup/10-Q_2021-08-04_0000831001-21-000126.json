Year-to-date,\nCiti returned nearly $7\nbillion of capital to its\ncommon shareholders, the\nmaximum amount permitted under\nFederal Reserve Board rules.\n\n\u2022 During the quarter, the\nFederal Reserve Board\ncommunicated that Citi\u2019s\nStress Capital Buffer (SCB)\nrequirement would be 3.0% for\nthe four-quarter window of\nfourth quarter of 2021 to\nthird quarter of 2022 (the\n2021 CCAR cycle). For\ninformation on Citi\u2019s SCB, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Stress\nCapital Buffer\u201d below.\n\nFor a discussion of trends,\nuncertainties and risks that\nwill or could impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition during the remainder\nof 2021, see this Executive\nSummary, each respective\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations and \u201cForward-\nLooking Statements\u201d below, and\n\u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Overview,\u201d\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Second Quarter of 2021 Results Summary                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $6.2 billion, or $2.85 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $1.1 billion, or $0.38 per\nshare, in the prior-year\nperiod. The increase in net\nincome was driven by lower\ncost of credit, partially\noffset by lower revenues and\nhigher expenses. Citigroup\u2019s\neffective tax rate was 16% in\nthe current quarter compared\nto 5% in the second quarter of\n2020. The current quarter tax\nrate reflects certain tax\nbenefit items related to\nnon-U.S. operations. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s tax rate, see \u201cIncome\nTaxes\u201d below. Earnings per\nshare also increased\nsignificantly, reflecting the\nincrease in net income, as\nwell as a slight decline in\naverage diluted shares\noutstanding.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $17.5\nbillion in the second quarter\nof 2021 decreased 12% from the\nprior-year period, primarily\nreflecting lower revenues in\nboth GCB and ICG .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans decreased 1% to $677\nbillion. Excluding the impact\nof foreign currency\ntranslation\n\ninto U.S. dollars for\nreporting purposes (FX\ntranslation), Citigroup\u2019s end-\nof-period loans decreased 3%,\nreflecting a higher level of\nrepayments in both GCB and ICG\n. Citigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits increased 6% to $1.3\ntrillion. Excluding the impact\nof FX translation, Citigroup\u2019s\nend-of-period deposits\nincreased 4%, primarily driven\nby growth in both GCB and ICG\n, reflecting consistent client\nengagement and elevated levels\nof liquidity in the financial\nsystem. (Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition excluding the impact\nof FX translation are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.)\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup operating expenses\nof $11.2 billion increased 7%\nfrom the prior-year period.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, expenses\nincreased 4%, reflecting a\nnormalization relative to a\nlow comparison in the prior-\nyear period related to the\npandemic, along with continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, as well as\nother strategic investments,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nAs previously announced, Citi\ncontinues to expect to incur\nhigher expenses in 2021\ncompared to 2020, as it\naccelerates certain strategic\ninvestments and continues to\ninvest in its transformation\nas noted above.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a benefit of\n$1.1 billion, compared to a\ncost of $8.2 billion in the\nprior-year period, driven by\nnet ACL reserve releases of\n$2.4 billion across ICG , GCB\nand Corporate/Other . Citi\u2019s\nnet ACL release primarily\nreflected improvements in\nportfolio quality, as well as\nthe continued improvement in\nCiti\u2019s macroeconomic outlook.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u2014Citi\u2019s\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n(ACL)\u201d below.\n                               3                                \nNet credit losses of $1.3\nbillion decreased 39% from the\nprior-year period. Consumer\nnet credit losses of $1.2\nbillion decreased 33%,\nprimarily reflecting lower\nloan volumes and improved\ndelinquencies in the North\nAmerica cards portfolios.\nCorporate net credit losses\ndecreased to $89 million from\n$324 million in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by improvements\nin overall portfolio credit\nquality.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) Capital ratio was\n11.8% as of June 30, 2021,\nbased on the Basel III\nStandardized Approaches for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets, compared to 11.5% as\nof June 30, 2020, based on the\nBasel III Advanced Approaches\nframework for determining\nrisk-weighted assets. The\nincrease in the ratio\nreflected net income,\npartially offset by the return\nof capital to common\nshareholders and an increase\nin risk-weighted assets.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of June 30,\n2021 was 5.8%, compared to\n6.6% as of June 30, 2020. The\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby the expiration of a\ntemporary relief granted by\nthe Federal Reserve Board. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s capital ratios, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Global Consumer Banking                                       \n                                                                \nGCB net income of $1.8 billion\ncompared to a net loss of $703\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, reflecting lower cost\nof credit, partially offset by\nlower revenues and higher\nexpenses. GCB operating\nexpenses of $4.6 billion\nincreased 10% from the prior-\nyear period. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nexpenses increased 7%,\nreflecting continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, as well as\nother strategic investments,\nan acceleration in marketing\nand higher volume-related\ncosts, partially offset by\nefficiency savings.\n\nGCB revenues of $6.8 billion\ndecreased 7%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues decreased 10%, as\ncontinued strong deposit\ngrowth and momentum in\ninvestment management were\nmore than offset by lower\naverage card loans and lower\ndeposit spreads across all\nthree regions.\n\nNorth America GCB revenues of\n$4.2 billion decreased 11%,\nwith lower revenues across\nCiti-branded cards, Citi\nretail services and retail\nbanking. Citi-branded cards\nrevenues of $2.0 billion\ndecreased 12%, reflecting\nlower average loans. Citi\nretail services revenues of\n$1.2 billion decreased 14%,\nprimarily driven by lower\naverage loans. Retail banking\nrevenues of $1.0 billion\ndecreased 7%, as the benefit\nof stronger deposit volumes\nwas more than offset by lower\ndeposit spreads, as well as\nlower mortgage revenues.\n\nYear-over-year, North America\nGCB average deposits of $204\nbillion increased 18%, assets\nunder management of $85\nbillion increased 23% and\naverage retail banking loans\nof $50 billion decreased 4%.\nAverage Citi-branded card\nloans of $79 billion decreased\n4%, while average Citi retail\nservices loans of $42 billion\ndecreased 8%, both reflecting\nhigher payment rates. Citi-\nbranded card purchase sales of\n$104 billion increased 40% and\nCiti retail services purchase\nsales of $24 billion also\nincreased 40%, reflecting a\ncontinued recovery in\n\nsales activity from the low\nlevels in the prior-year\nperiod related to the\npandemic.

Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\ninternational GCB revenues\ndeclined 6%, largely\nreflecting the continued\nimpact of the pandemic. On\nthis basis, Latin America GCB\nrevenues declined 11%, driven\nby lower loan volumes and\nlower deposit spreads,\npartially offset by growth in\nassets under management. Asia\nGCB revenues decreased 3%, as\nstrong investment revenues\nwere more than offset by lower\ndeposit spreads.

Excluding the impact\nof FX translation, expenses\nincreased 2%, primarily driven\nby continued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation, along\nwith other strategic\ninvestments, partially offset\nby lower incentive\ncompensation and efficiency\nsavings.\n\nICG revenues of $10.4 billion\ndecreased 14%, primarily\nreflecting a 30% decline in\nMarkets and securities\nservices revenues, partially\noffset by a 6% increase in\nBanking revenues. The increase\nin Banking revenues included\nthe impact of $37 million of\nlosses on loan hedges related\nto corporate lending, compared\nto aggregate losses of $431\nmillion related to corporate\nlending ($414 million) and the\nprivate bank ($17 million) in\nthe prior-year period.\n\nExcluding the impact of gains\n(losses) on loan hedges,\nBanking revenues of $5.6\nbillion decreased 1%, as\nhigher revenues in the private\nbank and investment banking\nwere more than offset by lower\nrevenues in corporate lending\nand treasury and trade\nsolutions. Investment banking\nrevenues of $1.8 billion\nincreased 1%, primarily\nreflecting revenue growth in\nadvisory and equity\nunderwriting, largely offset\nby lower revenues in debt\nunderwriting.

Corporate\nlending revenues of $511\nmillion increased from $232\nmillion. Excluding the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges, corporate lending\nrevenues of $548 million\ndecreased 15%, primarily due\nto lower loan volumes.\n\nMarkets and securities\nservices revenues of $4.8\nbillion decreased 30%. Fixed\nincome markets revenues of\n$3.2 billion decreased 43%\nversus a strong prior-year\nperiod in both rates and\nspread products. Equity\nmarkets revenues of $1.1\nbillion increased 37%, driven\nby strong performance in\nderivatives and prime finance,\nreflecting solid client\nactivity and favorable market\nconditions. Securities\nservices revenues of $672\nmillion increased 9%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, securities\nservices revenues increased\n5%, primarily reflecting\ngrowth in fee revenues, driven\nby growth in assets under\ncustody and settlement\nvolumes, partially offset by\nlower deposit spreads.

Operating\nexpenses of $378 million\nincreased 14%, primarily\ndriven by the impact of\nforeign exchange translation.\n\nCorporate/Other revenues of\n$267 million declined from\n$290 million in the prior-year\nperiod, as positive marks on\ninvestments were more than\noffset by the absence of AFS\ngains.

costs from a \u201cchange in accounting\nestimate effected by a change in accounting principle\u201d to a\n\u201cchange in accounting principle,\u201d which required an adjustment\nto January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020\nnet income. As a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and quarterly results\nfor 2020 were revised to reflect this change as if it were\neffective as of January 1, 2020, as follows: an increase to\nbeginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $330 million\nand a decrease of $443 million in the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans, as well as a $113 million decrease in other\nassets related to income taxes; a decrease of $18 million to\nprovisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and\nincreases of $339 million and $122 million to provisions for\ncredit losses on loans in the second and third quarters,\nrespectively; and increases in operating expenses of $49 million\nand $45 million with a corresponding decrease in net credit\nlosses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. See Note\n1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation.\n\n(2) Certain series of preferred stock have semiannual payment\ndates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n(3) The return on average common stockholders\u2019 equity is\ncalculated using net income less preferred stock dividends\ndivided by average common stockholders\u2019 equity. The return on\naverage total Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity is calculated using\nnet income divided by average Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(4) RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. For\ninformation on RoTCE and TBV, see \u201cCapital Resources\u2014Tangible\nCommon Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per\nShare and Return on Equity\u201d below.\n\n(5) Citi\u2019s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1\nCapital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized\nApproach framework as of June 30, 2021, and under the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches framework as of June 30, 2020, whereas\nCiti\u2019s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under the\nBasel III Advanced Approaches framework for both periods\npresented.\n\n(6) Dividend payout ratio is calculated as dividends declared\nper common share as a percentage of net income per diluted\nshare.\n\n(7) Total payout ratio is calculated as total common dividends\ndeclared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net\nincome available to common shareholders ( Net income less\npreferred dividends).

The decline in retail\nbanking revenues was also\nimpacted by a 5% decrease in\nretail lending revenues,\nreflecting a decline in\npersonal loans and mortgages\ndriven by spread compression.\n\nCards revenues were largely\nunchanged, as lower average\nloans (down 6%, largely\nreflecting higher payment\nrates) were offset by higher\nspending-related revenues\n(purchase sales up 23%),\nreflecting a continued\nrecovery in sales activity\nfrom the pandemic-driven low\nlevels in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nExpenses increased 8%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, as well as\nother strategic investments,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nProvisions decreased 73%,\nprimarily driven by a net ACL\nrelease compared to a net ACL\nbuild in the prior-year\nperiod, as well as lower net\ncredit losses.

includes\nboth accrual loans and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on\nloan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives\nand the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at\nfair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted\nagainst the private bank and corporate lending revenues to\nreflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on loan\nhedges include $(37) million and $(109) million related to the\ncorporate loan portfolio and $0 million and $(9) million related\nto the private bank for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2021. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include $(414) million and\n$340 million related to the corporate loan portfolio and $(17)\nmillion and $45 million related to the private bank for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively.\nCitigroup\u2019s results of operations excluding the impact of gains\n(losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n(2) Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses\nother than Markets , primarily treasury and trade solutions and\nthe private bank.\n\n(3) Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total\nrevenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items.\nFor example, securities that generate Net interest revenue may\nbe risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue.

Markets\nand securities services\nrevenues were down 30%,\nprimarily reflecting a\nnormalization in fixed income\nrevenues, partially offset by\ngrowth in equity markets and\nsecurities services.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nincreased 1%, as higher\nrevenues in both advisory and\nequity underwriting were\nlargely offset by lower debt\nunderwriting revenues.\nAdvisory revenues increased\n77%, reflecting strength in\nNorth America and EMEA , with\noverall growth in the market\nwallet as well as wallet share\ngains. Equity underwriting\nrevenues increased 11%,\nprimarily driven by solid\nperformance in EMEA ,\npartially offset by North\nAmerica , largely reflecting\ngrowth in the market wallet.\nDebt underwriting revenues\ndecreased 21%, primarily\nreflecting a decline in North\nAmerica , largely driven by a\ndecline in wallet share, as\nactivity was primarily\nconcentrated in non-\ninvestment-grade underwriting,\nwhile Citi skews toward\ninvestment-grade underwriting,\nas well as a strong prior-year\ncomparison, particularly in\ninvestment-grade underwriting.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 1%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, revenues declined\n2%, reflecting a decline in\nthe cash business, partially\noffset by an increase in\ntrade. Cash revenues\ndecreased, as strong growth in\nfee revenues reflecting solid\nclient\n\nengagement and growth in\ntransaction volumes, including\n\nthe early signs of recovery in\ncommercial cards from the low\nlevels in the prior-year\nperiod due to the pandemic,\nwas more than offset by the\nimpact of lower interest\nrates. In trade, revenues\nincreased across North America\n, EMEA and Asia , primarily\nreflecting improved loan\nspreads. End-of-period trade\nloans grew 6% (4% excluding\nthe\n\nimpact of FX translation),\nreflecting increasing client\ndemand and improving\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nwere $511 million versus $232\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, including the impact\nof losses on loan hedges.\nExcluding the impact of losses\non loan hedges, revenues\ndecreased 15%, primarily\ndriven by lower loan volumes,\nreflecting continued weakness\nin demand given stronger\nclient liquidity positions as\nwell as higher repayment\nrates.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 6%. Excluding the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges, revenues increased 4%,\nprimarily reflecting strength\nin North America and EMEA .\nThe increase in revenues was\ndriven by higher fees,\nincluding higher managed\ninvestments revenue and higher\nlending volumes and spreads,\nreflecting solid client\nengagement, partially offset\nby lower deposit spreads and\nlower capital markets\nrevenues.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues decreased 43%, with\ndeclines across all regions,\nreflecting a comparison to a\nstrong prior-year period in\nrates and spread products and\na normalization in market\nactivity. Non-interest\nrevenues decreased, reflecting\na normalization in activity\nand volatility across rates\nand currencies and spreads\nproducts. Net interest\nrevenues also decreased,\nlargely reflecting a change in\nthe mix of trading positions.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\ndecreased 44%, driven by the\nnormalization in market\nactivity and a comparison to a\nstrong prior-year period that\nincluded elevated levels of\nvolatility related to the\npandemic.\n\nSpread products and other\nfixed income revenues\ndecreased 39%, driven by a\ncomparison to a strong prior-\nyear period in flow trading\nand commodities, reflecting\nthe normalization in activity,\nincluding lower volatility.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 37%, reflecting\nstrength in equity derivatives\nand prime finance, partially\noffset by a modest decline in\ncash equities. Equity\nderivatives revenues\nincreased, reflecting a\nfavorable year-over-year\ncomparison as well as an\nincrease in client activity in\nstructured products,\nparticularly in North America\nand EMEA . Prime finance\nrevenues increased, primarily\ndriven by favorable market\nconditions, increased dividend\nactivity compared to the\nprior-year period and growth\nin client balances.

Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues increased 5%, as an\nincrease in fee revenues,\ndriven by growth in assets\nunder custody and settlement\nvolumes, was partially offset\nby a decline in deposit\nspreads due to the continued\nlow interest rate environment.\n\nExpenses were up 4%. Excluding\nthe impact of FX translation,\nexpenses increased 2%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, along with\nstrategic investments,\npartially offset by lower\nincentive compensation and\nefficiency savings.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $810 million compared to\ncosts of $3.9 billion in the\nprior-year period, driven by\nan ACL release and lower net\ncredit losses. Net credit\nlosses declined to $89 million\nfrom $324 million in the\nprior-year period, driven by\nimprovements in overall\nportfolio quality.\n\nThe ACL release for the\nquarter was $0.9 billion,\ncompared to a build of $3.5\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod.

The effective\nminimum requirements are\napplicable through September\n30, 2021. See \u201cStress Capital\nBuffer\u201d above for additional\ninformation.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply\nthe modified transition\nprovision related to the\nimpact of the CECL accounting\nstandard on regulatory\ncapital, as provided by the\nU.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule.\nUnder the modified CECL\ntransition provision, the\nchanges in retained earnings\n(after-tax), deferred tax\nassets (DTAs) arising from\ntemporary differences and the\nallowance for credit losses\nupon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date have been\ndeferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per\nyear commencing January 1,\n2022. For the ongoing impact\nof CECL, Citigroup is allowed\nto adjust retained earnings\nand the allowance for credit\nlosses in an amount equal to\n25% of the change in the\nallowance for credit losses\n(pretax) for each period\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The\ncumulative adjustments to\nretained earnings and the\nallowance for credit losses\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital\nat 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related\nto the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding\nadjustments to average on-\nbalance sheet assets are\nreflected in quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nand Total Leverage Exposure.\nIn addition, the increase in\nDTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences upon the January\n1, 2020 adoption date has been\ndeducted from risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and will phase in\nto RWA at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022.\n\n(3) Citi\u2019s reportable Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital and Tier\n1 Capital ratios were derived\nunder the Basel III\nStandardized Approach as of\nJune 30, 2021, and under the\nBasel III Advanced Approaches\nframework as of March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, whereas\nCiti\u2019s reportable Total\nCapital ratio was derived\nunder the Basel III Advanced\nApproaches framework for all\nperiods presented.\n\n(4) Tier 1 Leverage ratio\ndenominator.

Commencing\nwith the second quarter of\n2020 and continuing through\nthe first quarter of 2021,\nCitigroup\u2019s Total Leverage\nExposure temporarily excluded\nU.S. Treasuries and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks. The\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nas of the second quarter of\n2021 declined approximately\n100 basis points as a result\nof the expiration of the\ntemporary relief.

such\npreferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board\nregulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under\nU.S. GAAP.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision\nrelated to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on\nregulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the\nallowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the\nongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained\nearnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal\nto 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax)\nfor each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021.\nThe cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the\nallowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December\n31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per\nyear commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts\nrelated to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.\n\n(3) Includes goodwill \u201cembedded\u201d in the valuation of significant\ncommon stock investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions.\n           Footnotes continue on the following page.            \n                                                                \n                               25                               \n(4) Of Citi\u2019s $24.5 billion of net DTAs at June 30, 2021, $15.1\nbillion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant\nto the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.4 billion was excluded.\nExcluded from Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of June 30,\n2021 was $11.2 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating\nloss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-\nforwards. The amount excluded was reduced by $1.8 billion of net\nDTLs primarily associated with goodwill and certain other\nintangible assets that are separately deducted from capital.\nDTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely\ndeducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required\nto be deducted from capital only if these DTAs exceed 10%/15%\nlimitations under the U.S. Basel III rules. Citi\u2019s DTAs do not\ncurrently exceed these limitations and, therefore, are not\nsubject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are\nsubject to risk weighting at 250%.\n\n(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the\nVolcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting\ncertain proprietary investment activities and limits their\nownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Commencing\nJanuary 1, 2021, Citi no longer deducts permitted market making\npositions in third-party covered funds from Tier 1 Capital, in\naccordance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0 issued by the U.S.\nagencies in November 2019. Upon the removal of the capital\ndeduction, permitted market making positions in third-party\ncovered funds are included in risk-weighted assets.\n\n(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the\nU.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased out of Tier 2\nCapital by January 1, 2022.\n\n(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit\nlosses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25%\nof credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for\ncredit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted\nassets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in\nwhich eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit\nlosses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the\nextent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit\nreserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible\nfor inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under\nthe Advanced Approaches framework was $5.2 billion and $5.1\nbillion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n                               26                               \n

Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax),\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences\nand the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020\nCECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\nFor the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank is allowed to adjust\nretained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an\namount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit\nlosses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained\nearnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance\nsheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total\nassets and Total Leverage Exposure. In addition, the increase in\nDTAs arising from temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020\nadoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA)\nand will phase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1,\n2022.\n\n(3) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach in which the ACL is\neligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted in\narriving at credit risk-weighted assets.\n\n(4) Citibank\u2019s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches framework, whereas Citibank\u2019s\nreportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital\nratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized\nApproach for all periods presented.\n\n(5) Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of\n6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nregulations applicable to insured depository institutions as\nestablished by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also\nmaintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\n\n(6) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly\naverage total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n\n(7) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Citibank did not\nelect to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks from Total Leverage Exposure.

Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly, and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. This includes but\nis not limited to exposures in\nthose sectors significantly\nimpacted by the pandemic\n(including consumer retail,\ncommercial real estate and\ntransportation). Citigroup\nbelieves the corporate credit\nportfolio to be appropriately\nrated and classified as of\nJune 30, 2021. Since the onset\nof the COVID-19 pandemic,\nCitigroup has taken action to\nadjust internal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition,\n                               44                               \ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other risk\nmitigants to hedge the\nincremental credit risk, or\nmay result in Citi\u2019s seeking\nto reduce exposure to an\nobligor or an industry sector.\nCiti will continue to review\nexposures to ensure that the\nappropriate probability of\ndefault is incorporated into\nall risk assessments.

As of June 30,\n2021, Citigroup had\napproximately $972 billion of\navailable liquidity resources\nto support client and business\nneeds, including end-of-period\nHQLA assets; additional\nunencumbered securities,\nincluding excess liquidity\nheld at bank entities that is\nnon-transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup; and\navailable assets not already\naccounted for within Citi\u2019s\nHQLA to support Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and Federal\nReserve Bank discount window\nborrowing capacity.\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR.

In\ngeneral, a bank\u2019s available\nstable funding will include\nportions of equity, deposits\nand long-term debt, while its\nrequired stable funding will\nbe based on the liquidity\ncharacteristics of its assets,\nderivatives and commitments.\nThe ratio of available stable\nfunding to required stable\nfunding will be required to be\ngreater than 100%. The final\nrule became effective\nbeginning July 1, 2021, while\npublic disclosure requirements\nto report the ratio will occur\non a semiannual basis\nbeginning June 30, 2023. Citi\nwas in compliance with the\nfinal rule as of its effective\ndate.

Excluding\nthe impact of FX translation,\naverage deposits in ICG grew\n2% year-over-year, with strong\ngrowth in the private bank and\nsecurities services, partly\noffset by a reduction in TTS.\n                               58                               \nLong-Term Debt The weighted-\naverage maturity of unsecured\nlong-term debt issued by\nCitigroup and its affiliates\n(including Citibank) with a\nremaining life greater than\none year was approximately 8.8\nyears as of June 30, 2021,\ncompared to 8.7 years as of\nthe prior year and 8.9 years\nas of the prior quarter. The\nweighted-average maturity is\ncalculated based on the\ncontractual maturity of each\nsecurity. For securities that\nare redeemable prior to\nmaturity at the option of the\nholder, the weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the earliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable. Citi\u2019s\nlong-term debt outstanding at\nthe Citigroup parent company\nincludes benchmark senior and\nsubordinated debt and what\nCiti refers to as customer-\nrelated debt, consisting of\nstructured notes, such as\nequity- and credit-linked\nnotes, as well as non-\nstructured notes. Citi\u2019s\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt is generally driven by\ncustomer demand and\ncomplements benchmark debt\nissuance as a source of\nfunding for Citi\u2019s non-bank\nentities. Citi\u2019s long-term\ndebt at the bank includes bank\nnotes, FHLB advances and\nsecuritizations.\n\nLong-Term Debt Outstanding The\nfollowing table sets forth\nCiti\u2019s end-of-period total\nlong-term debt outstanding for\neach of the dates indicated:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  billions                                                      \n  of                Jun. 30,         Mar. 31,         Jun. 30,  \n  dollars               2021             2021             2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Non-bank\u2026                                                     \n  Benchmark                                                     \n  debt:                                                         \n  Senior       $       127.8    $       120.1    $       126.9  \n  debt                                                          \n  Subordin\u2026             26.2             25.9             27.6  \n  debt                                                          \n  Trust                  1.7              1.7              1.7  \n  preferred                                                     \n  Customer\u2026             73.9             66.2             60.4  \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                6.3              5.9              7.7  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $       235.9    $       219.8    $       224.3  \n  non-bank                                                      \n  Bank                                                          \n  FHLB         $         9.5    $        10.9    $        15.0  \n  borrowin\u2026                                                     \n  Securiti\u2026             11.6             12.8             17.6  \n  Citibank                                                      \n  benchmark              3.7              9.2             16.3  \n  senior                                                        \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                3.9              3.6              6.6  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $        28.7    $        36.5    $        55.5  \n  bank                                                          \n  Total                                                         \n  long-term    $       264.6    $       256.3    $       279.8  \n  debt                                                          \n                                                                \nNote: Amounts represent the\ncurrent value of long-term\ndebt on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet that, for\ncertain debt instruments,\nincludes consideration of fair\nvalue, hedging impacts and\nunamortized discounts and\npremiums.

As of June 30,\n2021, non-bank included $61.5\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries, as\nwell as certain Citigroup\nconsolidated hedging\nactivities. (2) Local country\nand other includes debt issued\nby Citi\u2019s affiliates in\nsupport of their local\noperations. Within non-bank,\ncertain secured financing is\nalso included. (3)\nPredominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Citi-branded credit\ncard receivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\ndecreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by declines\nin unsecured benchmark senior\ndebt, securitizations and FHLB\nborrowings at the bank,\npartially offset by the\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt at the non-bank entities.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding increased, driven\nprimarily by increases in\nunsecured benchmark senior\ndebt and customer-related debt\nat the non-bank entities. As\npart of its liability\nmanagement, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During the\nsecond quarter of 2021, Citi\nredeemed or repurchased an\naggregate of approximately\n$12.3 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               59

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n\nSecured Funding Transactions\n\nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $222\nbillion as of June 30, 2021\nincreased 3% from the prior-\nyear period and 1%\nsequentially. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nsecured funding declined 2%\nfrom the prior-year period and\nincreased 1% sequentially,\nboth driven by normal business\nactivity. The average balance\nfor secured funding was\napproximately $237 billion for\nthe quarter ended June 30,\n2021.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nJune 30, 2021.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $31 billion decreased 22%\nyear-over-year and 2%\nsequentially, primarily driven\nby a decline in FHLB advances\n(see Note 16 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               61                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014 Liquidity Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $1.0 billion,\ncompared to $1.5 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2021. Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfinancing transactions and\nother margin requirements, for\nwhich there are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.5\nbillion, unchanged from March\n31, 2021. Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfunding transactions and other\nmargin requirements, for which\nthere are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of June 30, 2021,\nCiti estimates that a one-\nnotch downgrade of Citigroup\nand Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nresult in increased aggregate\ncash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $1.4 billion,\ncompared to $1.9 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2021 (see also Note\n19 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings at certain Citibank\nsubsidiaries. Mitigating\nactions available to Citibank\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, selling or financing\nhighly liquid government\nsecurities, tailoring levels\nof secured lending, adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nassets, reducing loan\noriginations and renewals,\nraising additional deposits or\nborrowing from the FHLB or\ncentral banks. Citi believes\nthese mitigating actions could\nsubstantially reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above.\n                               62                               \nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. As of June\n30, 2021, Citibank had\nliquidity commitments of\napproximately $9.0 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\ncompared to $10.0 billion as\nof March 31, 2021 (for\nadditional information, see\nNote 18 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients\u2019 adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               63                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk emanates from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(9) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof June 30, 2021.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nThe sequential increase in\nCiti\u2019s net interest revenue\nwas driven by U.S. dollar\nexposure and primarily\nreflected an increase in\ninterest rates. The sequential\nincrease in the estimated\nimpact to AOCI and the Common\nEquity Tier 1 ratio primarily\nreflected changes in the\ncomposition of Citi\u2019s\nTreasury\u2019s investment and\ninterest rate portfolio.\n\nThe relatively small quarterly\nchange in the estimated impact\nto AOCI primarily reflected a\ncontinuation of the\npositioning strategy of Citi\nTreasury\u2019s investment\nsecurities and related\ninterest rate derivatives\nportfolio.\n\nIn the event of a parallel\ninstantaneous 100 bps increase\nin interest rates, as of June\n30, 2021, Citi expects that\nthe $5.0 billion negative\nimpact to AOCI would be offset\nin stockholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio over approximately\n37 months.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under five\ndifferent changes in interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and Citi\u2019s other\ncurrencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d).

This is because\nthe combination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n\nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.7 billion,\nor 1.0%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s foreign\ncurrency translation\nadjustment in AOCI , net of\nhedges. This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nEuro and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency translation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the impact\nof these changes on Citi\u2019s TCE\nand Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

As of March 31, 2021, the add-on was 34%.\n\nAs set forth in the table below, Citi\u2019s average trading VAR\nincreased quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to an increase in\nexposure from interest rate hedges, increased yield curve\npositioning and commodities exposures, all in ICG \u2019s Markets\nbusinesses.

Buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss excludes\nrealized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and\ncommissions, intra-day trading\nprofit and loss and changes in\nreserves. Based on a 99%\nconfidence level, Citi would\nexpect two to three days in\nany one year where buy-and-\nhold losses exceed the\nRegulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of\nCiti\u2019s VAR model (as a result\nof taking the greater of\nshort- and long-term\nvolatilities and fat-tail\nscaling of volatilities), Citi\nwould expect fewer exceptions\nunder normal and stable market\nconditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions\ncould increase the number of\nback-testing exceptions. As of\nJune 30, 2021, there were no\nback-testing exceptions\nobserved for Citi\u2019s Regulatory\nVAR for the prior 12 months.\n                               77                               \n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \nFor additional information\nregarding strategic risk,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of\nstrategic risk, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Strategic Risk\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s First Quarter of 2021\nForm 10-Q and Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of June 30, 2021.\n(Including the U.S, the total\nexposure as of June 30, 2021\nto the top 25 countries would\nrepresent approximately 96% of\nCiti\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower.

As of June 30,\n2021, the international NDF\nmarket had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\u2019s\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge nearly all of its\nArgentine peso exposure. As a\nresult, and to the extent that\nCiti does not execute NDF\ncontracts for this unhedged\nexposure in the future, Citi\nwould record devaluations on\nits net Argentine\npeso\u2010denominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate\nallowances for credit losses\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\nsuch risks under U.S. GAAP as\nof June 30, 2021. However,\nU.S. regulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\ncontains a summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCitigroup\u2019s 2020 Annual Report\non Form 10-K). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. The fair value of\nthese instruments is reported\non Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet where the changes in\nfair value are recognized in\neither the Consolidated\nStatement of Income or in AOCI\n.\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nare recognized in earnings.\nWhere Citi does not intend to\nsell the security nor could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nthe portion of the loss\nrelated to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAdjudicating the temporary\nnature of fair value\nimpairments is also inherently\njudgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in this Form 10-Q\nand Note 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2020 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                               80                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below shows Citi\u2019s\nACL as of the second quarter\nof 2021.

In addition,\nCiti reserves for expected\ncredit losses on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables. These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome each reporting period.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses a forward-\nlooking base macroeconomic\nforecast. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects economic\nuncertainty using alternative\ndownside macroeconomic\nscenarios and portfolio\ncharacteristics and current\neconomic conditions not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as adjustments\nto reflect uncertainty around\nthe estimated impact of the\npandemic on credit losses.\nBoth the quantitative and\nqualitative management\nadjustment components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation, and (iv) a\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default (PD),\nloss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD). The\nloss likelihood and severity\nmodels used for estimating\nexpected credit losses are\nsensitive to changes in\nmacroeconomic variables that\ninform the forecasts, and\ncover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates (among\nother things), as well as\nother current economic factors\nand credit trends, including\nhousing prices, unemployment\nand gross domestic product\n(GDP).\n                               81                               \nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes,\namong other things, management\nadjustments to reflect\neconomic uncertainty based on\nthe likelihood and severity of\ndownside scenarios and certain\nportfolio characteristics not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as\nconcentrations, collateral\nvaluation, model limitations,\nidiosyncratic events and other\nfactors as required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent also reflects the\nuncertainty around the\nestimated impact of the\npandemic on credit loss\nestimates. The ultimate extent\nof the pandemic\u2019s impact on\nCiti\u2019s ACL will depend on,\namong other things, (i) how\nconsumers respond to the\nconclusion of government\nstimulus and assistance\nprograms, (ii) the impact on\nunemployment, (iii) the timing\nand extent of the economic\nrecovery, (iv) the severity\nand duration of any resurgence\nof COVID-19, (v) the rate of\ndistribution and\nadministration of vaccines and\n(vi) the extent of any market\nvolatility. 2Q21 Changes in\nthe Allowance In the second\nquarter of 2021, Citi released\n$1.5 billion of the ACL for\nits consumer portfolios and\n$0.9 billion of the ACL for\nits corporate portfolios, for\na total release of $2.4\nbillion. The releases in\nconsumer and corporate ACLs\nwere driven primarily by\nimprovements in portfolio\nquality and macroeconomic\nforecasts. The overall\nqualitative management\nadjustments were largely\nunchanged compared to the\nprevious quarter. Based on its\nlatest macroeconomic forecast,\nCiti believes its analysis of\nthe ACL reflects the forward\nview of the economic analysis\nas of June 30, 2021.\n\nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nconsiders a multitude of\nmacroeconomic variables for\nboth the base and downside\nmacroeconomic forecasts it\nuses to estimate the ACL,\nincluding domestic and\ninternational variables for\nits global portfolios and\nexposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. Real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL.

Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 2Q21, U.S. Real GDP growth\nis expected to remain strong\nin 2021 and 2022 and the\nunemployment rate is expected\nto continue to improve as the\nU.S. moves past the peak of\nthe pandemic-related health\nand economic crisis. Consumer\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACL release\n(including Corporate/Other )\nof $1.5 billion in the second\nquarter of 2021 reduced the\nACL balance to $16.1 billion,\nor 5.84% of total consumer\nloans at June 30, 2021. The\nrelease was primarily driven\nby the improvements in\nportfolio credit quality, as\nwell as the improved\nmacroeconomic forecast. Citi\u2019s\nconsumer ACL is largely driven\nby the cards businesses. For\ncards, including Citi\u2019s\ninternational businesses, the\nlevel of reserves relative to\nEOP loans decreased to 9.72%\nat June 30, 2021, compared to\n10.72% at March 31, 2021,\nprimarily driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality, as well as the\nimproved macroeconomic\nforecast. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to EOP\nloans decreased to 1.5% at\nJune 30, 2021, compared to\n1.8% at March 31, 2021.\n                               82                               \nCorporate\n\nCiti\u2019s corporate ACLL release\nof $0.9 billion in the second\nquarter of 2021 reduced the\nACLL reserve balance to $3.1\nbillion, or 0.80% of total\nfunded loans, and was\nprimarily driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality, as well as the\nimproved macroeconomic\nforecast.\n\nThe Allowance for credit\nlosses on unfunded lending\ncommitments (ACLUC) build of\n$43 million in the second\nquarter of 2021 increased the\ntotal ACLUC reserve balance\nincluded in Other liabilities\nto $2.1 billion at June 30,\n2021.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt June 30, 2021, the ratio of\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses to total funded loans\nwas 2.88% (5.84% for consumer\nloans and 0.80% for corporate\nloans) compared to 3.29% at\nMarch 31, 2021 (6.41% for\nconsumer loans and 1.06% for\ncorporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $4.4 billion at June 30,\n2021, down $708 million from\nMarch 31, 2021. Consumer non-\naccrual loans decreased $178\nmillion to $1.8 billion at\nJune 30, 2021 from $2.0\nbillion at March 31, 2021,\nwhile corporate non-accrual\nloans decreased $530 million\nto $2.6 billion at June 30,\n2021 from $3.1 billion at\nMarch 31, 2021. In addition,\nthe ratio of non-accrual loans\nto total corporate loans was\n0.64%, and 0.65% of non-\naccrual loans to total\nconsumer loans, at June 30,\n2021.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has elected to phase in\nthe CECL impact for regulatory\ncapital purposes. The\ntransition provisions were\nrecently modified to defer the\nphase-in. After two years with\nno impact on capital, the CECL\ntransition impact will phase\nin over a three-year\ntransition period with 25% of\nthe impact (net of deferred\ntaxes) recognized on the first\nday of each subsequent year,\ncommencing January 1, 2022,\nand will be fully implemented\non January 1, 2025. In\naddition, 25% of the build\n(pretax) made in 2020 and 2021\nwill be deferred and amortized\nover the same timeframe.\n\nFor a further description of\nthe ACL and related accounts,\nsee Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor a discussion of the\nadoption of the CECL\naccounting pronouncement, see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually as of July\n1 (the annual test) and\nthrough interim assessments\nbetween annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances\nchange that could more-likely-\nthan-not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its\ncarrying amount, such as a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsignificant decline in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nCiti performed the annual test\nas of July 1, 2020. The fair\nvalues of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units as a\npercentage of their carrying\nvalues ranged from\napproximately 115% to 136%,\nresulting in no impairment.\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, the current\nenvironment continues to\nevolve. Deterioration in\nbusiness performance or\nmacroeconomic and market\nconditions, including\npotential adverse effects to\neconomic forecasts due to the\nseverity and duration of the\npandemic, as well as the\nresponses of governments,\ncustomers and clients, could\nnegatively influence the\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, in particular, the\ndiscount and growth rates used\nin the net income projections.\nIf the future were to differ\nfrom management\u2019s best\nestimate of key economic\nassumptions and associated\ncash flows were to decrease,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture.

Accordingly, the remaining $15.1 billion of net DTAs as of\nJune 30, 2021 was not deducted in calculating regulatory capital\npursuant to Basel III standards and was appropriately risk\nweighted under those rules.\n\nDTA Realizability Citi believes that the realization of the\nrecognized net DTAs of $24.5 billion at June 30, 2021 is more-\nlikely-than-not based on management\u2019s expectations as to future\ntaxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as\nwell as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as\ndefined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ). In the second quarter\nof 2021, as part of the normal planning process, Citi updated\nits forecasts of operating income and foreign source income.\nWith respect to Citi\u2019s general basket for foreign tax credits\n(FTCs), Citi\u2019s revised forecast provided a sufficient level of\nforecasted taxable income to maintain the level of general\nbasket FTCs currently recognized. With respect to non-U.S.\nbranches, Citi\u2019s forecasts evidenced a sufficient level of\nforecasted taxable income to utilize previously unrecognized\nDTAs related to non-U.S. branch FTC carry-forwards in 2021 and\n2022. As a result, the second quarter includes a VA release of\napproximately $450 million related to these FTCs. As part of its\nnormal planning process in the fourth quarter of 2021, Citi\nexpects to further update its forecasts of operating income and\nforeign source income, which in turn could affect Citi\u2019s\nvaluation allowance against FTC carry-forwards. Effective Tax\nRate Citi\u2019s reported effective tax rate for the second quarter\nof 2021 was approximately 16%. This compares to an effective tax\nrate of approximately 5% in the second quarter of 2020. The\neffective tax rate in the current quarter was driven by the $450\nmillion VA release related to non-U.S. branch FTC carry-\nforwards. In the second quarter of 2020, the effective tax rate\nwas driven by the higher relative impact of tax-advantaged\ninvestments and other tax benefits on a relatively low level of\nearnings before taxes.\n                               84                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures.

Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO\nhave concluded that at that\ndate Citigroup\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were\neffective.\n\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION\n219 OF THE IRAN THREAT\nREDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN\nRIGHTS ACT\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the\nIran Threat Reduction and\nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012\n(Section 219), which added\nSection 13(r) to the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, Citi is\nrequired to disclose in its\nannual or quarterly reports,\nas applicable, whether it or\nany of its affiliates\nknowingly engaged in certain\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings relating to Iran or\nwith certain individuals or\nentities that are the subject\nof sanctions under U.S. law.\nDisclosure is generally\nrequired even where the\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings were conducted in\ncompliance with applicable\nlaw. Citi, in its related\nquarterly report on Form 10-Q,\npreviously disclosed no\nreportable activities for the\nfirst quarter of 2021.\n\nDuring the second quarter of\n2021, Citigroup reported 71\ntransactions pursuant to\nSection 219.

In addition, in May\nof 2021, Citigroup\u2019s Russian\nsubsidiary (Citi Russia)\nunblocked and released 69\ntransactions involving\nentities designated pursuant\nto Executive Orders 13382 and\n13224.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of June 30, 2021\nand for the three- and six-\nmonth periods ended June 30,\n2021 and 2020 include the\naccounts of Citigroup Inc. and\nits consolidated subsidiaries.\nIn the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded in Citigroup\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31,\n2020 (2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K) and Citigroup\u2019s\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended March\n31, 2021 (First Quarter of\n2021 Form 10-Q). Certain\nfinancial information that is\nnormally included in annual\nfinancial statements prepared\nin accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP), but is not\nrequired for interim reporting\npurposes, has been condensed\nor omitted. Management must\nmake estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the\nrelated footnote disclosures.\nWhile management uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT\nACCOUNTING POLICIES See Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\na summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting\nfor Financial Instruments \u2014\nCredit Losses Overview In June\n2016, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) issued\nASU No. 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments \u2014 Credit Losses\n(Topic 326). The ASU\nintroduced a new credit loss\nmethodology, the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology, which requires\nearlier recognition of credit\nlosses while also providing\nadditional disclosure about\ncredit risk. Citi adopted the\nASU as of January 1, 2020,\nwhich, as discussed below,\nresulted in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s Allowance for credit\nlosses and a decrease to\nopening Retained earnings ,\nnet of deferred income taxes,\nat January 1, 2020. The CECL\nmethodology utilizes a\nlifetime \u201cexpected credit\nloss\u201d measurement objective\nfor the recognition of credit\nlosses for loans, held-to-\nmaturity debt securities,\nreceivables and other\nfinancial assets measured at\namortized cost at the time the\nfinancial asset is originated\nor acquired. The ACL is\nadjusted each period for\nchanges in expected lifetime\ncredit losses. The CECL\nmethodology represents a\nsignificant change from prior\nU.S. GAAP and replaced the\nprior multiple existing\nimpairment methods, which\ngenerally required that a loss\nbe incurred before it was\nrecognized. Within the life\ncycle of a loan or other\nfinancial asset, the\nmethodology generally results\nin the earlier recognition of\nthe provision for credit\nlosses and the related ACL\nthan prior U.S. GAAP. For\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities where fair value is\nless than cost that Citi\nintends to hold or more-\nlikely-than-not will not be\nrequired to sell, credit-\nrelated impairment, if any, is\nrecognized through an ACL and\nadjusted each period for\nchanges in credit risk.\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL\nTransition (Day 1) Impact The\nCECL methodology\u2019s impact on\nexpected credit losses, among\nother things, reflects Citi\u2019s\nview of the current state of\nthe economy, forecasted\nmacroeconomic conditions and\nquality of Citi\u2019s portfolios.\nAt the January 1, 2020 date of\nadoption, based on forecasts\nof macroeconomic conditions\nand exposures at that time,\nthe aggregate impact to Citi\nwas an approximate $\n4.1billion, or an approximate\n29%, pretax increase in the\nAllowance for credit losses ,\nalong with a $ 3.1billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained\nearnings and a deferred tax\nasset increase of $\n1.0billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $\n4.9billion build to the\nAllowance for credit losses\nfor Citi\u2019s consumer exposures,\nprimarily driven by the impact\non credit card receivables of\nlonger estimated tenors under\nthe CECL lifetime expected\ncredit loss methodology (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n23months) compared to shorter\nestimated tenors under the\nprobable loss methodology\nunder prior U.S. GAAP (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n14months), net of recoveries;\nand (ii) a release of $\n0.8billion of reserves\nprimarily related to Citi\u2019s\ncorporate net loan loss\nexposures, largely due to more\nprecise contractual maturities\nthat result in shorter\nremaining tenors,\nincorporation of recoveries\nand use of more specific\nhistorical loss data based\n                               98                               \non an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and\ngeographies. Under the CECL methodology, the Allowance for\ncredit losses consists of quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Citi\u2019s quantitative component of the Allowance for\ncredit losses is model based and utilizes a single forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast and discounts inputs for the\ncorporate classifiably managed portfolios, complemented by the\nqualitative component described below, in estimating expected\ncredit losses and discounts inputs for the corporate\nclassifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and supportable\nforecast periods vary by product. For example, Citi\u2019s consumer\nmodels use a 13-quarter reasonable and supportable period and\nrevert to historical loss experience thereafter, while its\ncorporate loan models use a nine-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period followed by a three-quarter graduated\ntransition to historical loss experience. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment component includes, among other things,\nmanagement adjustments to reflect economic uncertainty based on\nthe likelihood and severity of downside scenarios and certain\nportfolio characteristics not captured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as concentrations, collateral coverage, model\nlimitations, idiosyncratic events and other factors as required\nby banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment component also includes management\nadjustments to reflect the uncertainty around the estimated\nimpact of the pandemic on credit loss estimates. Accounting for\nVariable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection Costs In the\nfourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the 2020 second quarter\naccounting conclusion for its variable post-charge-off third-\nparty collection costs from a \u201cchange in accounting estimate\neffected by a change in accounting principle\u201d to a \u201cchange in\naccounting principle,\u201d which required an adjustment to January\n1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020 net income.\nAs a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and quarterly results for 2020\nwere revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as\nof January 1, 2020, as follows: \u2022 An increase to beginning\nretained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330million and a\ndecrease of $ 443million in the allowance for credit losses on\nloans, as well as a $ 113million decrease in other assets\nrelated to income taxes. \u2022 A decrease of $ 18million to\nprovisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and\nincreases of $ 339million and $ 122million to provisions for\ncredit losses on loans in the second and third quarters,\nrespectively. \u2022 Increases in operating expenses of $ 49million\nand $ 45million with a corresponding decrease in net credit\nlosses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. In\nmaking these revisions, Citi considered the guidance in ASC\nTopic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ; ASC Topic\n270, Interim Reporting ; ASC Topic 250-S99-1, Assessing\nMateriality ; and ASC Topic 250-S99-23, Accounting Changes Not\nRetroactively Applied Due to Immateriality, Considering the\nEffects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying\nMisstatements in Current Year Financial Statements . Citi\nbelieves that the effects of the revisions were not material to\nany previously reported quarterly or annual period. Reference\nRate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects\nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides\noptional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for\n(or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on\nfinancial reporting. Specifically, the guidance permits an\nentity, when certain criteria are met, to consider amendments to\ncontracts made to comply with reference rate reform to meet the\ndefinition of a modification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows\nhedge accounting to be maintained and permits a one-time\ntransfer or sale of qualifying held-to-maturity securities. The\nexpedients and exceptions provided by the amendments are\npermitted to be adopted any time through December 31, 2022 and\ndo not apply to contract modifications made and hedging\nrelationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022,\nexcept for certain optional expedients elected for certain\nhedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022. The ASU\nwas adopted by Citi as of June 30, 2020 with prospective\napplication and did not impact financial results in 2020. In\nJanuary 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate\nReform (Topic 848): Scope , which clarifies that the scope of\nthe initial accounting relief issued by the FASB in March 2020\nincludes derivative instruments that do not reference a rate\nthat is expected to be discontinued but that use an interest\nrate for margining, discounting or contract price alignment that\nis modified as a result of reference rate reform (commonly\nreferred to as the \u201cdiscounting transition\u201d). The amendments do\nnot apply to contract modifications made after December 31,\n2022, new hedging relationships entered into after December 31,\n2022 and existing hedging relationships evaluated for\neffectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, except for\nhedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that\napply certain optional expedients in which the accounting\neffects are recorded through the end of the hedging\nrelationship. The ASU was adopted by Citi on a full\nretrospective basis upon issuance and did not impact financial\nresults in 2020.\n                               99                               \nFUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES\nLong-Duration Insurance\nContracts In August 2018, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2018-12,\nFinancial Services\u2014Insurance:\nTargeted Improvements to the\nAccounting for Long-Duration\nContracts , which changes the\nexisting recognition,\nmeasurement, presentation and\ndisclosures for long-duration\ncontracts issued by an\ninsurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i)\nimproves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the\nliability for future policy\nbenefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future\ncash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the\naccounting for certain market-\nbased options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or\naccount balance) contracts,\n(iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred\nacquisition costs and (iv)\nintroduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries,\nprimarily in Mexico, that\nissue long-duration insurance\ncontracts such as traditional\nlife insurance policies and\nlife-contingent annuity\ncontracts that will be\nimpacted by the requirements\nof ASU 2018-12.\n\nThe effective date of ASU\n2018-12 was deferred for all\ninsurance entities by ASU\n2019-09, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate (issued in October 2019)\nand by ASU 2020-11, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate and Early Application\n(issued in November 2020).\nCiti plans to adopt the\ntargeted improvements in ASU\n2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and\nis currently evaluating the\nimpact of the standard on its\ninsurance subsidiaries.

These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner-sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other\npartner payments are based on program sales and new account\nacquisitions.\n(2) Includes overdraft fees of $ 24million and $ 20million for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and\n$ 47million and $ 51million for the six months ended June 30,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. Overdraft fees are accounted for\nunder ASC 310.\n(3) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and\nunderwriting loan syndications or related financing activity.\nThis activity is accounted for under ASC 310.\n(4) Commissions and fees includes $( 2,073) million and $(\n1,426) million not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers , for the three months ended June 30,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, and $( 3,822) million and $( 3,228)\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.

For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value, as described in Notes 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The remaining portion is\ncarried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities\nloaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount\ngenerally in excess of the market value of the securities\nloaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities\nborrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or\nposts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection. The following tables present the gross and\nnet resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing\nand lending agreements and the related offsetting amounts\npermitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts\nrelated to financial instruments that are not permitted to be\noffset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting\nto the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal\nopinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has\nbeen obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by\nfinancial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or\nbeen able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of\nthe offsetting right.\n

An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under Citi\u2019s policies. The sections below\ndescribe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected credit\nimpairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of June 30, 2021. Mortgage-\nBacked Securities Citi records no allowances for credit losses\non U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities,\nbecause the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the\nevent of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses\nand due to the nature of the counterparties. State and Municipal\nSecurities The process for estimating credit losses in\nCitigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily based on\na credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings.\nCiti monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing\ndefault protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance.\nThe average external credit rating, ignoring any insurance, is\nAa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other\nindicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-\nspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer\ndefault), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse\nchanges in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is\nrecognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where\nCiti has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an\nallowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects\nnot to collect, capped at the difference between the bond\u2019s\namortized cost basis and fair value. Equity Method Investments\nManagement assesses equity method investments that have fair\nvalues that are less than their respective carrying values for\nother-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured\nas price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly\nlisted securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other\nmethods are used (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). For impaired equity method investments that Citi\nplans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair\nvalue will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether\nthe impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the cause of the impairment and the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,\nincluding any specific events that may influence the operations\nof the issuer; \u2022 the intent and ability to hold the investment\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in market value; and \u2022 the length of time and extent to\nwhich fair value has been less than the carrying value.\n                              122

\nNon-Marketable Equity\nSecurities Not Carried at Fair\nValue Non-marketable equity\nsecurities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.\nImpairment indicators that are\nconsidered include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n\u2022 a significant deterioration\nin the earnings performance,\ncredit rating, asset quality\nor business prospects of the\ninvestee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the\nregulatory, economic or\ntechnological environment of\nthe investee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the general\nmarket condition of either the\ngeographical area or the\nindustry in which the investee\noperates; \u2022 a bona fide offer\nto purchase, an offer by the\ninvestee to sell or a\ncompleted auction process for\nthe same or similar investment\nfor an amount less than the\ncarrying amount of that\ninvestment; and \u2022 factors that\nraise significant concerns\nabout the investee\u2019s ability\nto continue as a going\nconcern, such as negative cash\nflows from operations, working\ncapital deficiencies or\nnoncompliance with statutory\ncapital requirements or debt\ncovenants. When the\nqualitative assessment\nindicates that impairment\nexists, the investment is\nwritten down to fair value,\nwith the full difference\nbetween the fair value of the\ninvestment and its carrying\namount recognized in earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                     June 30, 2021               2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value           $          1,381    $           962  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026          Three                        Six             \n  of              Months                     Months             \n  dollars          Ended                      Ended             \n  Measur\u2026       June 30,                   June 30,             \n  altern\u2026           2021       2020            2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impair\u2026    $         4    $    50    $          4    $    53  \n  losses                                                        \n  Downwa\u2026                                                       \n  changes                                                       \n  for                  \u2014         19               \u2014         19  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n  Upward                                                        \n  changes                                                       \n  for                215         17             296         42  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on these nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                         June 30, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                           73  \n  Downward changes for                                      53  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       783  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

The fair\nvalues of these investments are estimated using the NAV of the\nCompany\u2019s ownership interest in the funds. Some of these\ninvestments are in \u201ccovered funds\u201d for purposes of the Volcker\nRule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment activities\nand limits the ownership of, and relationships with, covered\nfunds.

past due are generally\nclassified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past\ndue when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90\ndays or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest and/or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(4) Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not\nincluded in the various delinquency columns.\n                              138

modifications that meet\nthe TDR relief criteria in the CARES Act or the interagency\nguidance.\n(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal\npayments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of\nperiodic and/or final principal payments. Because forgiveness of\nprincipal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically\nhave little to no impact on the loans\u2019 projected cash flows and\nthus little to no impact on the allowance established for the\nloans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be\nrecorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already\nbeen recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is\nrequired at the time of the modification.\n(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest\npayments may involve a below-market interest rate.\n                              142                               \nThe following table presents total corporate loans modified in a\nTDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the\npayment default occurred within one yearof a permanent\nmodification.

The results of the 2020 annual\nimpairment test resulted in fair values as a percentage of\ncarrying values between 115% and 136%. During the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2021, Citi qualitatively assessed the\ncurrent environment, including the continuing impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, management\u2019s announced strategy to pursue\nexits of its consumer franchises in 13 markets within Asia GCB ,\nobserved changes in market multiples and actual business\nperformance, together with the latest available management\nforecasts. Based on the above, Citi determined it was not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of any reporting unit was\nbelow its book value and there was no indication of impairment\nas of June 30, 2021. While the inherent risk related to\nuncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions used in the\nvaluations, the current environment continues to evolve.\nDeterioration in business performance or macroeconomic and\nmarket conditions, including potential adverse effects to\neconomic forecasts due to the severity and duration of the\npandemic, as well as the responses of governments, customers and\nclients, could negatively influence the assumptions used in the\nvaluations, in particular, the discount and growth rates used in\nnet income projections. If the future were to differ from\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of key economic assumptions, and\nassociated cash flows were to decrease, Citi could potentially\nexperience material goodwill

Citigroup\u2019s June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the\nCompany has any variable interest or continuing involvement\nconsidered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 109billion and $\n78billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 507million and $\n425million in maximum exposure to loss as of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.\n                              157                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $\n59.6billion and $ 57.0billion, respectively (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K); \u2022\ncertain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company\nholds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on\narm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities held by the Company, which are classified as\nTrading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has\nno other involvement with the related securitization entity\ndeemed to be significant (for more information on these\npositions, see Notes 12 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements); \u2022 certain representations and warranties exposures\nin legacy ICG -sponsored mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecuritizations in which the Company has no variable interest or\ncontinuing involvement as servicer. The outstanding balance of\nmortgage loans securitized during 2005 to 2008 in which the\nCompany has no variable interest or continuing involvement as\nservicer was approximately $ 5.0billion and $ 5.2billion at June\n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively; \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have\na variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              158                               \nFunding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated\nVIEs\u2014Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments\nThe following table presents the notional amount of liquidity\nfacilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding\ncommitments in the VIE tables above:\n                                                                \n                  June                    Decemb\u2026               \n                   30,                        31,               \n                  2021                       2020               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  milli\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026  \n  of           facili\u2026       commi\u2026       facili\u2026       commi\u2026  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Non-a\u2026                                                        \n  mortg\u2026    $        \u2014    $       5    $        \u2014    $       2  \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  Asset\u2026             \u2014       10,255             \u2014        9,114  \n  finan\u2026                                                        \n  Munic\u2026                                                        \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  tender                                                        \n  option         1,523            \u2014         1,611            \u2014  \n  bond                                                          \n  trusts                                                        \n  (TOBs)                                                        \n  Munic\u2026             \u2014        3,539             \u2014        3,041  \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  Inves\u2026             \u2014           13             \u2014           15  \n  funds                                                         \n  Other              \u2014            \u2014             \u2014            \u2014  \n  Total                                                         \n  fundi\u2026    $    1,523    $  13,812    $    1,611    $  12,172  \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of                                                \n  dollars                June 30, 2021       December 31, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash                $              \u2014    $                  \u2014  \n  Trading account                  1.4                     2.0  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                      9.6                    10.6  \n  Total loans, net                33.2                    29.3  \n  of allowance                                                  \n  Other                            0.7                     0.3  \n  Total assets        $           44.9    $               42.2  \n                                                                \nCredit Card Securitizations Substantially all of the Company\u2019s\ncredit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Master Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial\nmajority through the Master Trust.

These\nsecurities are backed by\neither residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of\nclients. As of June 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, Citi\nheld noretained interests in\nprivate label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During\nthe three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2021, Citi\ntransferred agency securities\nwith a fair value of\napproximately $ 11.4billion\nand $ 24.5billion,\nrespectively, to re-\nsecuritization entities\ncompared to approximately $\n12billion and $ 19.4billion\nfor the three and six months\nended June 30, 2020,\nrespectively. As of June 30,\n2021, the fair value of Citi-\nretained interests in agency\nre-securitization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.2billion\n(including $ 410million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2021)\ncompared to $ 1.6billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020 (including $\n916million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2020), which is\nrecorded in Trading account\nassets . The original fair\nvalues of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of June 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020 were\napproximately $ 76billion and\n$ 83.6billion, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the Company\ndid not consolidate any\nprivate label or agency re-\nsecuritization entities.\n\nCiti-Administered Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Conduits At\nJune 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, the commercial paper\nconduits administered by Citi\nhad approximately $\n14.6billion and $ 16.7billion\nof purchased assets\noutstanding, respectively, and\nhad incremental funding\ncommitments with clients of\napproximately $ 20billion and\n$ 17.1billion, respectively.\nSubstantially all of the\nfunding of the conduits is in\nthe form of short-term\ncommercial paper. At June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020,\nthe weighted average remaining\nlives of the commercial paper\nissued by the conduits were\napproximately 52and 54days,\nrespectively. The primary\ncredit enhancement provided to\nthe conduit investors is in\nthe form of transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements\ndescribed above. Each asset\npurchased by the conduit is\nstructured with transaction-\nspecific credit enhancement\nfeatures provided by the\nthird-party client seller,\nincluding over-\ncollateralization, cash and\nexcess spread collateral\naccounts, direct recourse or\nthird-party guarantees. These\ncredit enhancements are sized\nwith the objective of\napproximating a credit rating\nof A or above, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. In\naddition to the transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements,\nthe conduits, other than the\ngovernment-guaranteed loan\nconduit, have obtained letters\nof credit from the Company,\nwhich equal at least 8% to 10%\nof the conduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The\nletters of credit provided by\nthe Company to the conduits\ntotal approximately $\n1.3billion and $ 1.5billion as\nof June 30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively. The\nnet result across multi-seller\nconduits administered by the\nCompany is that, in the event\nthat defaulted assets exceed\nthe transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements described\nabove, any losses in each\nconduit are allocated first to\nthe Company and then to the\ncommercial paper investors. At\nJune 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, the Company owned $\n5.6billion and $ 6.6billion,\nrespectively, of the\ncommercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits.

For the remaining exposure related\nto TOB transactions, where the residual owned by the customer\nwas at least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the\ntransaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed. The\nCompany also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of\ncredit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which\nare not variable interest entities, and municipality-related\nissuers that totaled $ 2.5billion and $ 3.6billion as of June\n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nInformation pertaining to\nCitigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from market\nfluctuations (i.e., market\nrisk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or\nperiods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e.,\nliquidity risk), as well as\nany market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n                              166

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              167                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of June\n30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against\ngross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to\nenforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. As a\nresult, the tables reflect a\nreduction of approximately $\n275billion and $ 280billion as\nof June 30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively, of\nderivative assets and\nderivative liabilities that\npreviously would have been\nreported on a gross basis, but\nare now legally settled and\nnot subject to collateral. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              168

For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\nCitigroup has executed a last-\nof-layer hedge, which permits\nan entity to hedge the\ninterest rate risk of a stated\nportion of a closed portfolio\nof prepayable financial assets\nthat are expected to remain\noutstanding for the designated\ntenor of the hedge. In\naccordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment\nrisk when measuring the change\nin fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk under the last-of-\nlayer approach. Similar to\nother fair value hedges, where\nthe hedged item is an asset,\nthe fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk will be presented in\nInterest revenue along with\nthe change in the fair value\nof the hedging instrument.\n\nHedging of Foreign Exchange\nRisk Citigroup hedges the\nchange in fair value\nattributable to foreign\nexchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt\nthat are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the\nentity holding the securities\nor issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nCitigroup considers the\npremium associated with\nforward contracts (i.e., the\ndifferential between the spot\nand contractual forward rates)\nas the cost of hedging; this\namount is excluded from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally\nreflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge.\nCiti also excludes changes in\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the value\nof the hedged inventory is\nreflected in earnings, which\noffsets the change in the fair\nvalue of the futures contract\nthat is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedging instrument recorded in\nearnings includes changes in\nforward rates, Citigroup\nexcludes the differential\nbetween the spot and the\ncontractual forward rates\nunder the futures contract\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, and it is\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in forward rates from\nthe assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income.\n                              171                               \nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the\nCompany\u2019s fair value hedges:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  1    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are\nincluded in Interest income/Interest expense .

For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of June 30, 2021 is\napproximately $ 1billion. The maximum length of time over which\nforecasted cash flows are hedged is 10years. The pretax change\nin AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below. The after-tax\nimpact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is shown in Note 17 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026               \u2026                                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $          \u2026    $          \u2026    $             $           \n                 \u2026               \u2026                              \n      $          \u2026    $          \u2026    $             $           \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n                 \u2026               \u2026                              \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n              $  \u2026            $  \u2026           $             $    \n                                                                \n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate\ncontracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net\ninterest revenue) .

settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020 was\n$ 21billion and $ 25billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 19billion and $\n22billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of June\n30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger\nadditional collateral or cash\nsettlement requirements for\nthe Company and certain\naffiliates. In the event that\nCitigroup and Citibank were\ndowngraded a single notch by\nall threemajor rating agencies\nas of June 30, 2021, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n1.2billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 0.2billion upon the\nsingle notch downgrade,\nresulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$ 1.4billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nboth the asset amounts\nderecognized and the gross\ncash proceeds received as of\nthe date of derecognition were\n$ 3.9billion and $ 2.0billion\nas of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nrespectively. At June 30,\n2021, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 3.9billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of June 30, 2021 was\n$ 62million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n21million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2020, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.2billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 135million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n7million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              176                               \n20.

10-K.\n\nFair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs\nbased on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are developed using market data and reflect\nmarket participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs\nreflect the Company\u2019s market assumptions. These two types of\ninputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level\n1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1\nthat are observable for the asset or liability, either directly\nor indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar\ninstruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar instruments in markets that are not active and model-\nderived valuations in which all significant inputs and\nsignificant value drivers are observable in the market. \u2022 Level\n3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or\nmore significant inputs or significant value drivers are\nunobservable . As required under the fair value hierarchy, the\nCompany considers relevant and observable market inputs in its\nvaluations where possible. The frequency of transactions, the\nsize of the bid/ask spread and the amount of adjustment\nnecessary when comparing similar transactions are all factors in\ndetermining the relevance of observed prices in those markets.\n                              177                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The\nCompany may hedge positions that have been classified in the\nLevel 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging\ninstruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with\nfinancial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2. The\neffects of these hedges are presented gross in the following\ntables:\n\nFair Value Levels\n                                                                \n  In

In other instances, market changes have resulted in\nsome inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable\ninputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the\ninstruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of\nthe money).

The\nelection is made upon the\ninitial recognition of an\neligible financial asset,\nfinancial liability or firm\ncommitment or when certain\nspecified reconsideration\nevents occur. The fair value\nelection may not otherwise be\nrevoked once an election is\nmade.

Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . Among other\nvariables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and\nsimilar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of\nthe Company\u2019s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair\nvalue of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in\nthe Company\u2019s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit\nrisk) were a loss of $ 110million and a loss of $ 2,935million\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and a loss of\n$ 148million and a gain of $ 1,253million for the six months\nended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in fair\nvalue resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk\nwere estimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit\nspreads observable in the bond market into the relevant\nvaluation technique used to value each liability as described\nabove. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial\nLiabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain\nUncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the\nfair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income\nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nborrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-\nterm borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the\nelection was made because the related interest rate risk is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting\nderivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings. Changes in fair value for transactions in\nthese portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The\nrelated interest revenue and interest expense are measured based\non the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are\nreported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans and Other Credit\nProducts Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for\ncertain other originated and purchased loans, including certain\nunfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of\ncredit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses.\nNone of these credit products are highly leveraged financing\ncommitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans\nand unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold\nor securitized in the near term, or transactions where the\neconomic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as\npurchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the\nCompany pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third\nparty. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate\naccounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex\nand to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not\nelected for most lending transactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                                           Decemb\u2026              \n                June 30,                       31,              \n                    2021                      2020              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026        Trading       Loans       Trading       Loans  \n  of              assets                    assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $     8,594    $  7,707    $    8,063    $  6,854  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess            -203        -197          -915         -14  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                \u2014          17             \u2014           4  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                \u2014         -15             \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              197                               \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 763million and $\n1,068million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Changes in\nthe fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are\nclassified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and\n2020 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to losses of\n$ 2million and $ 40million, respectively. Certain Investments in\nUnallocated Precious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated\nprecious metals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium)\nas part of its commodity and foreign currency trading activities\nor to economically hedge certain exposures from issuing\nstructured liabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is\nbifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity forward\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the debt host contract\nwithin Trading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts\nacross unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $\n0.4billion and $ 0.5billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based\non trading activity in future periods. As part of its commodity\nand foreign currency trading activities, Citi trades unallocated\nprecious metals investments and executes forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties.\nWhen Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment,\nCiti\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of June\n30, 2021, there were approximately $ 5.0billion and $ 5.0billion\nof notional amounts of such forward purchase and forward sale\nderivative contracts outstanding, respectively. Certain\nInvestments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures Citigroup\ninvests in private equity and real estate ventures for the\npurpose of earning investment returns and for capital\nappreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for\ncertain of these ventures, because such investments are\nconsidered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

For certain\ncontracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties.

lending indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be $ 111billion and $\n102billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants.\n                              200                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 32million and $ 31million at June\n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and these amounts\nare included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of\nits credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide insurance coverage for rental\ncars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased\nproducts, price protection for certain purchases and protection\nfor lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the\ntable, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nactual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of\nCiti\u2019s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of June 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification\nIn 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary\nof Citi, entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the\nrisks and rewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE\nLife (now Genworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a\nsubsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE). As part of this\ntransaction, the reinsurance obligations were provided by two\nregulated insurance subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two\ncollateral trusts with securities. Presently, as discussed\nbelow, the trusts are referred to as the Genworth Trusts. As\npart of GE\u2019s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks\nand rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance\nagreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth\nthrough GE\u2019s Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC)\nsubsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition,\nGE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC\nthat is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay\nits reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance\nagreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has\nreinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has\nreinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC\npolicies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations\nnow benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While\nneither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the\ncapital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse\nand Citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital\nmaintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will\ncontinue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance\nobligations to Genworth. In connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of\nTravelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an\nindemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder\nclaims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the\nTravelers LTC policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by\nsubsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail\ninsurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers\nLTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original\nreinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and\nGenworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole\nbeneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are\ndesigned to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal\nto the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the\nTravelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are\nevaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair\nvalue of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount\nequal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the\nliabilities change over time. If both (i) Genworth fails to\nperform under the original Travelers/GE Life reinsurance\nagreement for any reason,\n                              201                               \nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the\ntwoGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020 related to this indemnification. However,\nif both events become reasonably possible (meaning more than\nremote but less than probable), Citi will be required to\nestimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of\nloss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In\naddition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required\nto accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable\naccounting principles. Citi continues to closely monitor its\npotential exposure under this indemnification obligation, given\nGE\u2019s 2018 LTC and other charges and the September 2019 AM Best\ncredit ratings downgrade for the Genworth subsidiaries. Futures\nand Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing\nservices on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need\nto clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative\ncontracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and\ncircumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for\naccounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these\nclient transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the\nunderlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. See Note 19 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities that are reflected in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. As a clearing member, Citi\ncollects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin)\nbetween its clients and the respective CCP. In certain\ncircumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or\nsecurities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs.\nThis excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as\nbanks or carry brokers. There are two types of margin: initial\nand variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash\ninitial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial\nmargin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or\ndepository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables\n(payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and\ndue from banks , respectively. However, for exchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared derivative contracts where Citi does not obtain\nbenefits from or control the client cash balances, the client\ncash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the\nCCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi\nhas contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 16.8billion and $ 16.6billion as of June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Variation margin due\nfrom clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients,\nreflects changes in the value of the client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is\nexposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure\nof a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In\nthe event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to\nclose out the client\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically\nutilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP,\nwith any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as\nclearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or\nsecurities margin posted by the client, which would typically be\nexpected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the\nevent the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.3billion and $\n2.2billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 64.6billion and $\n51.6billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 94.1billion and $ 80.1billion at June\n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities\nlending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in\nfavor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 4.5billion and $\n6.6billion at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nOther property may also be available to Citi to cover losses\nunder certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the\nvalue of such property has not been determined.\n                              202                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n

Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At June 30, 2021,\nCitigroup estimates that the\nreasonably possible unaccrued\nloss for these matters ranges\nup to approximately $\n1.4billion in the aggregate.\nAs available information\nchanges, the matters for which\nCitigroup is able to estimate\nwill change, and the estimates\nthemselves will change. In\naddition, while many estimates\npresented in financial\nstatements and other financial\ndisclosures involve\nsignificant judgment and may\nbe subject to significant\nuncertainty, estimates of the\nrange of reasonably possible\nloss arising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of accruals ultimately\nincurred for the matters as to\nwhich an estimate has been\nmade could be substantially\nhigher or lower than the range\nof loss included in the\nestimate. Subject to the\nforegoing, it is the opinion\nof Citigroup\u2019s management,\nbased on current knowledge and\nafter taking into account its\ncurrent accruals, that the\neventual outcome of all\nmatters described in this Note\nwould not be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and\n\nthe inherent unpredictability\nof such matters, an adverse\noutcome in certain of these\nmatters could, from time to\ntime, have a material adverse\neffect on Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated results of\noperations or cash flows in\nparticular quarterly or annual\nperiods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nForeign Exchange Matters\nAntitrust and Other Litigation\n: On May 21, 2021, in ALLIANZ\nGLOBAL INVESTORS GMBH AND\nOTHERS v.
