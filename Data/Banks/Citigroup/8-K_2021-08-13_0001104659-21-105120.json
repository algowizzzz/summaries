(Citi) has begun a Transformation Program across\nthe firm to drive excellence in its risk and control\nenvironment, its operations and its service to clients.\nColleagues at all levels are expected to play an active role in\nachieving these standards, and senior leaders will be\naccountable for driving progress. Citi\u2019s compensation philosophy\nincludes the accountability senior leaders at the firm have \u2013\nindividually and collectively \u2013 to meet the milestones required\nfor a successful Transformation. Lack of sufficient progress\nwill negatively affect the compensation of senior leaders, and\nsenior leaders will have the opportunity to benefit from the\nachievement of Citi\u2019s Transformation goals.\n\nConsistent with this compensation philosophy, on August 13,\n2021, the Personnel and Compensation Committee of Citi\u2019s Board\nof Directors approved a program for Mark Mason, Chief Financial\nOfficer, Paco Ybarra, CEO, Institutional Clients Group, and\nMichael Whitaker, Head of Enterprise Operations and Technology,\nthat provides an opportunity for each to earn additional\ncompensation based on the achievement of Citi\u2019s Transformation\ngoals from August 2021 through December 2024 and satisfaction of\nother conditions. Under this program, Messrs. Mason, Ybarra and\nWhitaker each have the opportunity to earn up to an additional\n$5 million, payable based on collective performance in respect\nof Citi\u2019s Transformation goals over a multi-year performance\nperiod, divided into three parts, with payment allocated as\nfollows: 25% in February 2023, 25% in February 2024 and 50%\nFebruary 2025.\n\nThe program also will apply to other senior leaders critical to\nhelping deliver a successful Transformation, excluding Jane\nFraser, Citi\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, with the value varying\nbased on individual compensation levels. The portion of the\ntarget, if any, that the executives earn is tied to submission\nof suitable Transformation plans to Citi\u2019s regulators in the\nU.S., timely execution of required interim measures, timely\nexecution of highest-priority risk-reduction Transformation plan\ncomponents, sustainable metrics in program execution,\nresourcing, risk reduction, and data governance, and\ndemonstrable, quality leadership in all job specific aspects of\nthe Transformation. Awards actually earned may be less than, but\nnot greater than, the target. The Committee will evaluate the\ncollective performance of program participants against these\nmeasures, with the baseline payout percentage being generally\nconsistent across all participants.\n\nPayment for each part will be in cash, in a lump sum, with the\nthird payment indexed to changes in the value of Citi\u2019s common\nstock from the award date through the payment date.\n\nPayments in the event of any category of employment termination\nor change in job title or employment status are subject to\nCiti\u2019s discretion. Cancellation and clawback is provided for in\nthe event of misconduct and certain other circumstances.\n                               2                                \nItem 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
