Excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts,\nwhich included an approximate\n$400 million gain from the\nsale of the Taiwan consumer\nbanking business in the prior-\nyear period, revenues\nincreased 3%, driven by growth\nacross all reportable\noperating segments, partially\noffset by a decline in\nrevenues in All Other (managed\nbasis).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses decreased 2%\nversus the prior-year period.\nExcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts in both the current\nquarter and the prior-year\nperiod and a $56 million FDIC\nspecial assessment benefit in\nthe current quarter, expenses\ndecreased 1%. The decrease was\nprimarily driven by savings\nassociated with Citi\u2019s\norganizational simplification\nand stranded cost reductions,\npartially offset by volume-\nrelated expenses and continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation and other risk\nand control initiatives. (See\n\u201cExpenses\u201d below.)\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s cost of credit was\napproximately $2.7 billion\nversus $1.8 billion in the\nprior-year period. The\nincrease was largely driven by\nhigher cards net credit losses\nin Branded Cards and Retail\nServices in U.S. Personal\nBanking ( USPB ) and a higher\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL) build. The higher cards\nnet credit losses primarily\nreflected the continued\nmaturation of multiple cards\nloan vintages originated in\nrecent years, impacted by\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus during the\npandemic. In addition, the\nhigher ACL build was primarily\ndriven by changes in portfolio\ncomposition in the corporate\nportfolio and an increase in\ntransfer risk reserves\nassociated with unremittable\ncorporate dividends.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $2.1 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of common dividends and\nshare repurchases.\n\n\u2022 Citigroup\u2019s Common Equity\nTier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio\nunder the Basel III\nStandardized Approach\nincreased to 13.7% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared\nto 13.6% as of September 30,\n2023 (see \u201cCapital Resources\u201d\nbelow). This compares to\nCitigroup\u2019s required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nof 12.3% as of September 30,\n2024 and 12.0% as of September\n30, 2023 under the Basel III\nStandardized Approach.\nEffective October 1, 2024,\nCitigroup\u2019s required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\ndecreased to 12.1% from 12.3%\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, reflecting the\ndecrease in the Stress Capital\nBuffer (SCB) requirement to\n4.1% from 4.3% (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Stress Capital\nBuffer\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 Citi also continued to make\nprogress with the separation\nof its consumer banking and\nsmall business and middle-\nmarket banking operations in\nMexico in preparation for a\nplanned initial public\noffering and wind-downs of the\n\nKorea and China consumer\nbanking businesses and the\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbusinesses.\n                                                                \n  Third Quarter of 2024 Results Summary                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $3.2 billion, or $1.51 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $3.5 billion, or $1.63 per\nshare in the prior-year\nperiod. Net income decreased\n9% versus the prior-year\nperiod, driven by the higher\ncost of credit, partially\noffset by the higher revenue\nand the lower expenses.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nin the current quarter was\napproximately 25%, relatively\nunchanged from the prior-year\nperiod. Average diluted shares\noutstanding decreased 1%.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $20.3\nbillion increased 1% versus\nthe prior-year period, on a\nreported basis. Excluding the\ndivestiture-related impacts in\nboth periods, revenues of\n$20.3 billion increased 3%,\ndriven by growth across all\nreportable operating segments,\npartially offset by a decline\nin All Other (managed basis).\n(For additional information on\nthe divestiture-related\nimpacts, see \u201c All Other\n\u2014Divestiture-Related Impacts\n(Reconciling Items)\u201d below.)\n(As used throughout this Form\n10-Q, Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts\nare non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.)\n\nServices revenues were\nprimarily driven by higher\nnon-interest revenues in\nSecurities Services and\nTreasury and Trade Solutions\n(TTS). Markets revenues were\nlargely driven by strength in\nEquity Markets, while Banking\nrevenues largely reflected\ngrowth in Investment Banking.\nUSPB revenues benefited from\nloan growth in cards, as well\nas lower partner payments, and\nWealth revenues were primarily\ndriven by higher investment\nfee revenue.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $689 billion, up 3%\nversus the prior-year period,\nlargely reflecting loan growth\nin cards in USPB and higher\nloans in Markets and Services\n.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were approximately\n$1.3 trillion, up 3% versus\nthe prior-year period, largely\ndue to an increase in Services\n, driven by the continued\ndeepening of client\nrelationships and operating\ndeposit growth in both TTS and\nSecurities Services.

The increase was\nprimarily driven by higher net\ncredit losses in Branded Cards\nand Retail Services in USPB\nand a higher ACL build. The\nhigher cards net credit losses\nprimarily reflected continued\nmaturation of multiple cards\nloan vintages originated in\nrecent years, impacted by\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus during the\npandemic. In addition, the\nincrease was due to\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncards portfolios, with lower\nFICO band customers primarily\ndriving the increase. The\nincrease in the net ACL build\nwas due to changes in\nportfolio composition in the\ncorporate portfolio, an\nincrease in transfer risk\nreserves associated with\nunremittable corporate\ndividends and loan growth in\nthe consumer portfolio.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u2014Citi\u2019s\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n(ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $2.2\nbillion increased 33% from the\nprior-year period. Consumer\nnet credit losses of $2.1\nbillion increased 33%, largely\nreflecting the higher cards\nnet credit losses. Corporate\nnet credit losses increased to\n$74 million from $58 million.\nCiti continues to expect\nelevated consumer net credit\nlosses in the fourth quarter\nof 2024.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 13.7% as of September 30,\n2024, compared to 13.6% as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, based on\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets (RWA). The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby the net income and\nunrealized gains on available-\nfor-sale securities recognized\nin Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (AOCI) ,\npartially offset by the\npayment of common and\npreferred dividends, common\nshare repurchases and an\nincrease in RWA.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024,\nCiti paid approximately $1.1\nbillion of common dividends\nand repurchased approximately\n$1.0 billion of common shares\n(see \u201cUnregistered Sales of\nEquity Securities, Repurchases\nof Equity Securities and\nDividends\u201d below). Citi will\ncontinue to determine the\nlevel of common share\nrepurchases on a quarter-by-\nquarter basis given the\nuncertainty regarding future\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.

For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s capital\nratios and related components,\nsee \u201cCapital Resources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Services                                                      \n                                                                \nServices net income of $1.7\nbillion increased 23% from the\nprior-year period, driven by\nhigher revenues, partially\noffset by higher expenses and\nhigher cost of credit.\nServices expenses of $2.6\nbillion increased 3%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in technology,\nother risk and controls, and\nproduct innovation. Cost of\ncredit was $127 million,\ncompared to $95 million in the\nprior-year period. The\ncurrent-quarter ACL build was\nprimarily due to an increase\nin transfer risk associated\nwith unremittable corporate\ndividends outside of the U.S.\nbeing held on behalf of\nclients, driven by safety and\nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law.\n\nServices revenues of $5.0\nbillion increased 8%,\nprimarily reflecting continued\nmomentum across Securities\n\nServices and TTS. Non-interest\nrevenue increased 33%, driven\nby a smaller impact from\ncurrency devaluation in\nArgentina, as well as\ncontinued strength across\nunderlying fee drivers.\nExcluding the impact of the\nArgentine peso devaluation\n(approximately $42 million in\nthe current quarter and\napproximately $273 million in\nthe prior-year period), non-\ninterest revenue increased\n11%. Net interest income was\nlargely unchanged, as the\nbenefit of higher deposit\nvolumes was offset by a\ndecline in interest rates in\nArgentina. (As used throughout\nthis Form 10-Q, Services non-\ninterest revenue excluding the\nimpact of the Argentine peso\ndevaluation is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure.)\n\nTTS revenues of $3.6 billion\nincreased 4% from the prior-\nyear period. TTS non-interest\nrevenue increased 41%,\nprimarily driven by the\nsmaller impact from currency\ndevaluation in Argentina, an\nincrease in cross-border\ntransaction value of 8%, an\nincrease in U.S. dollar\nclearing volume of 7% and an\nincrease in commercial card\nspend volume of 8%. The\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue was partially offset\nby a 5% decline in net\ninterest income, driven by the\ndecline in interest rates in\nArgentina, partially offset by\nhigher deposit volumes.\n\nSecurities Services revenues\nof $1.4 billion increased 24%,\nlargely driven by a 23%\nincrease in net interest\nincome, primarily driven by\nhigher deposit spreads and\nvolumes, and a 24% increase in\nnon-interest revenue. The\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue was primarily driven\nby higher fees due to a 22%\nincrease in AUC/AUA balances,\nbenefiting from new client\nonboarding, deepening\nrelationships with existing\nclients and higher market\nvaluations.\n\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s exposure in\nArgentina, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Other Risk\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Argentina\u201d below.

Markets\nexpenses of $3.3 billion\nincreased 1%, primarily due to\nhigher volume-related\nexpenses. Cost of credit was\n$141 million versus $162\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The current-quarter\nnet ACL build was primarily\ndriven by changes in portfolio\ncomposition in spread\nproducts.\n\nMarkets revenues of $4.8\nbillion increased 1%, driven\nby growth in Equity Markets,\nup 32%, partially offset by a\n6% decline in Fixed Income\nMarkets. Equity Markets\nbenefited from growth in prime\nservices and higher volatility\nin equity derivatives, as well\nas higher cash equity volumes.\nThe decline in Fixed Income\nMarkets largely reflected a\ndecline in rates and\ncurrencies revenues, partially\noffset by higher revenues in\nspread products and other\nfixed income. Rates and\ncurrencies revenues decreased\n10%, reflecting a strong\nprior-year performance. Spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome revenues increased 5%,\ndriven by growth in asset-\nbacked financing,\nsecuritization activity and\nunderwriting fees, partially\noffset by lower commodities\nrevenue on lower gas\nvolatility.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nMarkets in the third quarter\nof 2024, see \u201c Markets \u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  Banking                                                       \n                                                                \nBanking net income was $238\nmillion, compared to net\nincome of $156 million in the\nprior-year period, driven by\nhigher revenues and lower\nexpenses, partially offset by\nhigher cost of credit.

Cost of\ncredit was $177 million,\nversus a benefit of $56\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by a net ACL\nbuild due to changes in\nportfolio composition.\n\nBanking revenues of $1.6\nbillion increased 16%,\nprimarily driven by growth in\nInvestment Banking. Investment\nBanking revenues increased\n31%, reflecting strength in\nDebt Capital Markets (DCM),\nwhich benefited from strong\nissuance activity in the\nquarter, an increase in\nAdvisory due to strong\nannounced deal volume from\nearlier this year coming to\nfruition as those deals close\nand an increase in Equity\nCapital Markets (ECM)\nreflecting stronger follow-on\nactivity, partially offset by\nless initial public offering\n(IPO) activity amid market\nvolatility mid quarter.\nCorporate Lending revenues\nwere largely unchanged,\nincluding the impact of the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges.\nExcluding the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges, Corporate Lending\nrevenues increased 5%, largely\ndriven by a smaller impact\nfrom currency devaluation in\nArgentina.

Cost of credit\nincreased to $1.9 billion,\ncompared to $1.5 billion in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby higher net credit losses,\npartially offset by a lower\nnet ACL build. Net credit\nlosses increased 39%,\nprimarily reflecting the\ncontinued maturation of\nmultiple cards loan vintages\noriginated in recent years,\nimpacted by unprecedented\nlevels of government stimulus\nduring the pandemic. In\naddition, the increase was due\nto macroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncards portfolios, with lower\nFICO band customers primarily\ndriving the increase. The ACL\nbuild of $45 million was\nprimarily driven by loan\ngrowth.\n\nUSPB revenues of $5.0 billion\nincreased 3%, driven by an\nincrease in net interest\nincome due to loan growth in\ncards, and higher non-interest\nrevenue due to lower partner\npayments.

Cost of\ncredit was $33 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $2\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely due to an ACL\nbuild for loans, compared to a\nrelease in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nWealth revenues of $2.0\nbillion increased 9%, driven\nby a 15% increase in non-\ninterest revenue, reflecting\nhigher investment fee revenues\non momentum in client\ninvestment assets, as well as\na 6% increase in net interest\nincome due to higher deposit\nvolumes and spreads. Private\nBank revenues of $614 million\nwere largely unchanged from\nthe prior-year period.

All Other\n(managed basis) expenses of\n$2.1 billion decreased 5%,\nprimarily driven by lower\nexpenses from the closed exits\nand wind-downs, partially\noffset by a legal reserve.\nCost of credit of $289 million\nincreased 45%, largely\nreflecting a net ACL build\ndriven by Mexico Consumer,\ncompared to an ACL release in\nthe prior-year period.\n\nAll Other (managed basis)\nrevenues decreased 18% from\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by lower\nrevenues in Corporate/Other\nand Legacy Franchises (managed\nbasis). Legacy Franchises\n(managed basis) revenues were\n$1.7 billion, a decline of 6%\nfrom the prior-year period,\nlargely driven by lower\nrevenues in Asia Consumer\n(managed basis) due to the\nclosed exits and wind-downs.\nCorporate/Other revenues\ndecreased to $86 million, from\n$397 million in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by\nmargin compression on mortgage\nsecurities in the investment\nportfolio that have extended.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nAll Other (managed basis) in\nthe third quarter of 2024, see\n\u201c All Other \u2014Divestiture-\nRelated Impacts (Reconciling\nItems)\u201d and \u201c All Other\n(Managed Basis)\u201d below.\n\nMacroeconomic and Other Risks\nand Uncertainties\n\nVarious geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic and regulatory\nchallenges and uncertainties\ncontinue to pose risks to\neconomic conditions in the\nU.S. and globally, including,\namong others, potential policy\nand other changes resulting\nfrom the incoming U.S.\nadministration and Congress,\ncentral bank interest rate\npolicies, unemployment levels,\neconomic growth rates,\nconflicts in the Middle East,\neconomic conditions and\ntensions involving China and\nthe Russia\u2013Ukraine war.

8%,\nprimarily reflecting higher\nrevenues in Securities\nServices and TTS. The increase\nin revenues was driven by\nhigher non-interest revenue\n(up 33%), largely due to a\nsmaller impact of the\nArgentine peso devaluation.\nExcluding the impact of the\nArgentine peso devaluation\n(approximately $42 million in\nthe current quarter and\napproximately $273 million in\nthe prior-year period), non-\ninterest revenue increased\n11%, driven by continued\nstrength across underlying fee\ndrivers in TTS and Securities\nServices. Net interest income\nwas largely unchanged, as the\nbenefit of higher deposit\nvolumes was offset by a\ndecline in interest rates in\nArgentina. Average deposits\nincreased 4%, driven by growth\nin both Securities Services\nand TTS, as Citi continued to\nincrease operating deposits in\nboth businesses.\n\nTTS revenues increased 4%, as\na 41% increase in non-interest\nrevenues was partially offset\nby a 5% decrease in net\ninterest income. The increase\nin non-interest revenue was\ndriven by the smaller impact\nfrom currency devaluation in\nArgentina, as well as growth\nin underlying fee drivers,\nincluding cross-border\ntransaction value (up 8%),\nU.S. dollar clearing volume\n(up 7%) and commercial card\nspend volume (up 8%). The\ndecrease in net interest\nincome was driven by the\n\ndecline in interest rates in\nArgentina, partially offset by\nhigher deposit volumes.\nAverage deposits increased 2%,\ndriven by growth in both North\nAmerica and International.

Average deposits\nincreased 13%, driven by\ngrowth in both North America\nand International. The growth\nin non-interest revenue was\nprimarily driven by the\nincrease in volume-related\nfees due to a 22% increase in\nAUC/AUA balances, benefiting\nfrom new client onboarding,\ndeepening relationships with\nexisting clients and higher\nmarket valuations, as well as\ncontinued elevated levels of\ncorporate activity in Issuer\nServices.\n\nExpenses increased 3%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in technology,\nother risk and controls and\nproduct innovation.\n\nProvisions were $127 million,\ncompared to $95 million in the\nprior-year period. The\ncurrent-quarter net ACL build\nof $113 million, compared to\n$68 million in the prior-year\nperiod, was largely due to an\nincrease in transfer risk\nassociated with unremittable\ncorporate dividends outside\nthe U.S. being held on behalf\nof clients, driven by safety\nand\n                               13                               \nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law.

The net ACL build in\nthe current period was\nprimarily driven by an\nincrease in transfer risk\nassociated with unremittable\ncorporate dividends outside\nthe U.S. being held on behalf\nof clients, driven by safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law,\npartially offset by an\nimproved macroeconomic\noutlook.\n                               14                               \n                                                                \n  MARKETS                                                       \n                                                                \nMarkets provides corporate, institutional and public sector\nclients around the world with a full range of sales and trading\nservices across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread\nproducts and commodities. The range of services includes market-\nmaking across asset classes, risk management solutions,\nfinancing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and\nsettlement.\n\nAs a market maker, Markets facilitates transactions, including\nholding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the\ndifferential between the price at which it buys and sells the\nproducts. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and\nlosses on the inventory are recorded in Principal transactions .\nOther primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-\nfor-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity\nsecurities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring\ngains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less\ninterest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding\ntransactions and customer deposits, is recorded as Net interest\nincome.\n\nThe amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a\nvariety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity;\nchanges in market variables such as interest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor\nconfidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. Markets revenues\ninclude revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue\nsharing arrangement with Banking \u2014Corporate Lending for\nInvestment Banking, Markets and Services products sold to\nCorporate Lending clients.\n\nAssuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in\nclient activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in\nincreases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can\nsignificantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads\nand the fair value of product inventory. Management of the\nMarkets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of\nthe above factors.\n\nMarkets \u2019 international presence is supported by trading floors\nin approximately 80

The\nnet ACL build in the current\nquarter was primarily driven\nby changes in portfolio\ncomposition in spread products\n.

Hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market\non credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate\nloan accrual portfolio.

Average\ndeposits decreased 23%,\nlargely reflecting the\ntransfers of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits to Wealth\n($26 billion at the time of\ntransfer over the last 12\nmonths).\n\nExpenses decreased 1%, driven\nby continued productivity\nsavings, partially offset by\nhigher volume-related\nexpenses.\n\nProvisions were $1.9 billion,\ncompared to $1.5 billion in\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby higher net credit losses,\npartially offset by a lower\nnet ACL build for loans. Net\ncredit losses of $1.9 billion\nincreased 39%, primarily\nreflecting the continued\nmaturation of multiple cards\nloan vintages originated in\nrecent years, impacted by\nunprecedented levels of\ngovernment stimulus during the\npandemic. In addition, the\nincrease was driven by\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment impacting both\ncards portfolios, with lower\nFICO band customers primarily\ndriving the increase. Branded\nCards net credit losses of\n$1.0 billion increased 41%,\nand Retail Services net credit\nlosses of $0.8 billion\nincreased 38%.\n\nThe net ACL build was $45\nmillion, compared to $116\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The net ACL build in\nthe current quarter primarily\nreflected loan growth.

The higher net ACL\nrelease was primarily driven\nby a change in the ACL\nassociated with the margin\nlending portfolio.\n                               24                               \nALL OTHER\u2014Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)\n\nAll Other includes activities not assigned to the reportable\noperating segments ( Services , Markets , Banking , USPB and\nWealth ), including Legacy Franchises and Corporate/Other.

Citi continues\nto monitor developments\nrelated to this rulemaking.\n\nThe capital proposal would\nmaintain the current capital\nrule\u2019s dual-requirement\nstructure for RWA, but would\neliminate the use of internal\nmodels to calculate credit\nrisk and operational risk\ncomponents of RWA. The capital\nproposal would also replace\nthe current market risk\nframework with a new\nstandardized methodology and a\nnew models-based methodology\nfor calculating RWA for market\nrisk. Large banking\norganizations, such as Citi,\nwould be required to calculate\ntheir risk-based capital\nratios under both the new\nexpanded risk-based approach\nand the Standardized Approach\nand use the lower of the two\nfor each risk-based capital\nratio for determining the\nbinding constraints.\n\nThe expanded risk-based\napproach is designed to align\nwith the international capital\nstandards adopted by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee).\nThe Basel Committee finalized\nthe Basel III reforms in\nDecember 2017, which included\nrevisions to the methodologies\nto determine credit, market\nand operational RWA amounts.\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the\ncapital proposal\u2019s impact on\nRWA amounts would also affect\nseveral other requirements\nincluding TLAC, external long-\nterm debt and the short-term\nwholesale funding score\nincluded in the GSIB surcharge\nunder method 2 (see \u201cGSIB\nSurcharge\u201d below). The\nproposal has a three-year\ntransition period that would\nbegin on July 1, 2025. If\nfinalized as proposed, the\ncapital proposal would\nmaterially increase Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory capital.\n\nFor information about risks\nrelated to changes in\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks,\u201d\n\u201c\u2014Operational Risks\u201d and\n\u201c\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  GSIB Surcharge                                                \n                                                                \nSeparately on July 27, 2023,\nthe FRB proposed changes to\nthe GSIB surcharge rule that\naim to make it more risk\nsensitive. Proposed changes\ninclude measuring certain\nsystemic indicators on a daily\nversus quarterly average\nbasis, changing certain of the\nrisk indicators and shortening\nthe time to come into\ncompliance with each year\u2019s\nsurcharge. In addition, the\nproposal would narrow\nsurcharge bands under method 2\nfrom 50 bps to 10 bps to\nreduce cliff effects when\nmoving between bands.\n                                                                \n  Long-Term Debt Requirements                                   \n                                                                \nOn August 29, 2023, the FRB\nissued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking to amend the TLAC\nrule to change the haircuts\n(i.e., the percentage\nreductions) that are applied\nto eligible long-term debt.\nUnder the proposed rule, only\n50% of eligible long-term debt\nwith a maturity of one year or\nmore but less than two years\nwould count toward the TLAC\nrequirement, instead of the\ncurrent 100%. These proposed\nrevisions are estimated to\ndecrease the TLAC percentage\nof Advanced Approaches RWA as\nwell as the TLAC percentage of\nTotal Leverage Exposure.

The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citi believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of September 30,\n2024. Citi has applied\nmanagement judgment to adjust\ninternal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been observed.\n                               45                               \nAs obligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

The\nportfolio is generally\ndelinquency managed, where\nCiti evaluates credit risk\nbased on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 14. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe third quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nBanking was unchanged quarter-\nover-quarter, and increased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the growth and\nseasoning of personal loans.\nThe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate was largely\nunchanged quarter-over-\nquarter, and decreased year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nlower delinquencies in U.S.\nmortgages.\n          \n  Wealth  \n          \nAs indicated above, Wealth\nprovides consumer mortgages,\nmargin lending, credit cards\nand other lending products to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom affluent to ultra-high\nnet worth through the Private\nBank, Wealth at Work and\nCitigold businesses. These\ncustomer segments represent a\ntarget market that is\ncharacterized by historically\nlow default rates and\ndelinquencies and includes\nloans that are delinquency\nmanaged or classifiably\nmanaged. The delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio consists\nprimarily of mortgages, margin\nlending and credit cards. As\nof September 30, 2024,\napproximately $44 billion, or\n29%, of the portfolios were\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of\nmortgage loans, margin loans,\npersonal and small business\nloans and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit risk\nbased on their internal risk\nrating, of which 72% were\nrated investment grade. While\nthe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rates shown in the\nchart above were calculated\nonly for the delinquency-\nmanaged portfolio, the net\ncredit loss rates shown were\ncalculated using net credit\nlosses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As\npresented in the chart above,\nthe third quarter of 2024 net\ncredit loss rate and 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate in\nWealth were broadly stable\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year. The low net credit\nloss and 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rates continued to\nreflect the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\n                               52                               \n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex and\nprovides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nMexico Consumer serves a mass-\nmarket segment in Mexico and\nfocuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As presented\nin the chart above, the third\nquarter of 2024 net credit\nloss rate in Mexico Consumer\nincreased quarter-over-\nquarter, primarily driven by\nseasonality, and increased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the ongoing\nnormalization of loss rates\nfrom post-pandemic lows. The\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate increased quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the\nongoing normalization from\npost-pandemic lows.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $60 million ($0.5 billion), $63 million ($0.5\nbillion) and $61 million ($0.5 billion) at September 30, 2024,\nJune 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $69 million, $75 million and $70 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed\nloans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail\nServices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status, and, therefore,\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 72%,\n75% and 95% of Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated\ninvestment grade. For additional information on the credit\nquality of the Wealth portfolio, including classifiably managed\nportfolios, see \u201cConsumer Credit Trends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and\nRussia for all periods presented.\n\n(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nConsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and, hence, the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nmost recent reclassifications commenced as follows: Taiwan and\nIndonesia in the first quarter of 2022; Taiwan closed in the\nthird quarter of 2023 and Indonesia closed in the fourth quarter\nof 2023. See Note 2.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies.

Corporate non-accrual loans\nmay still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within\nCorporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\n(2) Approximately 64%, 68%, 61%, 50% and 62% of Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal\npayments at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024,\nDecember 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n(3) The September 30, 2024 total corporate non-accrual loans\nrepresented 0.31% of total corporate loans.\n\n(4) The increase at September 30, 2023 was primarily related to\ntwo commercial real estate loans. The decrease at June 30, 2024\nwas primarily related to commercial real estate loans.\n\n(5) Asia Consumer includes balances in Poland and Russia for all\nperiods presented.\n

Liquidity\nRisk Management Policy\n(Policy), which sets forth the\nminimum requirements for\nidentifying, measuring,\nmonitoring, controlling and\nreporting liquidity risk,\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite in conjunction with\nlocal treasurers and with\noversight provided by\nIndependent Risk Management\nand the Citigroup Asset and\nLiability Committee (ALCO).\nThe Policy establishes the\nframework for sound management\nof Citi\u2019s liquidity risk, to\nfacilitate transparency and\ncomparability of liquidity\nrisk-taking activities, and\nsupports Citi\u2019s maintenance of\nadequate liquidity, including\na cushion of unencumbered,\nhigh-quality liquid assets, to\nwithstand a range of stress\nevents including those\ninvolving the loss or\nimpairment of both unsecured\nand secured funding sources.\n\nCiti\u2019s enterprise-wide\nliquidity management framework\nestablishes a risk appetite\nthat is expressed as a set of\nquantitative minimum levels\nfor Citigroup and Citibank,\nconsolidated to maintain\nliquidity levels above limits\nfor the U.S. Liquidity\nCoverage ratio (LCR), U.S. Net\nStable Funding ratio (NSFR)\nand Internal Liquidity Stress\nTests (ILST). Liquidity\nconcentration risk, which is\ndefined as liquidity risk due\nto funding concentration to a\nspecific counterparty,\nindustry, product type or\nmaturity, among other\ncategories, is an integral\npart of Citi\u2019s liquidity\nmanagement framework and is\nmanaged in accordance with\nestablished risk appetite\nlimits. For example, product\nor industry concentration\nlimits consider specific\nattributes of a product (e.g.,\nwholesale deposits, secured\nversus unsecured, etc.).\n\nSimilar requirements\napplicable to country legal\nentities, material legal\nentities (as defined in the\npublic section of Citi\u2019s 2023\nresolution plan) or other\nlegal entities are specified\nin the Liquidity Risk\nManagement Procedures\n(Procedures). The Procedures\nprovide for liquidity risk\nmanagement, risk\nidentification, risk appetite,\nrisk limits and triggers, and\nmonitoring including\nescalation, stress testing,\nrisk reporting, training and\nreview, oversight and approval\nof key liquidity risk\nproposals, and analytical\ntools applicable to the\nentities within the\nProcedures\u2019 scope. In\naddition, the Procedures\nprovide for data governance,\nroles and responsibilities,\nand reference to frameworks\nwithin Citi\u2019s liquidity\nmanagement.\n\nLiquidity risk in foreign\njurisdictions and legal\nentities is managed as part of\nCiti\u2019s legal entity liquidity\nmanagement framework (similar\nto Citigroup and Citibank), in\nwhich legal entities,\nincluding those in foreign\njurisdictions, are subject to\nregulatory and internal\nliquidity stress tests on a\nstandalone basis, managed\nagainst legal entity limits\nset in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite and governed by\nlocal governance forums.

For securities,\nthe amounts represent the\nliquidity value that\npotentially could be realized\nand, therefore, exclude any\nsecurities that are encumbered\nand incorporate any haircuts\napplicable under the U.S. LCR\nrule. The table above\nincorporates various\nrestrictions that could limit\nthe transferability of\nliquidity between legal\nentities, including Section\n23A of the Federal Reserve\nAct. Changes in HQLA line\ncategories from the prior-year\nperiod were primarily driven\nby the re-allocation of\nnontransferable HQLA, which\ndid not change total average\nHQLA, and thus did not impact\nCiti\u2019s LCR ratio.\n\n(1) Foreign government debt\nincludes securities issued or\nguaranteed by foreign\nsovereigns, agencies and\nmultilateral development\nbanks. Foreign government debt\nsecurities are held largely to\nsupport local liquidity\nrequirements and Citi\u2019s local\nfranchises and principally\ninclude government bonds from\nJapan, Korea, Mexico, India\nand Hong Kong.\n\nThe table above includes\naverage amounts of HQLA held\nat Citigroup\u2019s operating\nentities that are eligible for\ninclusion in the calculation\nof Citigroup\u2019s consolidated\nLCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR\nrules. These amounts include\nthe HQLA needed to meet the\nminimum requirements at these\nentities as well as any\namounts in excess of these\nminimums that are available to\nbe transferred to other\nentities within Citigroup.\nCitigroup\u2019s average HQLA\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nas of the third quarter of\n2024, primarily driven by an\nincrease in non-U.S. sovereign\ndebt. As of September 30,\n2024, Citigroup had\napproximately $959 billion of\navailable liquidity resources\nto support client and business\nneeds, including end-of-period\nHQLA ($561 billion);\nadditional unencumbered HQLA,\nincluding excess liquidity\nheld at bank entities that is\nnon-transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup\n($252 billion); and unused\nborrowing capacity from\navailable assets not already\naccounted for within Citi\u2019s\nHQLA to support additional\nadvances from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and the\nFederal Reserve Bank discount\nwindow ($146 billion).\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR.

Citi\u2019s\ndeposit base is spread across\na diversified set of\ncountries, industries, clients\nand currencies and is subject\nto Citi\u2019s Liquidity Risk\nManagement Policy and\nProcedures. End-of-period\ndeposits increased 3% year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\ngrowth in Services ,\nreflecting operating deposit\ngrowth. End-of-period deposits\nincreased 2% sequentially,\nprimarily driven by growth in\nTTS and Securities Services.\nOn an average basis, deposits\nwere largely unchanged both\nyear-over-year and\nsequentially. In the third\nquarter of 2024, average\ndeposits for: \u2022 Services\nincreased 4% year-over-year,\nas TTS increased 2% and\nSecurities Services increased\n13%. The net increase was\nprimarily attributable to\ngrowth in Services operating\ndeposits. \u2022 USPB decreased 23%\nyear-over-year, as the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits to Wealth\nmore than offset underlying\ndeposit growth. \u2022 Wealth\nincreased 4% year-over-year,\nlargely reflecting the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposits from USPB\n, partially offset by the\nshift in deposits to higher-\nyielding investments on Citi\u2019s\nplatform. \u2022 All Other\ndecreased 18% year-over-year,\nprimarily reflecting the\ncontinued wind-down of\ndeposits in Legacy Franchises.\nThe majority of Citi\u2019s $1.3\ntrillion of end-of-period\ndeposits are institutional\n(approximately $840 billion)\nand span 90 countries. A large\nmajority of these\ninstitutional deposits are\nwithin TTS, and of these,\napproximately 80% are from\nclients that use all three TTS\nintegrated services: payments\nand collections, liquidity\nmanagement and working capital\nsolutions.

As part of its\nliability management, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs.

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nissuances and borrowings from\nthe FHLB and other market\nparticipants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nwith a smaller portion\nexecuted through Citi\u2019s bank\nentities to efficiently fund\nboth (i) secured lending\nactivity and (ii) a portion of\nthe securities inventory held\nin the context of market\nmaking and customer\nactivities. Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $278\nbillion as of September 30,\n2024 increased 8% year-over-\nyear and decreased 9% from the\nprior quarter, largely driven\nby additional financing to\nsupport increases in trading-\nrelated assets within Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries. As\nof the quarter ended September\n30, 2024, on an average basis,\nsecured funding was $338\nbillion. The portion of\nsecured funding in the broker-\ndealer subsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity and is primarily\nsecured by high-quality liquid\nsecurities such as U.S.\nTreasury securities, U.S.\nagency securities and foreign\ngovernment debt securities.\nOther \u201cmatched book\u201d activity\nis secured by less liquid\nsecurities, including equity\nsecurities, corporate bonds\nand asset-backed securities,\nthe tenor of which is\ngenerally equal to or longer\nthan the tenor of the\ncorresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $41 billion as of September\n30, 2024 decreased 4% year-\nover-year, as issuances of\nlong-term debt replaced the\nneed for short-term\nborrowings. Sequentially,\nshort-term borrowings\nincreased 7%, compared to June\n30, 2024, driven by additional\nfunding to support client\nactivities (see Note 18 for\nfurther information on\nCitigroup\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 outstanding short-\nterm borrowings).\n                               68                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nThe table below presents the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of September 30,\n2024.

Other funding sources,\nsuch as secured financing\ntransactions and other margin\nrequirements, for which there\nare no explicit triggers,\ncould also be adversely\naffected.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.1\nbillion (unchanged from June\n30, 2024). Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfunding transactions and other\nmargin requirements, for which\nthere are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of September 30,\n2024, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank\nacross all three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$0.2 billion (unchanged from\nJune 30, 2024). As detailed\nunder \u201cHigh-Quality Liquid\nAssets (HQLA)\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of September\n30, 2024, Citibank had\nliquidity commitments of\napproximately $11.1 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits\n(compared to $10.8 billion at\nJune 30, 2024) (see Note 21).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               69                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from the second line\nof defense team reporting to\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in the level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rates\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in the maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in the interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nCiti utilizes the most recent\nquarter-end balance sheet,\nassuming no changes to its\ncomposition and size over the\nforecasted horizon (holding\nthe balance sheet static). The\nforecasts incorporate\nexpectations and assumptions\nof deposit pricing, loan\nspreads and mortgage\nprepayment behavior implied by\nthe interest rate curves in\neach scenario. The base case\nscenario reflects the market-\nimplied forward interest\nrates, and sensitivity\nscenarios assume instantaneous\nshocks to the base case. The\nforecasts do not assume Citi\ntakes any risk-mitigating\nactions in response to changes\nin the interest rate\nenvironment. Certain interest\nrates are subject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities (i.e., deposit\nbetas) are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n\nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nvalue at risk (VAR). It\nexcludes impacts from any\npositions that are included in\ntotal trading and credit\nportfolio VAR.\n\nIn addition to IRE, Citi\nanalyzes economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) as a longer-\nterm interest rate risk\nmetric. EVS is a net present\nvalue (NPV)\u2013based measure of\nthe lifetime cash flows of\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book. It\nestimates the interest rate\nsensitivity of the Banking\nBook\u2019s economic value from\nlonger-term assets being\npotentially funded with\nshorter-term liabilities, or\nvice versa. Citi manages EVS\nwithin risk limits approved by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of Directors\nthat are aligned with Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite.\n                               70                               \nInterest Rate Risk of\nInvestment Portfolios\u2014Impact\non AOCI\n\nCiti measures the potential\nimpacts of changes in interest\nrates on the value of its AOCI\n, which can in turn impact\nCiti\u2019s common equity and\ntangible common equity. This\nwill impact Citi\u2019s CET1 and\nother regulatory capital\nratios. Citi seeks to manage\nits exposure to changes in the\nmarket level of interest\nrates, while limiting the\npotential impact on its AOCI\nand regulatory capital\nposition.\n\nAOCI at risk is managed as\npart of the Company-wide\ninterest rate risk position.\nAOCI at risk considers\npotential\n\nchanges in AOCI (and the\ncorresponding impact on the\nCET1 Capital ratio) relative\nto Citi\u2019s capital generation\ncapacity.\n\nCiti uses 100 basis point\n(bps) shocks in each scenario\nto reflect its net interest\nincome sensitivity to\nunanticipated changes in\nmarket interest rates, as\npotential monetary policy\ndecisions and changes in\neconomic conditions may be\nreflected in current market-\nimplied forward rates.

The remaining\nimpact is spread across more\nthan 30 additional currencies.\n\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet is asset\nsensitive (assets reprice\nfaster than liabilities),\nresulting in higher net\ninterest income in increasing\ninterest rate scenarios. The\nestimated impact to Citi's net\ninterest income in a 100 bps\nupward rate shock scenario as\nof September 30, 2024 remained\nrelatively stable year-over-\nyear. At progressively higher\ninterest rate levels, the\nmarginal net interest income\nbenefit is lower, as Citi\nassumes it will pass on a\nlarger share of rate changes\nto depositors (i.e., higher\nbetas), further reducing\nCiti\u2019s IRE sensitivity.\nCurrency-specific interest\nrate changes and balance sheet\nfactors may drive quarter-to-\nquarter volatility in Citi\u2019s\nestimated IRE.\n\nIn a 100 bps upward rate shock\nscenario, Citi expects that\nthe approximate $1.2 billion\ninitial negative impact to\nAOCI could potentially be\noffset in shareholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio and expected net\ninterest income benefit over a\nperiod of approximately seven\nmonths.\n                               71                               \n                                                                \n  Scenario Analysis                                             \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income and AOCI\nunder six different scenarios\nof changes in interest rates\nfor the U.S. dollar and all\nother currencies in which Citi\nhas invested capital as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The 100\nbps downward rate scenarios\npotentially may be impacted by\nthe low level of interest\nrates in several countries and\nthe assumption that market\ninterest rates, as well as\nrates paid to depositors and\ncharged to borrowers, do not\nfall below zero (i.e., the\n\u201cflooring assumption\u201d).

As a\nresult, in higher interest\nrate scenarios, customer\nactivity resulting in a shift\nfrom non-interest-bearing and\nlow interest rate deposit\nproducts to higher-yielding\ndeposits would reduce the\nexpected benefit to net\ninterest income. Conversely,\nin lower interest rate\nscenarios, customer activity\nresulting in a shift from\nhigher-yielding deposits to\nnon-interest-bearing and low\ninterest rate deposit products\nwould reduce the expected\ndecrease to net interest\nincome.\n\n(1) The Scenario 1 impact of\n$1,388 million consists of the\nfollowing top five non-U.S.\ndollar currencies as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 by absolute\nsize: approximately $(0.3)\nbillion from the euro, $0.4\nbillion from the British pound\nsterling, and approximately\n$0.1 billion each from the\nJapanese yen, Indian rupee and\nSwiss franc. The remaining\nbalance is spread across more\nthan 30 additional currencies.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs presented in the table\nabove, the estimated impact to\nCiti\u2019s net interest income is\nlarger under Scenario 2 than\nScenario 3, as Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook has relatively higher\ninterest rate exposure to the\nshort end of the yield curve.\nFor U.S. dollars, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is\nsmaller in magnitude than to\nupward rate shocks. This is\nbecause of the lower benefit\nto net interest income from\nCiti\u2019s deposit base at higher\nrate levels, as well as the\nprepayment effects on mortgage\nloans and mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 compared to Scenario 3. This\nis because Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio and pension\nliabilities are more sensitive\nto rates at shorter- and\nintermediate-term maturities.\n                               72                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.6 billion,\nor 1.0%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\neuro, Mexican peso and Indian\nrupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s RWA\ndenominated in those same\ncurrencies. This,\n\ncoupled with Citi\u2019s foreign\ncurrency hedging strategies,\nsuch as foreign currency\nborrowings, foreign currency\nforwards and other currency\nhedging instruments, lessens\nthe impact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s CET1\nCapital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are presented\nin the table below.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of September 30, 2024, there was one\nback-testing exception observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR in the\nlast 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\n                               81                               \n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of September 30, 2024.\n(Including the U.S., Citi\u2019s\ntop 25 exposures by country\nwould represent approximately\n98% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries as of September 30,\n2024.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower. For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China.

In accordance\nwith a Central Bank of Russia regulatory requirement, all\nbalances in the National Settlements Depository were transferred\nto the DIA in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n(5) The majority of AO Citibank\u2019s third-party exposures were\nfunded with the dividends described in footnote 4 and domestic\ndeposit liabilities from both corporate and personal banking\nclients.\n\n(6) Citigroup\u2019s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its\nindirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above\ntable, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would\nbe recognized in Citigroup\u2019s earnings only upon either the\nsubstantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank.\nCiti has separately described these risks in \u201cDeconsolidation\nRisk\u201d below.\n                               83                               \nDuring the third quarter of\n2024, Citi\u2019s Russia-related\nexposures increased by $0.9\nbillion, to $9.1 billion as\npresented in the table above.\nThe increase in exposures was\nprimarily driven by inflows\nfrom dividends received from\nRussian corporations on behalf\nof Citi\u2019s clients, partially\noffset by depreciation of the\nRussian ruble. Approximately\n82% of Citi\u2019s $9.1 billion of\ntotal Russia-related exposures\nare corporate dividends that\nCiti cannot remit to its\nclients due to restrictions\nimposed by the Russian\ngovernment, of which $5.8\nbillion is held with the\nDeposit Insurance Agency.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $0.2\nbillion as of September 30,\n2024 (up from $0.1 billion at\nJune 30, 2024). This increase\nin the net investment was due\nto an increase in interest\nincome and custody revenue\nduring the quarter, partially\noffset by the impact from a\nnet ACL build on other assets,\ndriven by increases in\ntransfer risk for safety and\nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law. For more\ninformation on transfer risk\nreserves, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u2014Citi\u2019s\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n(ACL)\u201d below.\n\nCiti hedges its Russian\nruble/U.S. dollar spot FX\nexposure in AOCI through the\npurchase of FX derivatives.\nThe ongoing mark-to-market of\nthe hedging derivatives is\nalso reported in AOCI . When\nthe Russian ruble depreciates\nagainst the U.S. dollar, the\nU.S. dollar equivalent value\nof Citigroup\u2019s investment in\nAO Citibank also declines.\nThis change in value is offset\nby the change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative). Going forward,\nCiti may record devaluations\non its net ruble-denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nthe benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposures.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nServices , Markets , Banking\nand All Other \u2014Legacy\nFranchises results have been\nimpacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including the\nwar in Ukraine and its direct\nand indirect impacts on the\nEuropean and global economies.\nFor a broader discussion of\nthese factors and volatilities\non Citi\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\napplicable business\u2019s results\nof operations above.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$0.1 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct\nRussian counterparties\n(largely unchanged from June\n30, 2024).

In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi has incurred\napproximately $71 million to\ndate in charges, largely from\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, Citi\ncontinued to consolidate AO\nCitibank because none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank, Citi\u2019s foreign\nentity in Russia, Citi would\nbe required to (i) write off\nthe net investment of\napproximately $0.2 billion (up\nfrom $0.1 billion at June 30,\n2024), (ii) recognize a CTA\nloss of approximately $1.6\nbillion (unchanged from June\n30, 2024) through earnings and\n(iii) recognize a loss of $0.7\nbillion (unchanged from June\n30, 2024) on net intercompany\nliabilities owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve. The $1.6 billion CTA\nwrite-off through earnings\nunder either event is expected\nto be largely equity neutral,\nsince the reversal of the CTA\nloss out of AOCI would improve\nCiti\u2019s total AOCI .\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients               \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n                               84                               \nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or block\nthe funds until applicable\nsanctions are lifted or the\npayments are otherwise\nauthorized under applicable\nlaw.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its remaining\npresence in Russia and\nassociation with Russian\nindividuals or entities,\nwhether subject to sanctions\nor not, including Citi\u2019s\ninability to support its\nglobal clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

The reports to\nthe Board and its Committees\nfrom senior management who\nrepresent the impacted\nbusinesses and the\ninternational cluster,\nIndependent Risk Management,\nFinance, Independent\nCompliance Risk Management,\nincluding those individuals\nresponsible for sanctions\ncompliance, and Human\nResources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has provided\nupdates to Citi\u2019s Executive\nManagement Team and the Board,\noutside of formal meetings,\nregarding cybersecurity\nmatters (including Russia-\nspecific risks).\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 215\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, Citi had\n$1.5 billion of direct\nexposures related to Ukraine\n(unchanged from June 30,\n2024).\n                               85                               \n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its Services , Markets\nand Banking businesses. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.3 billion (compared to $1.4\nbillion at June 30, 2024).\nCiti uses the U.S. dollar\n(USD) as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\ncountries such as Argentina\nthat are deemed highly\ninflationary in accordance\nwith GAAP. Citi therefore\nrecords the impact of exchange\nrate fluctuations on its net\nArgentine peso\n(ARS)\u2013denominated assets\ndirectly in earnings. Citi\nuses Argentina\u2019s official\nmarket exchange rate to\nremeasure its net ARS-\ndenominated assets into USD.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the\nofficial ARS exchange rate was\n971, which devalued by 6.5%\nagainst the USD during the\nthird quarter of 2024.\n\nThe decrease in Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Argentina during\nthe quarter was primarily\ndriven by capital\nrepatriations from the onshore\nnet investment, which were\nauthorized by the Central Bank\nof Argentina (BCRA) on a one-\ntime basis in April 2024\nthrough the purchase of\ncertain USD-denominated bonds\n(BOPREALs) issued by the BCRA\nin a primary auction, and\nsubsequent sales of the bonds\nin the secondary market and\nremittances of the bond\nproceeds to the parent entity\noutside Argentina. During the\nthird quarter, Citi remitted\napproximately $247 million in\ndividends from its net\ninvestment in Argentina,\nthereby reducing future FX\ndevaluation risk. In total,\n$435 million of dividends were\nremitted in 2024 due to the\nsale proceeds of the BOPREALs.\n\nIn addition to the capital\nrepatriation, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in Argentina was\nalso impacted by earnings from\nCiti\u2019s normal onshore\noperations and interest income\nearned on the net investment,\npartially offset by FX\ntranslation losses on the net\ninvestment.\n\nOther than the authorized\ndividend remittance described\nabove, the BCRA continues to\nmaintain certain capital and\ncurrency controls that\ngenerally restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access USD in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nThe capital and currency\ncontrols have resulted in\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms that some Argentine\nentities may use to obtain\nUSD, generally at rates that\nare significantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\ngenerally precluded from\naccessing these alternative\nmechanisms, and under U.S.\nGAAP, these exchange\nmechanisms cannot be used to\nre-measure Citi\u2019s net monetary\nassets into USD. If\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate further converges with\nthe approximate rate implied\nby the indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms, Citi\ncould incur additional\ntranslation losses on its net\ninvestment in Argentina.\nAccordingly, Citi seeks to\nreduce its overall ARS\nexposure in Argentina while\ncomplying with local capital\nand currency exposure\nlimitations.\n\nOf the $1.3 billion net\ninvestment in Argentina as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, Citi\u2019s net\nARS exposure was approximately\n$0.9 billion (compared to $0.8\nbillion as of June 30, 2024).\nThe net ARS exposure was\nreduced as of the end of the\nquarter as a result of Citi\nholding approximately $200\nmillion of USD-denominated\nloans as well as approximately\n$200 million of certain local\ngovernment bonds that are USD\ndenominated. If Citi had not\ninvested in such instruments\nto reduce its ARS exposure,\nCiti would have recognized\nadditional translation losses\nduring the third quarter of\n2024. Given current economic\nconditions and the local\ncapital, currency and\nregulatory limitations, Citi\ncannot guarantee the\navailability or effectiveness\nof such mechanisms to reduce\nits ARS exposure in the\nfuture.\n\nIn addition to reducing the\nARS exposure, Citi also seeks\nto economically hedge the\nexposure to the extent\npossible and prudent using\nnon-deliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of September\n30, 2024, Citi hedged\napproximately $0.3 billion of\nits ARS exposure through\noffshore hedges, including NDF\nderivative instruments. Citi\nwas unable to hedge its\nremaining ARS exposure, given\nthe illiquidity of the\noffshore NDF market. To the\nextent that Citi is unable to\nexecute or renew NDF contracts\nin the future, Citi would\nrecord devaluations on its net\nARS-denominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of such derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposure. Citi\ncannot predict the\navailability of hedging\ninstruments in the future nor\ncan it predict changes in\nforeign exchange rates and the\nresulting impact on earnings.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished an appropriate ACL\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A portion of\nthese assets and liabilities\nis reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet as Trading account\nassets , Available-for-sale\nsecurities and Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\ndrivers to the valuation of an\ninstrument and the degree of\nilliquidity and subsequent\nlack of observability in\ncertain markets. The fair\nvalue of these instruments is\nreported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nwith the changes in fair value\nrecognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses, and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\ncredit losses are capped at\nthe difference between the\nfair value and amortized cost\nof the security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K.\n                               87                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below presents\nCiti\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\ntotal ACL as of the third\nquarter of 2024.

Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover a R&S timeframe. The R&S\nforecast period for all loans\nis eight quarters. The ACL is\ncomposed of quantitative and\nqualitative management\nadjustment components. The\nquantitative component uses\nthree forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects risks and\ncertain economic conditions\nnot fully captured in the\nquantitative component. Both\nthe quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\nQuantitative Component Citi\nestimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions. For its consumer\nand corporate portfolios,\nCiti\u2019s expected credit losses\nare determined primarily by\nutilizing models that consider\nthe borrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables, including housing\nprices, unemployment rate and\nreal GDP, and cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry,\nproduct and business segments.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well\nas other credit trends.\nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes\nrisks that are not fully\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent. These may include\nbut are not limited to\nportfolio characteristics,\nidiosyncratic events, factors\nnot within historical loss\ndata or the economic forecast,\nuncertainty in the credit\nenvironment and other factors\nas required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The primary examples of\nthese are the following:\n\n\u2022 Transfer risk associated\nwith exposures outside the\nU.S. for certain safety and\nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law \u2022 Potential\nimpacts on vulnerable\nindustries and regions due to\nemerging macroeconomic risks\nand uncertainties, including\nthose related to potential\nglobal recession, inflation,\ninterest rates, commodity\nprices and geopolitical\ntensions \u2022 Risk associated\nwith consumer payment behavior\ngiven the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment As of the third\nquarter of 2024, Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the\nACL increased quarter-over-\nquarter. The increase was\ndriven by factors such as\nincreases in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S. for safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law and\nmacroeconomic uncertainties,\npartially offset by a\nreduction in qualitative\nreserves associated with\nconsumer payment behavior\nrelated to the elevated\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment. Macroeconomic\nVariables As further discussed\nbelow, Citi considers a\nmultitude of global\nmacroeconomic variables for\nthe base, upside and downside\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe quantitative component of\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL. The\ntables below present Citi\u2019s\nforecasted quarterly average\nU.S. unemployment rate and\nyear-over-year U.S. real GDP\ngrowth rate used in\ndetermining the base\nmacroeconomic forecast for\nCiti\u2019s ACL for each quarterly\nreporting period from the\nthird quarter of 2023 to the\nthird quarter of 2024:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            4Q24       2Q25       4Q25       8-quart\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.4  %     4.3  %     4.3  %         4.2  %  \n  at 3Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.3        4.3        4.2            4.2     \n  at 4Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.1        4.1        4.0            4.0     \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.1        4.1        4.1            4.1     \n  at 2Q24                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.4        4.4        4.3            4.2     \n  at 3Q24                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking eight\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. real GDP                  2024       2025       2026     \n  Citi forecast                   1.0  %     2.0  %     2.4  %  \n  at 3Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.4        1.7        2.1     \n  at 4Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.3        1.8        2.0     \n  at 1Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.4        1.8        2.0     \n  at 2Q24                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.6        1.8        2.0     \n  at 3Q24                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level.\n                               89                               \nUnder the base macroeconomic\nforecast as of the third\nquarter of 2024, U.S. real GDP\ngrowth is expected to slow\nduring 2025, while the\nunemployment rate increases\ngradually into the first half\nof 2025 before gradually\ndeclining into 2026.\n\nScenario Weighting\n\nCiti\u2019s ACL is estimated using\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis.\n\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe base scenario. For\nexample, compared to the base\nscenario, Citi\u2019s downside\nscenario reflects a recession,\nincluding an elevated average\nU.S. unemployment rate of 6.8%\nover the eight-quarter R&S\nperiod, with a peak difference\nof 3.6% in the first quarter\nof 2026. The downside scenario\nalso reflects a year-over-year\nU.S. real GDP contraction in\n2025 of 2.2%, with a peak\nquarter-over-quarter\ndifference to the base\nscenario of 1.2%.\n\nCiti\u2019s ACL is sensitive to the\nvarious macroeconomic\nscenarios that drive the\nquantitative component of\nexpected credit losses, due to\nchanges in the length and\nseverity of forecasted\neconomic variables or events\nin the respective scenarios.\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe weighted scenario\nassumptions. To demonstrate\nthis sensitivity, if Citi\napplied 100% weight to the\ndownside scenario as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 to reflect\nthe most severe economic\ndeterioration forecast in the\nmacroeconomic scenarios, there\nwould have been a hypothetical\nincremental increase in the\nACL of approximately $5.3\nbillion related to lending\nexposures, except for loans\nindividually evaluated for\ncredit losses and other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost.\n\nThis analysis does not\nincorporate any impacts or\nchanges to the qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL. These\nfactors could change the\noutcome of the sensitivity\nanalysis based on historical\nexperience and current\nconditions at the time of the\nassessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of September\n30, 2024.\n\n3Q24 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for\nthe third quarter of 2024 was\n$22.1 billion, a slight\nincrease from June 30, 2024.\nThe net build of $0.5 billion\nin the quarter was primarily\ndriven by changes in portfolio\ncomposition in Banking and\nMarkets , an increase in\ntransfer risk associated with\nunremittable corporate\ndividends in Services and loan\ngrowth in USPB . Citi believes\nits analysis of the ACL\nreflects the forward view of\nthe economic environment as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. See Note\n15 for additional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. cards\n(Branded Cards and Retail\nServices) in USPB . Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACLL build was\n$0.1 billion in the third\nquarter of 2024, as a result\nof higher loan balances. This\nresulted in a September 30,\n2024 ACLL balance of $15.8\nbillion, or 4.05% of total\nfunded consumer loans.\n\nFor U.S. cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans increased\nslightly to 8.15% at September\n30, 2024, compared to 8.14% at\nJune 30, 2024. For the\nremaining consumer exposures,\nthe level of reserves relative\nto total funded loans was\n1.08% at September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 1.09% at June 30,\n2024.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nbuild of $0.1 billion in the\nthird quarter of 2024, largely\ndriven by changes in portfolio\ncomposition in Banking and\nMarkets. This resulted in a\nSeptember 30, 2024 ACLL\nbalance of $2.6 billion, or\n0.89% of total funded\ncorporate loans.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC build of\n$0.1 billion in the third\nquarter of 2024, largely\ndriven by changes in portfolio\ncomposition in Banking and\nMarkets . The ACLUC reserve\nbalance, included in Other\nliabilities , was $1.7 billion\nat September 30, 2024.\n                                                                \n  ACL on Other Financial Assets                                 \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACL build of $0.2\nbillion on other financial\nassets carried at amortized\ncost for the third quarter of\n2024, primarily due to an\nincrease in transfer risk\nassociated with unremittable\ncorporate dividends outside\nthe U.S. being held on behalf\nof clients, driven by safety\nand soundness considerations\nunder U.S. banking law.\nIncluding FX/Other, the ACL\nreserve balance of $2.0\nbillion remained unchanged\nfrom June 30, 2024. See Note\n15 for additional information.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti elected the modified CECL\ntransition provision for\nregulatory capital purposes\nprovided by the U.S. banking\nagencies\u2019 final rule.\nAccordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from the adoption of\nCECL, as well as the ongoing\nadjustments for 25% of the\nchange in CECL-based\nallowances in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021, started to\nbe phased in on January 1,\n2022 and will be fully\nreflected in Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital as of January 1, 2025.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 15 for a\nfurther description of the ACL\nand related accounts.\n                               90                               \nGoodwill Citi tests for\ngoodwill impairment annually\nas of October 1 (the annual\ntest) and conducts interim\nassessments between annual\ntests if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that\nwould more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its\ncarrying amount. These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsustained decrease in Citi\u2019s\nstock price. The impairment\ntests performed in the fourth\nquarter of 2023 resulted in\nthe fair values of Citi\u2019s\nreporting units exceeding\ntheir carrying values for all\nreporting units. Additionally,\nthe tests results showed that\nthe fair value of the Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM reporting unit\nas a percentage of its\ncarrying value was 106%, with\nthe carrying value including\napproximately $1.1 billion of\ngoodwill. For each of the\nremaining reporting units,\nfair value exceeded carrying\nvalue by at least 10%. While\nthe inherent risk related to\nuncertainty is embedded in the\nkey assumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as Citi\u2019s management\nexecutes on its transformation\nand strategy. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key\neconomic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture.

The\ndecrease quarter-over-quarter\nwas primarily from unrealized\ngains in Other comprehensive\nincome and the year-to-date\nincrease was primarily a\nresult of Citi\u2019s geographic\nmix of earnings. Of Citi\u2019s\n$30.0 billion of net DTAs,\n$12.8 billion (compared to\n$13.6 billion at June 30,\n2024) was deducted in\ncalculating Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital, and the remaining\n$17.2 billion was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder the Basel III rules. The\n$12.8 billion of DTAs deducted\nfrom regulatory capital was\ncomposed of $11.3 billion\nrelated to tax carry-forwards,\nwith $3.1 billion of temporary\ndifferences in excess of the\n10%/15% regulatory\nlimitations, reduced by $1.6\nbillion of deferred tax\nliabilities, primarily\nassociated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible\nassets that were separately\ndeducted from capital. DTA\nRealizability Citi believes\nthat realization of the net\nDTAs of $30.0 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024 is more-\nlikely-than-not, based on\nmanagement\u2019s expectations of\nfuture taxable income\ngeneration in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\nconsideration of available tax\nplanning strategies (as\ndefined in ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes ).\n                               91                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. Based on\nthat evaluation, the CEO and\nCFO have concluded that at\nthat date Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective.\n\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION\n219 OF THE IRAN THREAT\nREDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN\nRIGHTS ACT\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the\nIran Threat Reduction and\nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012\n(Section 219), which added\nSection 13(r) to the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, Citi is\nrequired to disclose in its\nannual or quarterly reports,\nas applicable, whether it or\nany of its affiliates\nknowingly engaged in certain\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings relating to Iran or\nwith certain individuals or\nentities that are the subject\nof sanctions under U.S. law.\nDisclosure may be required\neven where the activities,\ntransactions or dealings were\nconducted in compliance with\napplicable law.

Upon adoption,\nCiti transferred $ 3.3billion of mortgage-backed securities from\nHTM classification to AFS classification as allowed under the\nASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an\nunrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion, which was recorded in\nAOCI upon transfer.\n\n(5) Operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities represent non-cash investing and financing\nactivities, respectively, and are not included in the non-cash\ninvesting activities presented here.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND\nACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include the\naccounts of Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. In\nthe opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal\nrecurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation have\nbeen reflected. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be read in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related notes included\nwithin Citigroup\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K), Citigroup\u2019s Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (First Quarter\nof 2024 Form 10-Q) and Citigroup\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (Second Quarter of 2024 Form\n10-Q). Certain financial information that is normally included\nin annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but is not\nrequired for interim reporting purposes, has been condensed or\nomitted. Management must make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related\nfootnote disclosures. While management uses its best judgment,\nactual results could differ from those estimates. As noted\nabove, the Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements are\nunaudited. Throughout these Notes, \u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup Inc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain reclassifications and updates have been\nmade to the prior periods\u2019 financial statements and notes to\nconform to the current period\u2019s presentation. Cash equivalents\nare defined as those amounts included in Cash and due from banks\nand predominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from\nrisk management activities are classified in the same category\nas the related assets and liabilities. Amounts included in Cash\nand due from banks and Deposits with banks approximate fair\nvalue.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities\nSubject to Contractual Sale Restrictions In June 2022, the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting\nStandards Update (ASU) No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement\n(Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject\nto Contractual Sale Restrictions . The ASU was issued to address\ndiversity in practice whereby certain entities included the\nimpact of contractual restrictions when valuing equity\nsecurities, and it clarifies that a contractual restriction on\nthe sale of an equity security should not be considered part of\nthe unit of account of the equity security and, therefore,\nshould not be considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also\nincludes requirements for entities to disclose the fair value of\nequity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the\nnature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the\ncircumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions. Citi\nadopted the ASU on January 1, 2024, which did not impact the\nfinancial statements of the Company. Accounting for Investments\nin Tax Credit Structures In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023\u201002, Investments\u2014Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic\n323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using\nthe Proportional Amortization Method . The ASU expanded the\nscope of tax equity investments eligible to apply the\nproportional amortization method of accounting. Under the\nproportional amortization method, the cost of an eligible\ninvestment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits\nand other income tax benefits that are received by the investor,\nwith the amortization of the investment and the income tax\ncredits being presented net in the income statement as\ncomponents of income tax expense (benefit). The ASU permits the\nCompany to elect to use the proportional amortization method to\naccount for an expanded range of eligible tax-incentivized\ninvestments if certain conditions are met. Citi adopted the ASU\non January 1, 2024, which did not have a material impact to the\nfinancial statements of the Company. See Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of 2023 accounting changes.\n                              106                               \nFUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES Disaggregation of Income Statement\nExpenses In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03,\nIncome Statement\u2014Reporting Comprehensive Income\u2014Expense\nDisaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) , to improve the\ndisclosures of expenses by requiring public business entities to\nprovide further disaggregation of relevant expense captions\n(i.e., employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset\namortization) in a separate note to the financial statements, a\nqualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant\nexpense captions that are not separately disaggregated\nquantitatively, and the total amount of selling expenses and, in\nan annual reporting period, an entity\u2019s definition of selling\nexpenses. The ASU is required to be adopted on a retrospective\nor prospective basis and will be effective for Citi for its\nannual period ending December 31, 2027 and interim periods for\nthe interim period beginning January 1, 2028. Citi is currently\nevaluating the impact on its disclosures. Accounting for and\nDisclosure of Crypto Assets In December 2023, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2023-08, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other\u2014Crypto Assets\n(Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto\nAssets , intended to improve the accounting for certain crypto\nassets by requiring an entity to measure those assets at fair\nvalue each reporting period, with changes in fair value\nrecognized in net income. The amendments also improve the\ninformation provided to investors about an entity\u2019s crypto asset\nholdings by requiring disclosure about significant holdings,\ncontractual sale restrictions and changes during the reporting\nperiod. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, and interim periods within those fiscal\nyears with early adoption permitted. Citi does not hold any\ncrypto assets within the scope of the guidance. Income Taxes\n(Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures In December\n2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures , intended to enhance the\ntransparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures.\nThis guidance requires that public business entities disclose on\nan annual basis a tabular rate reconciliation in eight specific\ncategories disaggregated by nature and for foreign tax effects\nby jurisdiction that meet a 5% of pretax income multiplied by\nthe applicable statutory tax rate or greater threshold annually.\nThe eight categories include state and local income taxes, net\nof federal income tax effect; foreign tax effects; enactment of\nnew tax laws; enactment of new tax credits; effect of cross-\nborder tax laws; valuation allowances; nontaxable items and\nnondeductible items; and changes in unrecognized tax benefits.\nAdditional disclosures include qualitative description of the\nstate and local jurisdictions that contribute to the majority\n(greater than 50%) of the effect of the state and local income\ntax category and explanation of the nature and effect of changes\nin individual reconciling items. The guidance also requires\nentities annually to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds\nreceived) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and\nby jurisdiction identified based on the same 5% quantitative\nthreshold. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024. The transition method is prospective\nwith the retrospective method permitted. Citi plans to adopt the\nASU for the annual reporting period beginning on January 1,\n2025, and is currently evaluating the impact on disclosures.\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures , intended to improve reportable\nsegments disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU includes\na requirement to disclose significant segment expenses that are\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM)\nand included within each reported measure of segment profit or\nloss, the title and position of the CODM, an explanation of how\nthe CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss\nin assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate\nresources, and all segments\u2019 profit or loss and assets\ndisclosures currently required annually by Topic 280 along with\nthose introduced by the ASU to be reported on an interim basis.\nThe amendments also clarified that public entities are not\nprecluded from reporting additional measures of a segment\u2019s\nprofit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM. Citi plans\nto adopt the ASU on a retrospective basis for its annual period\nending December 31, 2024 and for the interim period beginning\nJanuary 1, 2025.\n                              107                               \n2.

Citi is organized into fivereportable operating\nsegments: Services , Markets , Banking , U.S. Personal Banking\n(USPB) and Wealth , with the remaining operations recorded in\nAll Other , which includes activities not assigned to a specific\nreportable operating segment, as well as discontinued\noperations. See operating segment details in Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Citi reallocated certain\ndeposit balances from Markets to All Other , to consolidate\nfunding strategies across the Company. This change had no\nmaterial impact to operating results of Markets or All Other.\nPrior periods were not reclassified and Citi\u2019s consolidated\nresults remained unchanged for all periods presented. During the\nsecond quarter of 2024, Citi realigned businesses engaged in\nfinancing and securitization activities within Banking and\nMarkets , transferred the retail banking business in the U.K.,\nwhich is being wound down, from Wealth to All Other and made\nother immaterial reclassifications to align with Citi\u2019s\ntransformation and strategy. These reclassifications did not\nmaterially change segment or All Other results, and prior\nperiods were conformed to reflect these changes. Citi\u2019s\nconsolidated results remain unchanged for all periods presented.\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2024, Citi reallocated certain\ncustomer balances between All Other\u2014 Legacy Franchises, Services\n, Markets and Banking in preparation for the IPO of the Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM operations, and made other immaterial\nreclassifications. These reallocations and reclassifications did\nnot materially change segment or All Other results and prior\nperiods were conformed to reflect these changes. Citi\u2019s\nconsolidated results remain unchanged for all periods presented.\nRevenues and expenses directly associated with each respective\nbusiness segment or component are included in determining\nrespective operating results. Other revenues and expenses that\nare attributable to a particular business segment or component\nare generally allocated from All Other based on respective net\nrevenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.\nRevenues and expenses from transactions with other operating\nsegments or components are treated as transactions with external\nparties for purposes of segment disclosures, while funding\ncharges paid by operating segments and funding credits received\nby Corporate Treasury within All Other are included in net\ninterest income. The Company includes intersegment eliminations\nwithin All Other to reconcile the operating segment results to\nCiti\u2019s consolidated results. The accounting policies of these\nreportable operating segments are the same as those disclosed in\nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023\nForm 10-K.\n                              110                               \nThe following tables present certain information regarding the\nCompany\u2019s continuing operations by reportable operating segments\nand All Other on a managed basis that excludes divestiture-\nrelated impacts.

Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump-sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n                              118                               \nThe following table presents the change in AOCI related to the\nCompany\u2019s pension, postretirement and post employment plans:\n                                                                \n                Three          Nine        Three          Nine  \n               Months        Months       Months        Months  \n  In\u00a0           Ended         Ended        Ended         Ended  \n  milli\u2026       Septe\u2026       Septem\u2026       Septe\u2026       Septem\u2026  \n  of\u00a0             30,           30,          30,           30,  \n  dolla\u2026         2024          2024         2023          2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Begin\u2026                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  period    $  -5,794    $   -6,050    $  -5,995    $   -5,755  \n  balan\u2026                                                        \n  net of                                                        \n  tax(1\u2026                                                        \n  Actua\u2026                                                        \n  assum\u2026                                                        \n  chang\u2026         -458            78          818           703  \n  and                                                           \n  plan                                                          \n  exper\u2026                                                        \n  Net                                                           \n  gain                                                          \n  (loss)                                                        \n  due to                                                        \n  diffe\u2026          466           -10         -614          -676  \n  betwe\u2026                                                        \n  actual                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  expec\u2026                                                        \n  retur\u2026                                                        \n  Net              56           181           47           135  \n  amort\u2026                                                        \n  Curta\u2026            4             8            5             1  \n  loss                                                          \n  Forei\u2026                                                        \n  excha\u2026                                                        \n  impact           20           148          124           -95  \n  and                                                           \n  other                                                         \n  Change                                                        \n  in                                                            \n  defer\u2026          -39          -100          -68             4  \n  taxes,                                                        \n  net                                                           \n  Chang\u2026                                                        \n  net of    $      49    $      305    $     312    $       72  \n  tax                                                           \n  End of                                                        \n  period                                                        \n  balan\u2026    $  -5,745    $   -5,745    $  -5,683    $   -5,683  \n  net of                                                        \n  tax(1\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 19 for further discussion of net AOCI balance.\n(2) Includes net of tax amounts for certain profit-sharing plans\noutside the U.S.\nPlan Assumptions\nCertain assumptions used in determining pension and\npostretirement benefit obligations and net expense (benefit) for\nthe Company\u2019s Significant Plans are presented in the following\ntables:\n                                                                \n  During                                                        \n  the                                                           \n  period          Three                                         \n  Sept.

For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value\noption, as described in Notes 23 and 24. The remaining portion\nis carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 24. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

typically issued by VIEs through\nsecuritization transactions. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the\nsecurities, which is reflected in the table above.

Upon adoption,\nCiti transferred $ 3.3billion of mortgage-backed securities from\nHTM classification to AFS classification as allowed under the\nASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an\nunrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion, which was recorded in\nAOCI upon transfer .

Gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized (losses) on\nmortgage-backed securities excluding the effect of unallocated\nportfolio layer hedges cumulative basis adjustments were $\n0.4billion and $( 0.5) billion, respectively, as of September\n30, 2024.\n                              128                               \nThe following table presents the fair value of AFS debt\nsecurities that have

Company invests in mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecurities. These securitizations are generally considered VIEs.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal\nto the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in\nthe table above. See Note 21 for mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecuritizations in which the Company has other involvement.\n(3) In January 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-01.

Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired. For\ndetails on impairment\nindicators that are\nconsidered, see Note 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K.

loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest and/or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(4) The Total loans column includes loans at fair value, which\nare not included in the various delinquency columns and,\ntherefore, the

Citi defines a corporate loan modification to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty as a modification of\na loan classified as substandard or worse at the time of\nmodification.\n

Citi uses various\nmetrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the\ntime of modification. Citi\u2019s significant consumer modification\nprograms are described below. Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist\ncredit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty\nby offering long-term loan modification programs. These\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan\nnot to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer\u2019s available\nline of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card\nborrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nseek to restructure customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In both\ncircumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nstandard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may\nforgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays\na required amount. Residential Mortgages Citi utilizes a third-\nparty subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage\nloans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to\nassist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate\nreductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term\nextensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in\nforbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the\nend of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently\nmodifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi\nenters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a three-monthperiod during\nwhich the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated\nmodified payment terms.

See Note 3 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\n(2) Goodwill allocated to the global fiduciary and trust\nadministration services business was classified as HFS during\nthe third quarter of 2024.\nCiti tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the\nannual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual\ntest if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-\nlikely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below\nits carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were\nidentified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. For additional information regarding Citi\u2019s\ngoodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 17 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form 10-K.\nWhile the inherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the key\nassumptions used in the reporting unit valuations, the economic\nand business environments continue to evolve as management\nexecutes on its transformation and strategy. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key economic and market assumptions were to\ndiffer from its current assumptions, Citi could potentially\nexperience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.\n\nIntangible Assets\nThe components of intangible assets were as follows:\n                                                                \n           Se\u2026

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions\nwas $ 7.3billion and $ 8.5billion, respectively (see Note 14 and\nNote 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023\nForm 10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which\nthe Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments\nare made on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage-\nand asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and\n22 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              172                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets\ninclude those assets that can only be used to settle obligations\nof consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those obligations. In\naddition, the assets include third-party assets of consolidated\nVIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in\nconsolidation. The liabilities include third-party liabilities\nof consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that\neliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts\nwhere creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to\nthe general credit of Citigroup.\n

Citi did not transfer\nnon-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization\nentities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023. These securities are backed by either residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of\nclients. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Citi\nheld noretained interests in private label re-securitization\ntransactions structured by Citi. The Company also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency)\nsecurities. During the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of\napproximately $ 6.3billion and $ 17.0billion to re-\nsecuritization entities, compared to approximately $ 4.3billion\nand $ 12.8billion for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value\nof Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization\ntransactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $\n2.3billion (including $ 1.5billion related to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2024), compared to $ 1.7billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (including $ 930million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions executed in 2023), which is recorded\nin Trading account assets . The original fair values of agency\nre-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were\napproximately $ 79.0billion and $ 84.1billion, respectively. As\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not\nconsolidate any private label or agency re-securitization\nentities. Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper\nConduits At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\ncommercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately\n$ 20.3billion and $ 21.1billion of purchased assets outstanding,\nand unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $\n18.7billion and $ 16.7billion, respectively. Substantially all\nof the funding of the conduits is in the form of short-term\ncommercial paper. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe weighted-average remaining maturities of the commercial\npaper issued by the conduits were approximately 63and 68days,\nrespectively. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured\nwith transaction-specific credit enhancements, including over-\ncollateralization, cash and excess spread collateral accounts,\ndirect recourse or third-party guarantees. Each credit\nenhancement is sized with the objective of approximating an\ninvestment-grade credit rating, based on Citi\u2019s internal risk\nratings. In addition to the transaction-specific credit\nenhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit from\nthe Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit\u2019s\nassets with a minimum of $ 200million to $ 350million. The\nletters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total\napproximately $ 2.1billion and $ 2.1billion as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The net result across\nmulti-seller conduits administered by the Company is that, in\nthe event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit\nare allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial\npaper investors.

All derivatives are\nrecorded in Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note\n24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining to Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table\nbelow. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from\nwhich contractual payments are derived and do not represent a\ncomplete measure of Citi\u2019s exposure to derivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure arises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market\nvaluation adjustments that may be required on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts presented below do not reflect the\nnetting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and\noffsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed\nposition with a different counterparty, $200 million in\nderivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting\npositions may result in de minimis overall market risk. In\naddition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate\nfrom period to period in the normal course of business based on\nCiti\u2019s market share, levels of client activity and other\nfactors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n                                                                \n               Hedgi\u2026                                           \n

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk, and as a market-maker to facilitate client\ntransactions.\n                              179                               \nThe following tables present the gross and net fair values of\nthe Company\u2019s derivative transactions and the related offsetting\namounts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Gross\npositive fair values are offset against gross negative fair\nvalues by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in\nrespect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given\ncounterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in\nthe offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security\ncollateral. In addition, the following tables reflect rule\nchanges adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow\nentities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as settlement of the related derivative\nfair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to\npresenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are\nsubject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables\nalso present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the\nCompany\u2019s balance sheet presentation, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians,\nbut which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an\nevent of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              180                               \nDerivative Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables\n

These cash flow hedging relationships\nuse either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis\nto assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective\nat inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe pretax change in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented\nbelow:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026               \u2026                                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $          \u2026    $          \u2026    $             $           \n                 \u2026               \u2026                              \n      $          \u2026    $          \u2026    $             $           \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n                 \u2026               \u2026                              \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n              $  \u2026            $  \u2026           $             $    \n                                                                \n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate\ncontracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net\ninterest income) .

      \nCredit Risk-Related Contingent\nFeatures in Derivatives\nCertain derivative instruments\ncontain provisions that\nrequire the Company to either\npost additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 was $\n14billion and $ 15billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 12billion and $\n12billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023,\nrespectively. A downgrade\ncould trigger additional\ncollateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company\nand certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and\nCitibank were downgraded a\nsingle notch by all threemajor\nrating agencies as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n0.2billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 16million upon the single\nnotch downgrade, resulting in\naggregate cash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $ 0.2billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n5.5billion and $ 4.3billion as\nof September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023,\nrespectively. At September 30,\n2024, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 5.3billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of September 30, 2024\nwas $ 168million recorded as\ngross derivative assets and $\n31million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n4.3billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 121million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n29million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              188                               \n23. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For\nadditional information\nregarding fair value\nmeasurement at Citi, see Note\n26 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2023 Form 10-K. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nvalue drivers are observable\nin the market. \u2022 Level 3:\nValuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which\none or more significant inputs\nor value drivers are\nunobservable . As required\nunder the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data-driven criteria to\ndetermine whether an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022\nThe determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based on the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nThe table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments\n(CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) applied to the\nfair value of derivative instruments (recorded in Trading\naccount assets and Trading account liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet) at September

The\nLevel 3 to Level 2 YTD\ntransfers were primarily the\nresult of enhanced\nsignificance testing of\nunobservable input for certain\nstructured debt instruments.\nThe Level 2 to Level 3 YTD\ntransfers were primarily the\nresult of certain unobservable\ninputs becoming more\nsignificant to the overall\nvaluation of these\ninstruments.\n\nThe following were the\nsignificant Level 3 transfers\nfor the period December 31,\n2022 to September 30, 2023:\n\n\u2022 During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30,\n2023, transfers of Long-term\ndebt were $ 1.0billion and $\n4.2billion from Level 2 to\nLevel 3, respectively. Of the\n$ 4.2billion transfer,\napproximately $ 3.6billion\nrelated to interest rate\noption volatility inputs\nbecoming unobservable and/or\nsignificant relative to their\noverall valuation, and $\n0.6billion related to equity\nand credit derivative inputs\n(in addition to other\nvolatility inputs, e.g.,\ninterest rate volatility\ninputs) becoming unobservable\nand/or significant to their\noverall valuation. In other\ninstances, market changes have\nresulted in some inputs\nbecoming more observable, and\nsome unobservable inputs\nbecoming less significant to\nthe overall valuation of the\ninstruments (e.g., when an\noption becomes deep-in or\ndeep-out of the money). This\nhas primarily resulted in $\n1.3billion and $ 7.4billion of\ncertain structured long-term\ndebt products being\ntransferred from Level 3 to\nLevel 2 during the three and\nnine months ended September\n30, 2023, respectively.\n                              202                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements The following tables present the valuation\ntechniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the\nmost significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements.

Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 19\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss\nof $( 201) million and a gain of $ 395million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and a loss of $( 608)\nmillion and $( 875) million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting\nfrom changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated\nby incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads observable\nin the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to\nvalue each liability as described above. The Fair Value Option\nfor Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Selected\nPortfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell,\nSecurities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the U.S., the U.K. and\nJapan. In each case, the election was made because the related\ninterest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily\nwith offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at\nfair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for\ntransactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal\ntransactions . The related interest income and interest expense\nare measured based on the contractual rates specified in the\ntransactions and are reported as Interest income and Interest\nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans\nand Other Credit Products Citigroup has also elected the fair\nvalue option for certain other originated and purchased loans,\nincluding certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and\nletters of credit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading\nbusinesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged\nfinancing commitments. Significant groups of transactions\ninclude loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be\neither sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions\nwhere the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments,\nsuch as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps\nwhere the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans\nto a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to\nmitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting\nis complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair\nvalue was not elected for most lending transactions across the\nCompany.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                Septem\u2026                                         \n                    30,                   December              \n                   2024                   31, 2023              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026       Trading       Loans        Trading       Loans  \n  of             assets                     assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $    4,059    $  8,106    $     4,518    $  7,594  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess            109         -71             88          10  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans               \u2014           2              \u2014           1  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value               \u2014           1              \u2014           1  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 280million and $\n391million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n                              210                               \nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest income is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nincome on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 due to instrument-specific credit risk were a gain\nof $ 6million and a loss of $( 27) million, respectively.\nChanges in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are\nestimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads\nand recovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of\nits commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment\nis bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the contract within\nTrading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades\nunallocated precious metals investments and executes forward\npurchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading\ncounterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals\ninvestment, Citi\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid\nand Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious\nmetal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. Certain\nMortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS) Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option for certain purchased and originated prime\nfixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans\nHFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are\neconomically hedged with derivative instruments.

                                             \n(1) The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n(2) At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be approximately $\n124billion and $ 138billion, respectively. However, Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of the\nactual potential loss exposure based on its historical\nexperience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as\nmost products and services are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.\n                              213                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse In addition to the amounts presented in\nthe tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $\n12million and $ 11million at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Futures and Over-\nthe-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services\non central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of\nnon-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post\nvariation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of\nthe client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of non-\nperformance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event\nthat the client fails to perform. Carrying Value\u2014Guarantees and\nIndemnifications At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the\nguarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above\namounted to approximately $ 1.0billion and $ 1.2billion,\nrespectively. The carrying value of financial and performance\nguarantees is included in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash\ncollateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under\nthese guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 53.5billion\nand $ 52.5billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 71.3billion and $ 67.7billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The\nmajority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized\nunder securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters\nof credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $\n3.2billion and $ 3.1billion at September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively. Other property may also be available to\nCiti to cover losses under certain guarantees and\nindemnifications; however, the value of such property has not\nbeen determined.\n\nPerformance Risk\nPresented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts\nof future payments that are classified based on internal and\nexternal credit ratings. The determination of the maximum\npotential future payments is based on the notional amount of the\nguarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged.

Such fees (net of certain\ndirect costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the commitment period.\nThe table below summarizes Citigroup\u2019s credit commitments:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0                                                           \n  milli\u2026                     Outsi\u2026       Septem\u2026       Decem\u2026  \n  of\u00a0                            of           30,          31,  \n  dolla\u2026          U.S.       U.S.(\u2026          2024         2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  simil\u2026    $      779    $   3,349    $    4,128    $   5,345  \n  lette\u2026                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  credit                                                        \n  One-                                                          \n  to                                                            \n  four-\u2026           592          499         1,091        1,245  \n  resid\u2026                                                        \n  mortg\u2026                                                        \n  Revol\u2026                                                        \n  open-\u2026                                                        \n  loans                                                         \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  by             5,287           16         5,303        5,495  \n  one-                                                          \n  to                                                            \n  four-\u2026                                                        \n  resid\u2026                                                        \n  prope\u2026                                                        \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  real                                                          \n  estat\u2026                                                        \n  const\u2026        11,458        1,629        13,087       15,266  \n  and                                                           \n  land                                                          \n  devel\u2026                                                        \n  Credit                                                        \n  card         621,106       61,276       682,382       677,0\u2026  \n  lines                                                         \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and                                                           \n  other        225,558       112,1\u2026       337,744       312,3\u2026  \n  consu\u2026                                                        \n  loan                                                          \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n  Other                                                         \n  commi\u2026         4,911          201         5,112        5,146  \n  and                                                           \n  conti\u2026                                                        \n  Total     $  869,691    $  179,1\u2026    $  1,048,\u2026    $  1,021\u2026  \n                                                                \n(1) Consumer commitments related to the business HFS countries\nunder sales agreements are reflected in their original\ncategories until the respective sales are completed.\n(2) Other commitments and contingencies include commitments to\npurchase certain debt and equity securities.\nOther Commitments As a Federal\nReserve member bank, Citi is\nrequired to subscribe to half\nof a certain amount of shares\nissued by its Federal Reserve\nDistrict Bank.

CONTINGENCIES                                             \n                                                                \nThe following information\nsupplements and amends, as\napplicable, the disclosures in\nNote 27 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements of\nCitigroup\u2019s Second Quarter of\n2024 Form 10-Q, Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements of Citigroup\u2019s\nFirst Quarter of 2024 Form\n10-Q and Note 30 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K. For purposes of this\nNote, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory, or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. With\nrespect to previously incurred\nloss contingencies for which\nrecovery is expected, Citi\napplies loss recovery\naccounting when disputes and\nuncertainties affecting\nrecognition are resolved. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At September 30,\n2024, Citigroup estimates that\nthe reasonably possible\nunaccrued loss for these\nmatters ranges up to\napproximately $ 1.3billion in\nthe aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is\nable to estimate will change,\nand the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition,\nwhile many estimates presented\nin financial statements and\nother financial disclosures\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of\nreasonably possible loss\narising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued in\nrelation to matters for which\nan estimate has been made\ncould be substantially higher\nor lower than the range of\nloss included in the estimate.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters\ndescribed in this Note would\nnot be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters\ncould, from time to time, have\na material adverse effect on\nCitigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash\nflows in particular quarterly\nor annual periods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 30 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2023 Form\n10-K.
