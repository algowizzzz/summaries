2022\u2014Results\nDemonstrated Continued\nProgress Across the Franchise\n\nAs described further\nthroughout this Executive\nSummary, during the first\nquarter of 2022:\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s revenues declined 2%\nversus the prior-year period,\nas higher net interest\nincome\u2014driven by Services, in\nInstitutional Clients Group\n(ICG) , and Personal Banking\nand Wealth Management (PBWM)\n\u2014was more than offset by lower\nnon-interest revenue across\nbusinesses.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to invest in\nits risk and control\nenvironment, modernize its\nsystems and technology\ninfrastructure and make\nbusiness-led investments,\nwhich include attracting front\noffice talent, developing\nintegrated solutions and\nenhancing product capabilities\nthat improve the digital\nclient experience and add\nscalability.\n\n\u2022 Citi had a modest allowance\nfor credit losses (ACL)\nrelease in the quarter that\nincluded a build of\napproximately $1.9 billion\nrelated to Citi\u2019s exposures in\nRussia and the impact of the\nwar in Ukraine on the broader\nmacroeconomic environment (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cCost of Credit\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 Citi had solid year-over-\nyear loan and deposit growth\nacross ICG and PBWM ,\nreflecting continued\nengagement across both\ncorporate clients and\nconsumers.\n\n\u2022 Citi repurchased\napproximately 50 million\ncommon shares and returned\napproximately $4 billion of\ncapital to common shareholders\nin the form of repurchases and\ndividends.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to make\nprogress with its refresh\nstrategy, including entering\ninto sale agreements for an\nadditional seven consumer\nbanking franchises in Asia and\nEMEA, for a total of 9 of 14\nexit markets signed and\nannounced, with a clear wind-\ndown path for Korea.\n\nVarious geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic challenges\nrelated to, among other\nthings, the war in Ukraine,\ndisruptions of global supply\nchains, inflationary pressures\nand higher interest rates will\ncontinue to create\nuncertainties around economic\nconditions in the U.S. and\nglobally, and consequently for\nCiti\u2019s businesses and future\nresults.

The decrease in net\nincome was\n\ndriven by higher cost of\ncredit, higher expenses and\nlower revenues. Citigroup\u2019s\neffective tax rate was 18%\nversus 23% in the prior-year\nperiod, reflecting the\nresolution of certain tax\naudit items. Earnings per\nshare decreased 44%,\nreflecting the decrease in net\nincome, partially offset by a\n6% decline in shares\noutstanding.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $19.2\nbillion decreased 2%, as\nhigher net interest income\ndriven by ICG and PBWM was\nmore than offset by lower non-\ninterest revenue across\nbusinesses.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $660 billion, down\n1% from the prior-year period,\nas growth in ICG and PBWM (up\n6% and 4%, respectively) was\nmore than offset by lower\nloans in Legacy Franchises ,\nprimarily reflecting the\nreclassification of loans to\nOther assets to reflect held-\nfor-sale accounting as a\nresult of the signing of sale\nagreements for consumer\nfranchises in Asia and EMEA.\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits increased 3% to $1.3\ntrillion, driven by increases\nin both PBWM and ICG .\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup operating expenses\nof $13.2 billion increased\n15%. Citigroup\u2019s expenses\nincluded Asia Consumer\ndivestiture-related costs\nlargely related to a goodwill\nwrite-down of approximately\n$535 million (approximately\n$489 million after-tax) due to\nthe re-segmentation and timing\nof divestitures. These Asia\nConsumer divestiture-related\ncosts were recorded in Legacy\nFranchises . Excluding the\nAsia Consumer divestiture-\nrelated costs, operating\nexpenses increased 10%, driven\nby continued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation,\nbusiness-led investments and\nvolume-related expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings (as used\nthroughout this Form 10-Q,\nCiti\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition\nexcluding the impact of the\nAsia Consumer divestiture-\nrelated costs are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures).\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $0.8\nbillion, compared to a benefit\nof $2.1 billion in the prior-\nyear period. The higher cost\nof credit was driven by a\nlower ACL release ($0.1\nbillion versus $3.9 billion in\nthe prior-year period),\npartially offset by lower net\ncredit losses.\n\nThe net ACL release included a\n$1.9 billion ACL build,\nconsisting of approximately $1\nbillion related to Citi\u2019s\nexposures in Russia and\napproximately $900 million\nrelated to the impact of the\nwar in Ukraine on the broader\nglobal macroeconomic\nenvironment. This build was\nmore than offset by an ACL\nrelease related to a COVID-19\nuncertainty reserve, primarily\nin U.S. Personal Banking.

Corporate\nnet credit losses decreased\n83% to $31 million, from $185\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by improvements\nin portfolio credit quality.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) Capital ratio was\n11.4% as of March 31, 2022,\nbased on the Basel III\nStandardized Approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets, compared to 11.6% as\nof March 31, 2021, based on\nthe Basel III Advanced\nApproaches for determining\nrisk-weighted assets. The\ndecrease primarily reflected\nthe return of capital to\nshareholders and the adverse\nnet movements in the\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (AOCI)\ncomponent of equity, partially\noffset by net income.\nAdditionally, the change in\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nreflected a change in Citi\u2019s\nbinding constraint from the\nAdvanced Approaches to the\nStandardized Approach,\ninclusive of the impact of\nadopting the Standardized\nApproach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk (SA-CCR) on\nJanuary 1, 2022. For\nadditional information on SA-\nCCR, see \u201cCapital Resources\u201d\nbelow.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of March 31,\n2022 was 5.6%, compared to\n6.9% as of March 31, 2021. The\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby an increase in Total\nLeverage Exposure, reflecting\nthe expiration of temporary\nrelief granted by the Federal\nReserve Board. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s capital\nratios and related components,\nsee \u201cCapital Resources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Institutional Clients Group                                   \n                                                                \nICG net income of $2.6 billion\ndecreased 51%, primarily\ndriven by higher expenses,\nhigher cost of credit and\nslightly lower revenues. ICG\noperating expenses increased\n13% to $6.7 billion,\nreflecting continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and volume-related\nexpenses, partially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nICG revenues of $11.2 billion\ndecreased 2%, largely driven\nby Banking, partially offset\nby an increase in Services\nrevenue.\n\nServices revenues of $3.4\nbillion increased 15%,\nprimarily from TTS revenues of\n$2.6 billion, which increased\n18%, driven by net interest\nincome on higher deposit\nbalances and spreads as well\nas strong fee growth.\nSecurities services revenues\nof $858 million increased 6%,\nas net interest income grew\n17%, driven by higher interest\nrates across currencies, and\nfee revenues grew 2%, due to\nhigher assets under custody.\n\nMarkets revenues of $5.8\nbillion were down 2%, versus a\nvery strong quarter in the\nprior-year period. In the\ncurrent quarter, activity\nlevels benefited from client\nrepositioning and strong risk\nmanagement, driven by the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s interest\nrate increases and overall\ngeopolitical and macroeconomic\nuncertainty. Fixed income\nmarkets revenues of $4.3\nbillion decreased 1%, as\nstrong client engagement in\nFX, commodities and rates was\noffset by less activity in\nspread products. Equity\nmarkets revenues of $1.5\nbillion were down 4%, compared\nto a very strong quarter in\nthe prior-year\n\nperiod, reflecting strong\nequity derivatives performance\nand growth in prime finance\nbalances.\n\nBanking revenues of $1.9\nbillion decreased 23%,\nincluding the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges. Excluding the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges,\nBanking revenues decreased 32%\nversus the prior-year period,\nas heightened geopolitical\nuncertainty and the overall\nmacroeconomic backdrop reduced\nactivity in debt and equity\ncapital markets. Investment\nbanking revenues decreased 43%\ndue to lower capital markets\nactivity, partially offset by\ngrowth in advisory. Corporate\nlending revenues of $689\nmillion decreased 6%\n(excluding gain (loss) on loan\nhedges), primarily driven by\nlower average loans.

PBWM\noperating expenses of $3.9\nbillion increased 14%, driven\nby transformation and\nbusiness-led investments, and\nhigher volume-driven expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nPBWM revenues of $5.9 billion\ndecreased 1%, as higher net\ninterest income was more than\noffset by lower non-interest\nrevenue.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nof $4.0 billion decreased 1%,\nwith lower revenues across\nBranded cards and Retail\nbanking. Branded cards\nrevenues of $2.1 billion\ndecreased 1%, due to higher\npayment rates and higher\nacquisition and rewards costs,\nreflecting increases in new\naccounts and customer\nengagement. Retail services\nrevenues of $1.3 billion were\nlargely unchanged, as higher\nnet interest income was offset\nby higher partner payments,\ndriven by lower net credit\nlosses. Retail banking\nrevenues of $595 million\ndecreased 6%, largely driven\nby lower mortgage\noriginations.\n\nGlobal Wealth Management\nrevenues of $1.9 billion\ndecreased 1%, primarily due to\nlower client activity in\ninvestments, particularly in\nAsia.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nPBWM for the first quarter of\n2022, see \u201c Personal Banking\nand Wealth Management \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Legacy Franchises                                             \n                                                                \nLegacy Franchises net loss was\n$383 million, compared to net\nincome of $323 million in the\nprior-year period, reflecting\nlower revenues, higher\nexpenses and higher cost of\ncredit.

example, securities that generate Net interest income may be\nrisk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a\ndescription of the composition of these revenue line items, see\nNotes 4, 5 and 6.\n\n(2) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion\nof the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans\nand loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on loan hedges include\nthe mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-\nmarket on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The\nfixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the\ncorporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit\nprotection. Citigroup\u2019s results of operations excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n                               11                               \nThe discussion of the results of operations for ICG below\nexcludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of\naccrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a\nreconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the\ntable above.\n                                                                \n  1Q22 vs. 1Q21                                                 \n                                                                \nNet income of $2.6 billion\ndecreased 51%, primarily\ndriven by higher cost of\ncredit, lower revenues and\nhigher expenses.\n\nRevenues decreased 2%,\nprimarily reflecting higher\nServices revenues more than\noffset by lower Banking and\nMarkets revenues. Services\nrevenues were up 15%, driven\nby higher revenues in TTS and\nSecurities services. Banking\nrevenues were down 23%\n(including the impact of gains\n(losses) on loan hedges),\nreflecting lower revenues in\nboth Investment banking and\nCorporate lending (excluding\nthe impact of gains (losses)\non loan hedges). Markets\nrevenues were down 2%,\nreflecting declines in\nrevenues in Fixed income and\nEquity markets.\n\nWithin Services:\n\n\u2022 TTS revenues increased 18%,\nwith increases across both net\ninterest income and non-\ninterest revenue. The increase\nin net interest income was\ndriven by higher deposit\nbalances and spreads, and\nhigher loan volumes, driven by\nclient momentum and the\noverall market rebound. The\nincrease in non-interest\nrevenue was primarily due to\nstrong fee growth across both\ncash and trade, reflecting\nsolid client engagement,\nincluding higher transaction\nvolumes across cross-border\nsolutions, commercial cards\nand USD clearing.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 6%, driven by an\nincrease in fee revenues due\nto growth in assets under\ncustody and clearing volumes,\nand net interest income due to\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies and higher average\ndeposit balances.\n\nWithin Markets:\n\n\u2022 Total Markets revenues\ndeclined 2% versus a strong\nprior-year quarter. In the\ncurrent quarter, activity\nlevels benefited from client\nrepositioning and strong risk\nmanagement, driven by the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s\ninterest rate increases and\noverall geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.\nNon-interest revenues\nincreased 2%, reflecting the\nhigher client activity,\nparticularly across rates and\ncurrencies, while net interest\nincome decreased 15%, largely\nreflecting a change in the mix\nof trading positions.\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues decreased 1%, as\ngrowth in EMEA and Latin\nAmerica was more than offset\nby a decline in North America.\nThe decline in revenues was\nlargely driven by lower client\nactivity in spread products,\npartially offset by strength\nin FX and commodities.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\nincreased 7%, primarily driven\nby FX, due to strong client\nengagement, particularly with\ncorporate clients. Spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome revenues decreased 19%,\nreflecting lower client\nactivity and a challenging\nenvironment due to widening\nspreads.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\ndecreased 4% reflecting a\nstrong prior-year period\ncomparison, with declines in\ncash equities, equity\nderivatives and prime finance.\nCash equities revenue\ndecreased, reflecting lower\nclient activity.\n\nEquity derivatives revenue\ndecreased against a strong\ncomparison in the prior-year\nperiod. Prime finance revenue\ndecreased driven by lower\nspreads, partially offset by\nincreased financing balances.\n\nWithin Banking:\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\ndeclined 43%, reflecting a\ndecline in the overall market\nwallet, as heightened\ngeopolitical uncertainty and\nthe overall macroeconomic\nbackdrop reduced activity in\ndebt and equity capital\nmarkets, as well as a decline\nin wallet share. Advisory\nrevenues increased 23%,\nprimarily reflecting strength\nin North America and Asia,\ndriven by growth in the market\nwallet as well as wallet share\ngains. Equity underwriting\nrevenues decreased 78%,\nreflecting a decline in North\nAmerica, EMEA and Asia, driven\nby a decline in the market\nwallet, as well as a decline\nin wallet share. Debt\nunderwriting revenues\ndecreased 27%, reflecting\nweakness in North America,\nEMEA and Asia, driven by a\ndecline in the market wallet,\nas well as a decline in wallet\nshare.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nincreased 31%, including the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges. Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, revenues\ndecreased 6%, primarily due to\nlower average loans,\nreflecting continued strong\nclient liquidity positions and\nhigher hedging costs.\n\nExpenses were up 13%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and higher volume-\nrelated expenses, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions increased during\nthe quarter to $971 million\ncompared to a benefit of $1.5\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by an ACL\nbuild.\n\nNet credit losses declined to\n$30 million from $175 million\nin the prior-year period,\ndriven by improvements in\nportfolio credit quality.\n\nThe ACL build for the quarter\nwas $941 million compared to a\nrelease of $1.7 billion for\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by a $1.5\nbillion ACL build related to\nCiti\u2019s exposures in Russia and\nthe broader impact of the war\nin Ukraine on the\nmacroeconomic environment,\npartially offset by strong\ncredit performance across the\nportfolio.

revenues,\nhigher expenses and a lower\nnet ACL release.\n\nRevenues decreased 1%, as\nhigher net interest income was\nmore than offset by lower non-\ninterest revenue.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\ndecreased 1%, reflecting lower\nrevenues in Retail banking and\nBranded cards.\n\nCards revenues decreased 1%.\nBranded cards revenues\ndecreased 1%, primarily driven\nby higher payment rates and\nhigher acquisition and rewards\ncosts, reflecting increases in\nnew accounts and customer\nengagement. Branded card spend\nvolume increased 24%,\nreflecting a continued\nrecovery in sales activity\nfrom the pandemic-driven lower\nlevels in the prior year.\n\nRetail services revenues were\nlargely unchanged, as higher\nnet interest income was offset\nby higher partner payments,\ndriven by lower net credit\nlosses. For additional\ninformation on partner\npayments, see Note 5. Retail\nservices card spend volume\nincreased 14%, also reflecting\na continued recovery in sales\nactivity from the pandemic-\ndriven lower levels in the\nprior year.\n\nRetail banking revenues\ndecreased 6%, as the benefit\nof strong deposit growth was\nmore than offset by lower\nmortgage revenues due to lower\nmortgage originations. Average\ndeposits increased 9%, driven\nby higher levels of consumer\nliquidity and strategic\nefforts to drive organic\ngrowth.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues\ndecreased 1%, driven by lower\nrevenues in Asia and Latin\nAmerica, partially offset by\nhigher revenues in North\nAmerica and EMEA. The decrease\nreflected lower client\nactivity in investment\nproducts (particularly in\nAsia), partially offset by\nhigher loans (average loans up\n5%) and higher deposit volumes\nand spreads (average deposits\nup 14%). Private bank and\nCitigold revenues were down 1%\nand 3%, respectively, while\nWealth at Work revenues\nincreased 7% with strength\nacross all products.\n\nExpenses increased 14%,\nprimarily driven by\ntransformation and business-\nled investments, and higher\nvolume-driven expenses,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $376 million, compared to a\nbenefit of $557 million in the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by a lower net ACL\nrelease, partially offset by\nlower net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses decreased 30%,\nconsisting of lower net credit\nlosses in both Branded cards\n(down 45% to $303 million) and\nRetail services (down 33% to\n$252 million), primarily\ndriven by lower loan volumes\nand improved delinquencies,\nprimarily as a result of the\nhigher payment rates.\n\nThe net ACL release was $1.1\nbillion, compared to a net\nrelease of $1.6 billion in the\nprior-year period. The net ACL\nrelease in the current quarter\nprimarily reflected\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality and the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook.

In 2021, Citi entered into\nagreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in Australia\nand the Philippines, and made a decision to wind down and close\nits Korea consumer banking business (see Note 2 for additional\ninformation). In early 2022, Citi entered into agreements to\nsell its consumer banking businesses in Bahrain, India,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nMexico Consumer/SBMM provides traditional retail banking and\nbranded card products to consumer and small business customers\nand provides traditional middle-market banking products and\nservices to commercial customers through Citibanamex. As\npreviously disclosed, Citi is also pursuing an exit of Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM. For additional information, see Citi\u2019s Current\nReport on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 11, 2022.\n\nAt March 31, 2022, on a combined basis, the Legacy Franchises\nbusinesses had 1,467 retail branches, $29 billion in retail\nbanking loans and $51 billion in deposits. In addition, the\nbusinesses had $8 billion in outstanding card loan balances, and\nMexico SBMM had $7 billion in outstanding corporate loan\nbalances. These amounts exclude approximately $29 billion of\nloans ($20 billion of retail banking loans and $9 billion of\ncredit card loan balances) and $31 billion of deposits, all of\nwhich were reclassified to Other assets and Other liabilities\nheld-for-sale (HFS) at March 31, 2022 as a result of Citi\u2019s\nagreements to sell its consumer banking businesses in the above\nlisted countries.

lower\nrevenues, higher expenses and\nhigher cost of credit.\n\nResults for the current\nquarter included Asia Consumer\ndivestiture-related impacts of\n$677 million ($588 million\nafter-tax) due to (i) costs\nconsisting of a goodwill\nwrite-down of $535 million\n($489 million after-tax),\nrecorded in expenses, due to\nthe re-segmentation and timing\nof divestitures, as well as\nadditional costs related to\nthe Korea voluntary early\nretirement program (VERP) of\n$24 million (approximately $18\nmillion after-tax); and (ii)\nthe revenue impact due to a\npretax loss from the sale of\nthe Australia consumer\nbusiness of $(118) million\n($81 million after-tax). This\npretax loss included an ACL\nrelease of $(104) million and\na net revenue impact of $(14)\nmillion due to contractual\nadjustments of the divestiture\nrecorded in Other revenue .\n\nRevenues decreased 14%,\nreflecting lower revenues\nacross Asia Consumer.\n\nAsia Consumer revenues\ndecreased 27%, largely\nresulting from the Korea wind-\ndown and lower investments and\ninsurance revenues due to\nmuted investment activity in\nAsia. Average loans decreased\n58% and average deposits\ndecreased 57%, due to\napproximately $27 billion of\naverage loans and\napproximately $26 billion of\naverage deposits reclassified\nto held-for-sale as a result\nof Citi\u2019s entry into\nagreements to sell its\nconsumer banking businesses in\nmultiple exit markets.\n\nMexico Consumer/SBMM revenues\nwere largely unchanged. Retail\nbanking revenues increased 2%\nand cards revenues decreased\n2%, the latter due to higher\nacquisition and rewards costs.\n\nExpenses increased 31%,\nincluding the Asia\ndivestiture-related costs.\nExcluding the Asia\ndivestiture-related costs,\nexpenses decreased 1%,\nprimarily driven by\nproductivity savings,\npartially offset by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation.\n\nProvisions of $160 million\ncompared to $44 million in the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by a lower net ACL\nrelease, partially offset by\nlower net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses decreased 74%,\nprimarily reflecting lower\nloan volumes and improved\ndelinquencies.\n\nThe net ACL release was $146\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $582 million in the prior-\nyear period. The net ACL\nrelease in the current quarter\nprimarily reflected an\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality.

Citi\u2019s CET1 Capital\nratio under the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches was 11.4%\nas of March 31, 2022, compared\nto 12.3% as of December 31,\n2021, relative to an effective\nregulatory minimum CET1\nCapital ratio requirement of\n10.0% under the Advanced\nApproaches for both periods.\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\ndecreased under both the\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches during the\nthree months ended March 31,\n2022, as an increase in risk-\nweighted assets due to the\nadoption of SA-CCR (see\nbelow), the return of capital\nto shareholders and interest-\nrate-driven adverse net\nmovements in AOCI were\npartially offset by net income\nof $4.3 billion.\n\nAdoption of the Standardized\nApproach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk (SA-CCR)\n\nAs previously disclosed, Citi\nadopted SA-CCR as of January\n1, 2022. SA-CCR replaced the\nCurrent Exposure Method (CEM),\nwhich was the previous\nmethodology used to calculate\nexposure for derivative\ncontracts.\n\nAdoption of SA-CCR increased\nCitigroup\u2019s risk-weighted\nassets measured under the\nStandardized Approach by\napproximately $51 billion,\nwhich resulted in a 49 basis\npoint decrease to Citigroup\u2019s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio under the Standardized\nApproach on January 1, 2022.\nAdoption of SA-CCR also\nincreased Citigroup\u2019s risk-\nweighted assets measured under\nthe Advanced Approaches by\napproximately $29 billion,\nwhich resulted in a 29 basis\npoint decrease to Citigroup\u2019s\nCET1 Capital ratio under the\nAdvanced Approaches on January\n1, 2022.\n\nFor additional information on\nSA-CCR, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Adoption of the\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nRegulatory Capital\nTreatment\u2014Modified Transition\nof the Current Expected Credit\nLosses Methodology\n\nAs previously disclosed,\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios reflect certain\ndeferrals based on the\nmodified regulatory capital\ntransition provision related\nto the current expected credit\nlosses (CECL) standard. On\nJanuary 1, 2022, these\ndeferrals commenced phase-in\nto regulatory capital at 25%\nper year, which resulted in an\napproximate 6 basis point\ndecrease to Citigroup\u2019s CET1\nCapital ratio. The CECL\ntransition provision will\ncontinue to phase-in to\nregulatory capital on January\n1 of each year through January\n1, 2025.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe impact of the modified\nCECL transition provision, see\n\u201cCapital Resources (Full\nAdoption of CECL)\u201d below, and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Treatment\u2014Modified\nTransition of the Current\nExpected Credit Losses\nMethodology\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2021\nForm 10-K.\n                               18                               \n                                                                \n  Citigroup\u2019s Capital Resources                                 \n                                                                \nThe following table sets forth Citi\u2019s effective minimum risk-\nbased capital requirements as of March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021:\n                                                                \n            Advanc\u2026                    Standa\u2026                  \n            Approa\u2026                    Approa\u2026                  \n              March       Decem\u2026         March       Decem\u2026     \n                31,          31,           31,          31,     \n               2022         2021          2022         2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Common                                                        \n  Equity                                                        \n  Tier 1       10.0  %      10.0  %       10.5  %      10.5  %  \n  Capit\u2026                                                        \n  ratio\u2026                                                        \n  Tier 1                                                        \n  Capit\u2026       11.5         11.5          12.0         12.0     \n  ratio\u2026                                                        \n  Total                                                         \n  Capit\u2026       13.5         13.5          14.0         14.0     \n  ratio\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) Citi\u2019s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements\ninclude the 3.0% Stress Capital Buffer and 3.0% GSIB surcharge\nunder the Standardized Approach, and the 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer and 3.0% GSIB surcharge under the Advanced\nApproaches (all of which must be composed of Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital).

The amount\nexcluded was reduced by $1.6 billion of net DTLs primarily\nassociated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets\nthat are separately deducted from capital. DTAs arising from tax\ncarry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs\narising from temporary differences are required to be deducted\nfrom capital only if these DTAs exceed 10%/15% limitations under\nthe U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(5) Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs\narising from temporary differences and significant common stock\ninvestments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At March\n31, 2022, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from\ntemporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation. At\nDecember 31, 2021, none of these assets were in excess of the\n10%/15% limitations.\n\n(6) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities that were previously eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules. Commencing January 1,\n2022, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities have been\nfully phased out of Tier 2 Capital.\n\n(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit\nlosses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25%\nof credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for\ncredit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted\nassets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in\nwhich eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit\nlosses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the\nextent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit\nreserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible\nfor inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under\nthe Advanced Approaches framework

Facility\nrisk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of\ndefault of the obligor and factors that affect the loss given\ndefault of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal\nobligor ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are\nconsidered investment grade, while those below are considered\nnon-investment grade.\n                               31                               \nThe following table presents\nthe corporate credit portfolio\nby facility risk rating as a\npercentage of the total\ncorporate credit portfolio:\n                                                                \n                    Total                                       \n                 exposure          December                     \n                March 31,               31,       March 31,     \n                     2022              2021            2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A             49  %             48  %           47  %  \n  BBB                  33                34              33     \n  BB/B                 16                16              17     \n  CCC or                2                 2               3     \n  below                                                         \n  Total               100  %            100  %          100  %  \n                                                                \nNote: Total exposure includes\ndirect outstandings and\nunfunded lending commitments.\nIn addition to the obligor and\nfacility risk ratings assigned\nto all exposures, Citi may\nclassify exposures in the\ncorporate credit portfolio.\nThese classifications are\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\ninterpretation of the U.S.\nbanking regulators\u2019 definition\nof criticized exposures, which\nmay categorize exposures as\nspecial mention, substandard,\ndoubtful or loss. Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly, and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citigroup\nbelieves the corporate credit\nportfolio to be appropriately\nrated and classified as of\nMarch 31, 2022. Citigroup has\ntaken action to adjust\ninternal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, downgrades may\nresult in the purchase of\nadditional credit derivatives\nor other risk mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

As shown\nin the chart above, the first\nquarter of 2022 net credit\nloss rate in Asia Consumer\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, driven by\nthe impact of the charge-off\nof peak delinquent loans in\nrecent quarters, resulting in\nlower delinquencies that led\nto lower net credit losses in\nthe current quarter. The\ndecrease was also driven by\nthe reclassification of\napproximately $29 billion of\nloans ($20 billion of retail\nbanking loans and $9 billion\nof credit card loan balances)\nto held-for-sale as a result\nof Citi\u2019s agreements to sell\nits consumer banking\nbusinesses in Australia, the\nPhilippines, Bahrain, India,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan,\nThailand and Vietnam (Asia HFS\nreclass). The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate decreased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, mainly driven by\nthe impact of the Asia HFS\nreclass and the charge-off of\npeak delinquencies in recent\nquarters, as elevated losses\nreturned to pre-pandemic\nlevels.

These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail\nservices are generally still accruing interest. Citigroup\u2019s\npolicy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans\nuntil 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy\nfiling has been received earlier.\n\n(5) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios for Retail banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agencies since the potential loss\npredominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored\nagencies.

Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and hence the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nreclassifications commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21), the\nPhilippines (4Q21) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia,\nTaiwan, Thailand and Vietnam (1Q22). See Note 2 for additional\ninformation.\n\n(8) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential loss predominantly resides with the U.S.\nagencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP\nloans) were $124 million ($0.4 billion), $138 million ($0.4\nbillion) and $169 million ($0.4 billion) at March 31, 2022,\nDecember 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $34 million, $35 million and $55 million at March\n31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.\n\n(9) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff based on their internal risk classification and not on their\ndelinquency status.\n\nN/A Not applicable\n                               40                               \n

Corporate non-accrual\nloans may still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are\ncharged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written\ndown to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent\nwith industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest\non credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within\nConsumer loans and Corporate loans on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The increase in corporate non-accrual loans relates to\nRussia exposures, which are adequately reserved for.\n\n(2) Approximately 66%, 56%, 58%, 55% and 54% of Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans were performing at March 31, 2022, December\n31, 2021, September 30, 2021, June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2021,\nre spectively.\n\n(3) The March 31, 2022 total corporate non-accrual loans\nrepresented 0.60% of total corporate loans .\n\n(4) Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries\nfor all periods presented.\n                               47                               \nThe changes in Citigroup\u2019s non-accrual loans were as follows:\n                                                                \n           Th\u2026                           T\u2026                     \n           Mo\u2026                           M\u2026                     \n           En\u2026                           E\u2026                     \n           Ma\u2026                           M\u2026                     \n           31,                           3\u2026                     \n           20\u2026                           2\u2026                     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026       Co\u2026       Co\u2026       To\u2026       C\u2026       Co\u2026       T\u2026  \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  N\u2026                                                            \n  l\u2026                                                            \n  at    $  1,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  3,\u2026    $  3\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  5\u2026  \n  b\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  q\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026       820       299       1,\u2026       4\u2026       698       1\u2026  \n  S\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026                                                            \n  t\u2026        -1       -1\u2026       -1\u2026       -\u2026       -58       -\u2026  \n  to                                                            \n  H\u2026                                                            \n  R\u2026                                                            \n  to       -1\u2026       -1\u2026       -3\u2026        \u2014       -2\u2026       -\u2026  \n  p\u2026                                                            \n  P\u2026       -3\u2026       -96       -4\u2026       -\u2026       -1\u2026       -\u2026  \n  C\u2026       -49       -1\u2026       -2\u2026       -\u2026       -4\u2026       -\u2026  \n  O\u2026        -1        10         9       -\u2026       -29       -\u2026  \n  E\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  1,\u2026    $  3,\u2026    $  2\u2026    $  2,\u2026    $  5\u2026  \n  b\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \nThe table below summarizes Citigroup\u2019s other real estate owned\n(OREO) assets.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued\nto third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup)\nand Citi\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries (including\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries)\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup. As of March 31,\n2022, non-bank included $64.5\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries that\nare consolidated into\nCitigroup Inc., the parent\nholding company. Certain\nCitigroup consolidated hedging\nactivities are also included\nin this line. (2) Local\ncountry and other includes\ndebt issued by Citi\u2019s\naffiliates in support of their\nlocal operations. Within non-\nbank, certain secured\nfinancing is also included.\n(3) Predominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Branded cards\nreceivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding was\nlargely unchanged year-over-\nyear, as declines in FHLB\nborrowings and unsecured\nbenchmark senior debt at the\nbank were offset by the\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt at the non-bank entities.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding was largely\nunchanged as decreases in FHLB\nborrowings at the bank were\nmostly offset by an increase\nin unsecured benchmark senior\ndebt at the non-bank entities.\nAs part of its liability\nmanagement, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During the\nfirst quarter of 2022, Citi\nredeemed or repurchased an\naggregate of approximately\n$5.7 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               52

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n\nSecured Funding Transactions\n\nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $204\nbillion as of March 31, 2022\ndecreased 7% from the prior-\nyear period and increased 7%\nsequentially, driven by normal\nbusiness activity. The average\nbalance for secured funding\nwas approximately $210 billion\nfor the quarter ended March\n31, 2022.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nMarch 31, 2022.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $30 billion decreased 6%\nyear-over-year, reflecting a\ndecline in FHLB advances,\npartially offset by commercial\npaper issuance. On a\nsequential basis, short-term\nborrowing increased 8%, driven\nprimarily by commercial paper\nissuance (see Note 16 for\nfurther information on\nCitigroup\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 outstanding short-\nterm borrowings).\n                               54                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured financing transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely affected.\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.6\nbillion, unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2021. Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured funding transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of March 31,\n2022, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup and Citibank across\nall three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$1.7 billion, compared to $1.4\nbillion as of December 31,\n2021 (see also Note 19). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. As of\nMarch 31, 2022, Citibank had\nliquidity commitments of\napproximately $9.1 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\ncompared to $9.0 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 (see Note 18\nfor additional information).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients\u2019 adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               55                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(127) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof March 31, 2022.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nThe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income (IRE) was\nlargely unchanged from the\nfourth quarter of 2021, with\nincreased expected gains in\nnon-USD currencies offset by\ndecreased expected gains due\nto USD rate moves.\n\nThe decline in the estimated\nimpact to AOCI primarily\nreflected a continuation of\nthe positioning strategy of\nCiti\u2019s investment securities\nand related interest rate\nderivatives portfolio.\n\nIn the event of a parallel\ninstantaneous 100 bps increase\nin interest rates, as of March\n31, 2022, Citi expects that\nthe $3.4 billion initial\nnegative impact to AOCI would\nbe offset in stockholders\u2019\nequity through the expected\nrecovery of the impact on AOCI\nthrough accretion of Citi\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio over\napproximately 15 months.\n\nCiti is planning to transition\nthe sensitivity analysis for\nits net interest income,\nemploying enhanced\nmethodologies and changes to\ncertain assumptions. The\nchanges include, among other\nthings, assumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet\n(holding it static), coupled\nwith revisions to the\ntreatment of certain business\ncontributions to IRE. These\nchanges will be implemented\nand disclosed before the end\nof 2022 and will result in a\nbetter reflection of the\nnature of the portfolios.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest income, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under five\ndifferent changes in interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and Citi\u2019s other\ncurrencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d). The rate\nscenarios are also impacted by\nconvexity related to mortgage\nproducts.\n                               56                               \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  of                                                            \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  ex\u2026                                                           \n  as                                                            \n  ot\u2026                                                           \n  no\u2026                                                           \n  Ov\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  10\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  an\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to        Sce\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026  \n  net          1          2           3          4           5  \n  in\u2026        100        100           \u2014          \u2014       (100)  \n  in\u2026        100          \u2014         100       (10\u2026       (100)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.\u2026    $   482    $   604    $     27    $   -36    $   -752  \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  All                                                           \n  ot\u2026        705        660          41        -41        -523  \n  cu\u2026                                                           \n  To\u2026    $  1,1\u2026    $  1,2\u2026    $     68    $   -77    $  -1,2\u2026  \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  -3,\u2026    $  -1,\u2026    $  -1,2\u2026    $   796    $  3,041  \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to                                                            \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  Eq\u2026        -18        -11          -8          5          14  \n  Ti\u2026                                                           \n  1                                                             \n  Ca\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes\nthat the rate change will\noccur instantaneously. Changes\nin interest rates for\nmaturities between the\novernight rate and the 10-year\nrate are interpolated.\n\n(1) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs shown in the table above,\nthe magnitude of the impact to\nCiti\u2019s net interest income and\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 as compared to Scenario 3.\nThis is because the\ncombination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n\nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.4 billion,\nor 0.9%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s foreign\ncurrency translation\nadjustment in AOCI , net of\nhedges. This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nEuro and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the impact\nof these changes on Citi\u2019s TCE\nand Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

The increase in non-\nICG Markets NII primarily\nreflected higher interest\nincome from cards, higher\ndeposit volumes and spreads as\nwell as income from Citi\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio. The\ndecrease in ICG Markets NII\nlargely reflected a change in\nthe mix of trading positions\nin support of client activity.\n\nCiti\u2019s NIM was 2.05% on a\ntaxable equivalent basis in\nthe first

The benefit reflects the\nfact that the risks within individual and across risk types are\nnot perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a\ngiven day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to\neach risk type.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of March 31, 2022, there was one back-\ntesting exception observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR for the\nprior 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K. LIBOR Transition\nRisk In March 2022, U.S. federal legislation was signed into law\nthat provides for the use of a statutory replacement for the\novernight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month tenors\nof USD LIBOR in all contracts governed by U.S. law. The Federal\nReserve Board is required to select a Secured Overnight Funding\nRate (SOFR)-based replacement for USD LIBOR and issue rules to\nimplement the legislation no later than 180 days after its\nenactment. Citi continues to review the effect of this\nlegislation, which is expected to facilitate the transition to\nreplacement rates for Citi\u2019s USD LIBOR-linked securities, loans\nand contracts without fallbacks or fallbacks based on USD LIBOR\nthat have not yet been remediated.

For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries,\n\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers. As an\nexample, with respect to the\nU.K., only 34% of corporate\nloans presented in the table\nbelow are to U.K. domiciled\nentities (37% for unfunded\ncommitments), with the balance\nof the loans predominately to\nEuropean domiciled\ncounterparties. Approximately\n85% of the total U.K. funded\nloans and 84% of the total\nU.K. unfunded commitments were\ninvestment grade as of March\n31, 2022.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

In\nMarch 2022, Citi announced it\nhad expanded the scope of the\npreviously announced\ndivestiture to include other\nlines of business beyond its\nconsumer activities. Citi will\ncontinue to reduce its\noperations and exposures in\nRussia. Citi has ceased\nsoliciting any new business or\nnew clients in Russia. Due to\nthe nature of banking and\nfinancial services operations,\nescalation of the war in\nUkraine, the financial and\neconomic sanctions that have\nbeen implemented by the U.S.,\nthe U.K., the EU and other\njurisdictions, the divestiture\nand other reduction of\nactivities will take time to\ncomplete.

AO Citibank had AFS debt securities\nlosses during the first quarter of 2022 due to yield increases,\nwhich were reflected in AOCI , although no credit impairment was\nrecognized on the losses.\n\n(2) Net mark-to-market on OTC derivatives and securities\nlending/borrowing transactions (repos). Exposures are shown net\nof collateral and inclusive of credit valuation adjustments\n(CVA) and include margin loans.\n\n(3) Unfunded exposure includes unfunded corporate lending\ncommitments, letters of credit and other contingencies.\n\n(4) Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the\nCentral Bank of Russia.\n\n(5) The majority of AO Citibank\u2019s third-party exposures were\nfunded with domestic deposit liabilities from both ICG and\npersonal banking clients.\n                               67                               \nBeginning in January 2022,\nCiti began actively reducing\nits operations in Russia and\nRussia-related exposures,\nresulting in a $1.9 billion\ndecline in Citi\u2019s Russia-\nrelated exposures during the\nfirst quarter of 2022. This\nreduction primarily reflected\na decrease in ICG loans in the\nquarter due to borrower\npaydowns, limiting extension\nof new credit and a\ndepreciation in the ruble\nagainst the US dollar. The\nreduction was also driven by a\ndecrease in AFS securities in\nthe quarter, largely driven by\nsales and mark-to-market\nlosses in AOCI from higher\nyields and the impact of\ndepreciation of the ruble. The\nincrease in cash and deposits\nwith banks in the quarter was\ndue to Citi\u2019s actions to\nreduce credit exposures as\nwell as the placement of\nhigher excess client liquidity\nand higher client deposit\nbalances. Reverse repurchase\nagreements declined in the\nquarter due to a wind-down of\npositions with financial\ninstitutions and clearinghouse\ncounterparties. Finally, the\ndecline in the quarter of\nCiti\u2019s additional exposures to\nRussian counterparties not\nheld by AO Citibank was also\ndue to Citi\u2019s risk mitigation\nefforts.\n\nCiti\u2019s resulting net\ninvestment in Russia was\napproximately $0.7 billion as\nof March 31, 2022 (compared to\n$1 billion as of December 31,\n2021). The majority of Citi\u2019s\nnet investment was hedged for\nforeign currency depreciation\nas of March 31, 2022, using\nforward foreign exchange\ncontracts executed with\ninternational peer banks. In\naddition, Citi is exposed to a\ncurrency translation\nadjustment (CTA) loss of\napproximately $1.0 billion\nrelated to Russia in the event\nof a loss of control or\nsubstantial liquidation of AO\nCitibank (see \u201cDeconsolidation\nRisk\u201d below).\n\n1Q22 Earnings Impacts on\nCiti\u2019s Businesses\n\nBoth Citi\u2019s ICG and Legacy\nFranchises segments were\nimpacted by a broad array of\nmacroeconomic factors,\nincluding the effects of the\nwar in Ukraine:\n\n\u2022 ICG Markets revenues\ndeclined 2% versus a very\nstrong first quarter in the\nprior year. Activity levels in\nMarkets benefited from client\nrepositioning and strong risk\nmanagement, driven by the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s\ninterest rate increases and\noverall geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic uncertainty.\nDuring the quarter, Markets\nalso benefited from\nsignificantly higher FX and\ncommodities volatilities and\nincreased spreads.\n\n\u2022 ICG Banking revenues of $1.9\nbillion decreased 23%,\nincluding the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges, driven by\nheightened geopolitical\nuncertainty, including the\nimpact of the war in Ukraine,\nand overall macroeconomic\nbackdrop, which reduced\nactivity in debt and equity\ncapital markets. Investment\nbanking revenues declined 43%,\nreflecting a decline in the\noverall market wallet.\nSpecifically, equity\nunderwriting revenues and debt\nunderwriting revenues\ndecreased by 78% and 27%,\nrespectively, due to weakness\nin the market wallet across\nNorth America, EMEA and Asia,\nlargely due to uncertainty\ncaused by the war in Ukraine,\nwhich created a less conducive\nmarket backdrop for capital\nmarkets origination activities\nduring the quarter.\n\n\u2022 Legacy Franchises revenues\nof $1.9 billion decreased 14%,\nlargely resulting from the\nKorea wind-down, as well as\nmuted investment activity in\nAsia. Revenues in Citi\u2019s\n\nRussia consumer business in\nAsia Consumer decreased 6%\nyear-over-year to $32 million,\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof sanctions, the cessation of\nthe acquisition of new\naccounts and a reduction in\ninvestment sales.\n\n\u2022 Citigroup cost of credit\nincluded a net ACL build of\n$1.9 billion, consisting of\napproximately $1 billion\nrelated to Citi\u2019s exposures to\nRussian counterparties and\napproximately $900 million\nrelated to the impact of the\nwar in Ukraine on the broader\nglobal macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans increased by\napproximately $320 million,\nprimarily related to Citi\u2019s\nICG exposures in Russia, which\nCiti believes are adequately\nreserved for. Approximately\n66% of Citi\u2019s overall\ncorporate non-accrual loans\nwere performing at March 31,\n2022.\n\nSanctions and Other\nOperational Risks\n\nCiti has undertaken\nsignificantly more sanctions\nscreening and other\nrequirements as a result of\nthe war in Ukraine, as the\nU.S., the U.K. and the EU have\nimposed increasingly extensive\nsanctions and export controls\nagainst Russian-related\nentities and individuals. This\nhas resulted in increased\noperational complexity for\nCiti related to its Russia-\nrelated exposures, including\ndelaying payments to\ncounterparties as a result of\nthe need for additional\ncontrols. Citi\u2019s Russia-\nrelated ACL build in the first\nquarter of 2022 also reflected\nspecific corporate clients\nthat were sanctioned by\nvarious governmental\nauthorities.\n\nCiti continues to comply with\nall applicable sanction\nrequirements and export\ncontrols, including obtaining\nrequired sanctions-related\nlicenses. This response has\nincluded enhanced operational\ncontrols and management\noversight to maintain\ncompliance and minimize\ndisruption to client\noperations.\n\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022,\nCiti completed a goodwill\nimpairment test and recorded a\ngoodwill impairment charge of\n$535 million to the Asia\nConsumer reporting unit within\nLegacy Franchises , due to the\nre-segmentation and timing of\ndivestitures and unrelated to\nthe war in Ukraine. In the\nquarter, Citi did not\nexperience any impairments\nrelated to the reporting units\nwithin ICG based on its latest\nimpairment test. In addition,\nCiti had approximately $50\nmillion of long-lived assets\nin Russia that did not\nexperience any impairment. For\nadditional information on\ngoodwill impairment, see Note\n15.\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Planned Sale of Certain Russia Businesses              \n                                                                \nAs discussed above, Citi\nannounced it had expanded the\nscope of the divestiture of\ncertain activities in Russia\nbeyond the consumer business\nto include commercial banking.\nCiti has commenced sale\ndiscussions with a number of\npotential buyers. Any\nadditional financial or\neconomic sanctions that may be\nimplemented by the U.S., the\nU.K., the EU and any other\njurisdictions, as well as any\ngovernmental approvals that\nmay be required for any\ntransaction, may cause delays\nor reduce the certainty of\nsuch transaction being\nconcluded. Such delays may be\nsignificant.\n                               68                               \n                                                                \n  Deconsolidation Risk                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s continued operations in\nRussia subject it to various\nrisks, including, among\nothers, foreign currency\nvolatility, including\ndevaluations; business\nrestrictions; sanctions or\nasset freezes; or other\ndeconsolidation events (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K).\nExamples of triggers that may\nresult in deconsolidation of\nAO Citibank include voluntary\nor forced sale of ownership or\nloss of control due to actions\nof relevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator or regulator);\nrevocation of banking license;\nand loss of ability to elect a\nboard of directors or appoint\nmembers of senior management.\nAs of March 31, 2022, Citi\ncontinued to consolidate AO\nCitibank because none of the\ndeconsolidation triggers was\nmet.\n\nIn the event of a loss of\ncontrol or substantial\nliquidation of AO Citibank,\nCiti would be required to\nwrite off its net investment\nof approximately $0.7 billion\n(compared to $1 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021) and\nrecognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.0 billion\nthrough earnings. Once\nrecognized in earnings, this\nCTA loss would be removed from\nthe AOCI component of equity\nand therefore would have a\nneutral impact to Citi\u2019s\nCapital. As discussed above,\nthe majority of Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment was hedged for\nforeign currency depreciation\nas of March 31, 2022. For\ninformation about CTA\ncomponents of AOCI and related\nrisks, see Note 17.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients              \n                                                                \nCiti serves as paying agent on\nbonds issued by various\nentities in Russia, including\nboth Russian corporate clients\nand the Russian Ministry of\nFinance. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nits role as paying agent, Citi\nacts as an agent of its\nclient, the bond issuer,\nreceiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients that are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or block\nthe funds until applicable\nsanctions are lifted or the\npayment is otherwise\nauthorized under applicable\nlaw.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its presence in\nRussia and association with\nRussian individuals or\nentities, whether subject to\nsanctions or not, including\nCiti\u2019s inability to support\nits global clients in Russia\nas part of its core value\nproposition, which could\nadversely affect its broader\nclient relationships and\nbusinesses; involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations;\nperceived misalignment of\nCiti\u2019s actions to its stated\nstrategy toward Russia; and\nthe reputational impact on\nCiti\u2019s Russia business from\nits activity and engagement\nwith Ukraine or with non-\nRussian clients exiting their\nRussia businesses. Citi has\nconsidered the potential for\nreputation risk and taken\nactions to mitigate such\nrisks. Citi established a new\nRussia Special Review Process\nwith Management\u2019s Reputations\nRisk Committee with oversight\nfor significant Russia-related\nreputation risks and completed\na number of reputation risk\nreviews of matters with a\nRussian nexus.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to divest certain\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the sale\nprocess, which may take\nsignificant time to complete.\nAlso, sanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi continues to\nperform services for, conduct\nbusiness with, or deal in,\nnon-sanctioned Russian-owned\nbusinesses and Russian assets.\nThis has attracted, and will\nlikely continue to attract,\nnegative attention, despite\nthe expansion of the scope of\nCiti\u2019s divestiture, cessation\nof new business and client\noriginations, and reduction of\nother exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

In\naddition to receiving regular\nbriefings from management, the\nfull Board has routinely been\ninvited to attend portions of\nthe RMC meetings for\ndiscussions related to the war\nin Ukraine, including with\nrespect to Citi\u2019s risk\n                               69                               \nexposures and stress testing.\nThe reports to the Board and\nits Committees from senior\nmanagement who represent the\nimpacted businesses and the\nEMEA region, Independent Risk\nManagement, Finance,\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement, including those\nindividuals responsible for\nsanctions compliance, and\nHuman Resources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its ICG businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 250\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is a top priority.\n\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. Citi\nexposures in Ukraine are not\nsignificant enough to be\nincluded in the \u201cTop 25\nCountry Exposures\u201d table\nabove. As of March 31, 2022,\nthese exposures amounted to\n$0.9 billion (compared to $1.2\nbillion as of December 31,\n2021) and were exclusively\ncomposed of third-party assets\nheld on the Citi Ukraine\nsubsidiary.\n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its ICG businesses. As\nof March 31, 2022, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.6 billion. Citi uses the\nU.S. dollar as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\ncountries that are deemed\nhighly inflationary under U.S.\nGAAP. Citi uses Argentina\u2019s\nofficial market exchange rate\nto remeasure its net Argentine\npeso-denominated assets into\nthe U.S. dollar. As of March\n31, 2022, the official\nArgentine peso exchange rate\nagainst the U.S. dollar was\n111.00.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nCentral Bank of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat restrict Citi\u2019s ability\nto access U.S. dollars in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nAs a result, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations is likely to\ncontinue to increase as Citi\ngenerates net income in its\nArgentine franchise and its\nearnings cannot be remitted.\n\nDue to the currency controls\nimplemented by the Central\nBank of Argentina, certain\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms have developed that\nsome Argentine entities may\nuse to obtain U.S. dollars,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of March 31,\n2022, the international NDF\nmarket had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge its Argentine peso\nexposure. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute NDF contracts for this\nunhedged exposure in the\nfuture, Citi would record\ndevaluations on its net\nArgentine peso\u2010denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nany benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate ACL on\nits Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of March\n31, 2022. However, U.S.\nregulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures. For additional\ninformation on emerging\nmarkets risks, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K.\n                               70                               \nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT\nESTIMATES\n\nThis section contains a\nsummary of Citi\u2019s most\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. The fair value of\nthese instruments is reported\non Citi\u2019s Consolidated\n\nBalance Sheet with the changes\nin fair value recognized in\neither the Consolidated\nStatement of Income or in AOCI\n.\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nare recognized in earnings.\nWhere Citi does not intend to\nsell the security nor could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nthe portion of the loss\nrelated to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome.

In addition,\nCiti reserves for expected\ncredit losses on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables. These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover an R&S timeframe. During\nthe first quarter of 2022,\nCiti updated its R&S forecast\nperiods to use an eight-\nquarter R&S period for\nconsumer and corporate loans.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses a forward-\nlooking base macroeconomic\nforecast. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects economic\nuncertainty using alternative\ndownside macroeconomic\nscenarios and portfolio\ncharacteristics and current\neconomic conditions not\ncaptured in the quantitative\n\ncomponent. Both the\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents are further\ndiscussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation, and (iv) a\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default (PD),\nloss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD). The\nloss likelihood and severity\nmodels used for estimating\nexpected credit losses are\nsensitive to changes in\nmacroeconomic variables that\ninform the forecasts, and\ncover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates (among\nother things), as well as\nother current economic factors\nand credit trends, including\nhousing prices, unemployment\nand gross domestic product\n(GDP).\n                               72                               \nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes,\namong other things, management\nadjustments to reflect\neconomic uncertainty based on\nthe likelihood and severity of\ndownside scenarios and certain\nportfolio characteristics not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as\nconcentrations, collateral\nvaluation, model limitations,\nidiosyncratic events and other\nfactors as required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent also reflects\nremaining uncertainty around\nthe estimated impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the war\nin Ukraine on credit losses.\nThis includes, among other\nthings, potential delay in\ncredit losses due to various\ngovernment stimulus actions\nand potential effects on\nconsumer behavior and market\nliquidity. The extent of the\nimpact of the war in Ukraine\nwill depend on the spillover\neffects on European and global\nmacroeconomic and market\nfactors, including inflation,\ninterest rates and commodity\nprices. 1Q22 Changes in the\nACL In the first quarter of\n2022, Citi released $1.1\nbillion of the ACL for its\nconsumer portfolios and\nincreased the ACL by $1.0\nbillion for its corporate\nportfolios primarily related\nto Russia, for a net release\nof $0.1 billion. The release\nin the consumer ACL was driven\nprimarily a reduction in\nreserves related to COVID\nuncertainty. The build in the\ncorporate ACL was primarily\nrelated to Citi\u2019s exposures in\nRussia and the broader impact\nof the war in Ukraine on the\nglobal macroeconomic\nenvironment. Based on its\nlatest macroeconomic forecast,\nCiti believes its analysis of\nthe ACL reflects the forward\nview of the economic\nenvironment as of March 31,\n2022. Macroeconomic Variables\nCiti considers a multitude of\nmacroeconomic variables for\nboth the base and downside\nmacroeconomic forecasts it\nuses to estimate the ACL,\nincluding domestic and\ninternational variables for\nits global portfolios and\nexposures.

Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 1Q22, U.S. Real GDP growth\nis expected to remain strong\nduring the remainder of 2022\nand in 2023, and the\nunemployment rate is expected\nto continue to improve as the\nU.S. moves past the peak of\nthe pandemic-related health\nand economic crisis. Consumer\nAs discussed above, Citi\nreleased $1.1 billion of the\nACL for its consumer\nportfolios in the first\nquarter of 2022, which reduced\nthe ACL balance to $12.4\nbillion, or 3.53% of total\nconsumer loans at March 31,\n2022. Citi\u2019s consumer ACL is\nlargely driven by the cards\nbusinesses. For U.S. Cards,\nthe level of reserves as a\npercentage to EOP loans\ndecreased to 7.56% at March\n31, 2022, compared to 8.10% at\nDecember 31, 2021, primarily\ndriven by a reduction in\nreserves related to COVID\nuncertainty. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to EOP\nloans decreased to 1.2% at\nMarch 31, 2022, compared to\n1.3% at December 31, 2021.\nCorporate Citi had a corporate\nACLL build of $0.6 billion in\nthe first quarter of 2022,\nwhich increased the ACLL\nreserve balance to $3.0\nbillion, or 1.00% of total\nfunded loans. The build was\nprimarily driven by exposures\nin Russia and the broader\nimpact of the war in Ukraine\non the global macroeconomic\nenvironment. ACLUC The total\nallowance for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC) build in the first\nquarter of 2022 increased $0.5\nbillion, primarily driven by\nexposures in Russia and the\nbroader impact of the war in\nUkraine. The total ACLUC\nreserve balance included in\nOther liabilities was $2.3\nbillion at March 31, 2022.\nACLL and Non-accrual Ratios At\nMarch 31, 2022, the ratio of\nthe ACLL to total funded loans\nwas 2.35% (3.53% for consumer\nloans and 1.00% for corporate\nloans), compared to 2.49% at\nDecember 31, 2021 (3.73% for\nconsumer loans and 0.85% for\ncorporate loans). Citi\u2019s total\nnon-accrual loans were $3.4\nbillion at March 31, 2022,\nlargely unchanged from\nDecember 31, 2021. Consumer\nnon-accrual loans decreased\n$309 million to $1.5 billion\nat March 31, 2022 from $1.8\nbillion at December 31, 2021,\nwhile corporate non-accrual\nloans increased $313\n                               73                               \nmillion to $1.9 billion at\nMarch 31, 2022 from $1.6\nbillion at December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, the ratio of non-\naccrual loans to total\ncorporate loans was 0.60%, and\n0.43% of non-accrual loans to\ntotal consumer loans, at March\n31, 2022. Regulatory Capital\nImpact Citi has elected to\nphase in the CECL impact for\nregulatory capital purposes.\nAfter two years with no impact\non capital, the CECL adoption\nimpact commenced phase in with\n25% of the impact (net of\ndeferred taxes) recognized on\nJanuary 1, 2022, with an\nadditional 25% to be\nrecognized on the first day of\neach subsequent year through\nJanuary 1, 2025. In addition,\n25% of the build (pretax) made\nin 2020 and 2021 was deferred\nand is being amortized over\nthe same timeframe. See Notes\n1 and 14 for a further\ndescription of the ACL and\nrelated accounts. Goodwill\nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually as of July\n1 (the annual test) and\nthrough interim assessments\nbetween annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more-likely-\nthan-not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its\ncarrying amount, such as a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsignificant decline in Citi\u2019s\nstock price. Citi performed\ninterim goodwill impairment\ntests as a result of the\npreviously discussed changes\nin operating segments and\nreporting units during the\nfirst quarter of 2022. The\ntests resulted in an\nimpairment of $535 million to\nthe Asia Consumer reporting\nunit within Legacy Franchises\n, due to implementation of\nCiti\u2019s operating segment and\nreporting unit changes in the\nfirst quarter of 2022, as well\nas the timing of the entry\ninto its Asia consumer banking\nbusiness sale agreements.\nBased on the interim\nimpairment tests, the fair\nvalue of Citi\u2019s other\nreporting units as a\npercentage of their allocated\ncarrying values ranged from\napproximately 114% to 267%,\nresulting in no further\nimpairment recognized as of\nMarch 31, 2022. While the\ninherent risk related to\nuncertainty is embedded in the\nkey assumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as management\nimplements its strategic\nrefresh. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimate of key\neconomic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture.

Of Citi\u2019s $26.7\nbillion of net DTAs, $15.4\nbillion was not deducted in\ncalculating regulatory\ncapital, and was appropriately\nrisk weighted under the Basel\nIII rules. The remaining $11.3\nbillion (compared to $9.5\nbillion at December 31, 2021)\nwas deducted in calculating\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital. Of\nthe $11.3 billion, Citi had\n$11.7 billion related to tax\ncarry-forward DTAs, reduced by\nnet deferred tax liabilities\n(DTLs) of $1.6 billion (for a\nnet deduction of $10.1\nbillion). The $1.6 billion of\nnet DTLs was primarily\nassociated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible\nassets that are separately\ndeducted from capital. In\naddition, net DTAs arising\nfrom temporary differences are\ndeducted from regulatory\ncapital if in excess of the\n10%/15% limitations. Citi had\n$1.2 billion of such DTAs\nexcluded from regulatory\ncapital at March 31, 2022\n(compared to no such DTAs at\nDecember 31, 2021), primarily\ndue to tax benefits on losses\nin Other comprehensive income\n. DTA Realizability Citi\nbelieves that the realization\nof the recognized net DTAs of\n$26.7 billion at March 31,\n2022 is more-likely-than-not\nbased on management\u2019s\nexpectations of future taxable\nincome generation in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\nconsideration of available tax\nplanning strategies (as\ndefined in ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes ). Effective Tax\nRate Citi\u2019s reported effective\ntax rate for the first quarter\nof 2022 was approximately 18%,\ncompared to the first quarter\nof 2021 effective tax rate of\n23%. The decline in the\neffective tax rate reflected\nthe resolution of certain tax\naudit items during the current\nquarter.\n                               74                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nMarch 31, 2022. Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO\nhave concluded that at that\ndate Citigroup\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were\neffective.\n\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION\n219 OF THE IRAN THREAT\nREDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN\nRIGHTS ACT\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the\nIran Threat Reduction and\nSyria Human Rights Act of 2012\n(Section 219), which added\nSection 13(r) to the\nSecurities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, Citi is\nrequired to disclose in its\nannual or quarterly reports,\nas applicable, whether it or\nany of its affiliates\nknowingly engaged in certain\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings relating to Iran or\nwith certain individuals or\nentities that are the subject\nof sanctions under U.S. law.\nDisclosure is generally\nrequired even where the\nactivities, transactions or\ndealings were conducted in\ncompliance with applicable\nlaw.\n\nDuring the first quarter of\n2022, Citigroup processed two\ntransactions that were\nreportable pursuant to Section\n219. On February 16, 2022,\nCitibank Europe plc processed\na payment from an individual\nto the Iranian Embassy in\nLondon for visa-related fees,\nwhich is exempt pursuant to\nthe travel exemption of the\nIranian Transactions and\nSanctions Regulations. The\ntotal value of the payment was\nGBP 5.00 (approximately USD\n6.56). In addition, in January\n2022, two subsidiaries of\nCitigroup Inc. processed a\ntransaction between the\nCentral Bank of Iran (the CBI)\nand an international\norganization (IO). The CBI\nsent funds to the IO\u2019s Korean\nwon account at Citibank Korea\nInc., which were then\nconverted to U.S. dollars and\ntransferred to the IO\u2019s U.S.\ndollar account at Citibank,\nN.A., New York branch. The\ntotal value of the payment was\napproximately USD\n18,581,402.08.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of March 31,\n2022 and for the three-month\nperiods ended March 31, 2022\nand 2021 include the accounts\nof Citigroup Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries. In\nthe opinion of management, all\nadjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded in Citigroup\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31,\n2021 (2021 Form 10-K). Certain\nfinancial information that is\nnormally included in annual\nfinancial statements prepared\nin accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP), but is not\nrequired for interim reporting\npurposes, has been condensed\nor omitted. Management must\nmake estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the\nrelated footnote disclosures.\nWhile management uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT\nACCOUNTING POLICIES See Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2021\nForm 10-K for a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies.\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting\nfor Deposit Insurance Expenses\nDuring the fourth quarter of\n2021, Citi changed its\npresentation of accounting for\ndeposit insurance costs paid\nto the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC)\nand similar foreign\nregulators. These costs were\npreviously presented within\nInterest expense and, as a\nresult of this change, are now\npresented within Other\noperating expenses . Citi\nconcluded that this\npresentation was preferable in\nCiti\u2019s circumstances, as it\nbetter reflected the nature of\nthese deposit insurance costs\nin that these costs do not\ndirectly represent interest\npayments to creditors, but are\nsimilar in nature to other\npayments to regulatory\nagencies that are accounted\nfor as operating expenses.\n\nThis change in income\nstatement presentation\nrepresents a \u201cchange in\naccounting principle\u201d under\nASC Topic 250, Accounting\nChanges and Error Corrections\n, with retrospective\napplication to the earliest\nperiod presented. This change\nin accounting principle\nresulted in a reclassification\nof $ 340million of deposit\ninsurance expenses from\nInterest expense to Other\noperating expenses , for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2021.\nThis change had no impact on\nCiti\u2019s net income or the total\ndeposit insurance expense\nincurred by Citi. FUTURE\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Obligations\nto Safeguard Crypto-assets\nHeld for Platform Users In\nMarch 2022, the SEC issued\nStaff Accounting Bulletin\n(SAB) No. 121, which expresses\nthe views of the SEC staff\nregarding the accounting for\nobligations to safeguard\ncrypto-assets an entity holds\nfor platform users.\nSpecifically, the guidance\nrequires issuers that hold\ndigital assets for their\nplatform users to recognize a\nliability for their obligation\nto safeguard the digital\nassets held and a\ncorresponding asset, measured\ninitially and subsequently at\nfair value. The guidance is\neffective for interim and\nannual periods ending after\nJune 15, 2022, with\nretrospective application to\nthe beginning of the fiscal\nyear, with early adoption\npermitted. Citi is currently\nassessing the application of\nSAB 121, but based on its\ncurrent activity does not\nexpect any impact to its\nresults of operations as a\nresult of adopting SAB 121.\nFair Value Hedging\u2014Portfolio\nLayer Method In March 2022,\nthe FASB issued ASU No.\n2022-01, Derivatives and\nHedging (Topic 815): Fair\nValue Hedging\u2014Portfolio Layer\nMethod , intended to better\nalign hedge accounting with an\norganization\u2019s risk management\nstrategies. Specifically, the\nguidance expands the current\nsingle-layer method to allow\nmultiple hedge layers of a\nsingle closed portfolio of\nqualifying assets, which\ninclude both prepayable and\nnon-prepayable assets. Upon\nthe adoption of the guidance,\nentities may elect to\nreclassify securities held-to-\nmaturity to the available-for-\nsale category as long as the\nreclassified securities are\ndesignated in a portfolio\nhedge. The guidance is\neffective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15,\n2022, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years with\nearly adoption permitted. Citi\nis evaluating when to adopt\nthe amendments in ASU 2022-01.\nCiti does not expect a\nmaterial impact to its results\nof operations as a result of\nadopting the amendments.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nand Vintage Disclosures In\nMarch 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures . The ASU\neliminates the accounting\nguidance for troubled debt\nrestructurings by creditors,\nenhances disclosure\nrequirements for certain loan\nrefinancings and\nrestructurings by creditors\nand requires that an entity\ndisclose current-period gross\nwrite-offs by year of\norigination for financing\nreceivables and net\ninvestments in\n                               87                               \nleases within the scope of\nSubtopic 326-20. The guidance\nis effective beginning January\n1, 2023 and early adoption is\npermitted. Citi is evaluating\nwhether to early adopt and the\neffect that ASU 2022-02 will\nhave on its Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and\nrelated disclosures. Long-\nDuration Insurance Contracts\nIn August 2018, the FASB\nissued ASU No. 2018-12,\nFinancial Services\u2014Insurance:\nTargeted Improvements to the\nAccounting for Long-Duration\nContracts , which changes the\nexisting recognition,\nmeasurement, presentation and\ndisclosures for long-duration\ncontracts issued by an\ninsurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i)\nimproves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the\nliability for future policy\nbenefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future\ncash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the\naccounting for certain market-\nbased options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or\naccount balance) contracts,\n(iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred\nacquisition costs and (iv)\nintroduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries,\nprimarily in Mexico, that\nissue long-duration insurance\ncontracts such as traditional\nlife insurance policies and\nlife-contingent annuity\ncontracts that will be\nimpacted by the requirements\nof ASU 2018-12. The effective\ndate of ASU 2018-12 was\ndeferred for all insurance\nentities by ASU 2019-09,\nFinancial Services\u2014Insurance:\nEffective Date (issued in\nOctober 2019) and by ASU\n2020-11, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate and Early Application\n(issued in November 2020).\nCiti plans to adopt the\ntargeted improvements in ASU\n2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and\nis currently evaluating the\nimpact of the standard on its\ninsurance subsidiaries. Citi\ndoes not expect a material\nimpact to its results of\noperations as a result of\nadopting the standard.\n\n2.

In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, Citi\nrecognized an aggregate pretax loss on sale of approximately $\n700million ($ 600million after-tax), subject to closing\nadjustments. The loss on sale primarily reflects the impact of a\npretax $ 625million currency translation adjustment (CTA) loss\n(net of hedges) ($ 475million after-tax) already reflected in\nthe Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) component of\nequity. Upon closing, the CTA-related balance will be removed\nfrom the AOCI component of equity, resulting in a neutral CTA\nimpact to Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. In the first\nquarter of 2022, Citi recorded an additional pretax loss on sale\nof approximately $ 118million recorded in Other revenue ($\n81million after-tax), primarily reflecting the impact of a\npretax ACL release of $ 104million and contractual adjustments\nof $ 14million.\n\n(5) These sales are expected to result in an after-tax gain upon\nclosing.\n\nCiti did not have any other significant disposals to report as\nof March 31, 2022. As of May 9, 2022, Citi had not entered into\nany other definitive sales agreements related to its recently\nannounced intention to pursue exits of its consumer franchises\nin 13 markets across Asia and EMEA.

Other Business Exits Wind-\nDown of Korea Consumer Banking Business On October 25, 2021,\nCiti announced its decision to wind down and close its Korea\nconsumer banking business, which is reported in the Legacy\nFranchises operating segment. In connection with the\nannouncement, Citibank Korea Inc. (CKI) commenced a voluntary\nearly termination program (Korea VERP).

have certain partner-\nsharing agreements that vary by partner. These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses.

global discount rates.\n(2) Gains due to settlement and curtailment relate to\ndivestiture activities.\n(3) The U.S. qualified pension plan is fully funded under\nspecified Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as\namended (ERISA), funding rules as of January 1, 2022 and no\nminimum required funding is expected for 2022.\n(4) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n(5) The framework for the Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n                               96

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 14 for further\ninformation.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value, as described in Notes 20 and 21. The\nremaining portion is carried at the amount of cash initially\nadvanced or received, plus accrued interest, as specified in the\nrespective agreements. A substantial portion of securities\nborrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of\ncash advanced or received. The remaining portion is recorded at\nfair value as the Company elected the fair value option for\ncertain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios, as described\nin Note 21. With respect to securities loaned, the Company\nreceives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the\nmarket value of the securities loaned. The Company monitors the\nmarket value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a\ndaily basis and posts or obtains additional collateral in order\nto maintain contractual margin protection. The following tables\npresent the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and\nsecurities borrowing and lending agreements and the related\noffsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables\nalso include amounts related to financial instruments that are\nnot permitted to be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be\neligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default\nhas occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of\nthe offsetting rights has been obtained. Remaining exposures\ncontinue to be secured by financial collateral, but the Company\nmay not have sought or been able to obtain a legal opinion\nevidencing enforceability of the offsetting right.\n

There\nwere no purchased credit-deteriorated HTM debt securities held\nby the Company as of March 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.\n                              109                               \nEvaluating Investments for Impairment AFS Debt Securities\nOverview\u2014AFS Debt Securities The Company conducts periodic\nreviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized losses to\nevaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit\nlosses or from other factors and to evaluate the Company\u2019s\nintent to sell such securities. An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The sections below describe\nthe Company\u2019s process for identifying expected credit\nimpairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of March 31, 2022. Mortgage-\nBacked Securities Citi records no allowances for credit losses\non U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities,\nbecause the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the\nevent of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses\nand due to the nature of the counterparties. State and Municipal\nSecurities For AFS state and municipal bonds with unrealized\nlosses that Citi plans to sell or would more-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell, the full impairment is recognized in earnings.\nFor AFS state and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to\nsell and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be\nrequired to sell, Citi records an allowance for expected credit\nlosses for the amount it expects not to collect, capped at the\ndifference between the bond\u2019s amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue. Equity Method Investments For impaired equity method\ninvestments that Citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value\nor would more-likely-than-not be required to sell, with no\nexpectation that the fair value will recover prior to the\nexpected sale date, the full impairment is recognized as OTTI in\nOther revenue regardless of severity and duration. The\nmeasurement of the OTTI does not include partial projected\nrecoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date. For impaired\nequity method investments that management does not plan to sell\nand is not more-likely-than-not to be required to sell prior to\nrecovery of value, the evaluation of whether an impairment is\nother-than-temporary is based on (i) whether and when an equity\nmethod investment will recover in value and (ii) whether the\ninvestor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for\na period of time sufficient to recover the value.

at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired. For\ndetails on impairment\nindicators that are\nconsidered, see Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K. When the qualitative\nassessment indicates that\nimpairment exists, the\ninvestment is written down to\nfair value, with the full\ndifference between the fair\nvalue of the investment and\nits carrying amount recognized\nin earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                    March 31, 2022               2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value          $           1,622    $         1,413  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                        Three Months Ended             \n  Measurement                             March 31,             \n  alternative:(1)                              2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impairment losses        $                      \u2014    $     \u2014  \n  Downward changes for                            \u2014          \u2014  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                             85         81  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 for additional information on these nonrecurring\nfair value measurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                        March 31, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                           80  \n  Downward changes for                                       3  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       776  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

principal payments. Because forgiveness of\nprincipal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically\nhave little to no impact on the loans\u2019 projected cash flows and\nthus little to no impact on the allowance established for the\nloans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be\nrecorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already\nbeen recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is\nrequired at the time of the modification.\n(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest\npayments may involve a below-market interest rate.\nThe following table presents total corporate loans modified in a\nTDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the\npayment default occurred within one yearof a permanent\nmodification. Default is defined as 60days past due, except for\nclassifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is\ndefined as 90days past due.\n                                                                \n                          TDR                      TDR          \n                          loans                  loans          \n                          that                    that          \n                          re-de\u2026                re-de\u2026          \n                          in                        in          \n                TDR       2022      TDR           2021          \n              bala\u2026       within    bala\u2026       within          \n  In\u00a0            at       one       at             one          \n  mill\u2026       March       year      March         year          \n  of\u00a0           31,       of        31,             of          \n  doll\u2026        2022       modif\u2026    2021        modif\u2026          \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comm\u2026                                                         \n  and      $    205    $  \u2014                  $     283    $  \u2014  \n  indu\u2026                                                         \n  Mort\u2026                                                         \n  and            20       \u2014                         25       \u2014  \n  real                                                          \n  esta\u2026                                                         \n  Other          23       \u2014                         27       \u2014  \n  Tota\u2026    $    248    $  \u2014                  $     335    $  \u2014  \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding that\nwere considered TDRs as of the end of the reporting period.\n                              119                               \n                                                                \n  Consumer Loans                                                \n                                                                \nConsumer loans represent loans\nand leases managed primarily\nby PBWM and Legacy Franchises\n, except Mexico SBMM.\nConsumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Status at March\n31, 2022\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(2) Includes $ 10million of residential first mortgages recorded\nat fair value.\n(3) Excludes loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored\nagencies.

The results of the 2021 annual\nimpairment test resulted in no impairment. As discussed in Note\n3, effective January 1, 2022, as part of its strategic refresh,\nCiti made changes to its management structure, which resulted in\nchanges in its operating segments and reporting units to reflect\nhow the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker, intends\nto manage the Company, allocate resources and measure\nperformance. Goodwill balances were reallocated across the new\nreporting units based on their relative fair values using the\nvaluation performed as of the effective date of the\nreorganization. Further, the Goodwill balances associated with\ncertain Asia Consumer businesses within the Legacy Franchises\noperating segment were reclassified to HFS as of March 31, 2022.\nSee Note 2 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s divestiture activities.\nThe reorganization of Citi\u2019s reporting structure and the\nannounced sales of businesses within a reporting unit were\nidentified as triggering events for purposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. Consistent with the requirements of ASC 350,\ninterim goodwill impairment tests were performed that resulted\nin an impairment of $ 535million to the Asia Consumer reporting\nunit within the Legacy Franchises operating segment, due to the\nimplementation of Citi\u2019s revised operating segments and\nreporting units, as well as the timing of the announced sales of\nits Asia consumer banking businesses. This impairment was\nrecorded in the first quarter of 2022 as an operating expense.\nTo determine the goodwill impairment, Citi used a combination of\nthe income approach, market approach and bids from buyers, where\navailable, to determine the fair value of the Asia Consumer\nreporting unit. Under the market approach, Citi estimated fair\nvalue by comparing the business to similar businesses or\nguideline companies whose securities are actively traded in\npublic markets. Under the income approach, Citi used a\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model in which cash flows anticipated\nover several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that\ntime horizon, are discounted to their present value using an\nappropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent\nwithin the reporting unit. The key assumptions used to determine\nthe fair value of the Asia Consumer reporting unit consisted\nprimarily of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value\ninputs), including discount rates, estimated cash flows, growth\nrates, earnings multiples and/or transaction multiples of\nsimilar businesses or guideline public companies, and bids from\nbuyers. The DCF method employs a capital asset pricing model in\nestimating the discount rate based on several factors including\nmarket interest rates, and includes adjustments for market risk\nand company-specific risk. Estimated cash flows are based on\ninternally developed estimates and the growth rates are based on\nindustry knowledge and historical performance. Based on the\ninterim impairment tests, the fair values of all of Citi\u2019s other\nreporting units as a percentage of their allocated carrying\nvalues ranged from approximately 114% to 267%, resulting in no\nfurther impairment recognized as of March 31, 2022. While the\ninherent risk of uncertainty is embedded in the key assumptions\nused in the valuations, the economic and business environments\ncontinue to evolve as management implements its strategic\nrefresh. If management\u2019s future estimate of key economic and\nmarket assumptions were to differ from its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially experience material goodwill impairment\ncharges in the future.

significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 100billion and $\n100billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 498million and $\n497million in maximum exposure to loss as of March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n                              137                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $\n54.8billion and $ 55.6billion, respectively (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Note 13 and Note 26 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Citigroup\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the\nCompany holds securities in inventory, as these investments are\nmade on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and\nasset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and\n20 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have\na variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              138                               \nFunding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated\nVIEs\u2014Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments\nThe following table presents the notional amount of liquidity\nfacilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding\ncommitments in the VIE tables above:\n                                                                \n                 March                    Decemb\u2026               \n                   31,                        31,               \n                  2022                       2021               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  milli\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026  \n  of           facili\u2026       commi\u2026       facili\u2026       commi\u2026  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Non-a\u2026                                                        \n  mortg\u2026    $        \u2014    $      11    $        \u2014    $       5  \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  Asset\u2026             \u2014       12,288             \u2014       12,189  \n  finan\u2026                                                        \n  Munic\u2026                                                        \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  tender                                                        \n  option         1,736            \u2014         1,498            \u2014  \n  bond                                                          \n  trusts                                                        \n  (TOBs)                                                        \n  Munic\u2026             \u2014        3,821             \u2014        3,562  \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  Inves\u2026             \u2014           15             \u2014           12  \n  funds                                                         \n  Other              \u2014            \u2014             \u2014            \u2014  \n  Total                                                         \n  fundi\u2026    $    1,736    $  16,135    $    1,498    $  15,768  \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                March 31, 2022                   2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash                $               \u2014    $                 \u2014  \n  Trading account                   1.4                    1.4  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                       8.8                    8.8  \n  Total loans, net                 37.6                   35.4  \n  of allowance                                                  \n  Other                             1.0                    0.8  \n  Total assets        $            48.8    $              46.4  \n                                                                \nCredit Card Securitizations\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s credit card securitization\nactivity is through twotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust\n(Master Trust) and Citibank Omni Trust (Omni Trust), with the\nsubstantial majority through the Master Trust.

In managing this\nrisk, Citigroup economically\nhedges a significant portion\nof the value of its MSRs\nthrough the use of interest\nrate derivative contracts,\nforward purchase and sale\ncommitments of mortgage-backed\nsecurities and purchased\nsecurities, all classified as\nTrading account assets .

Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021. These\nsecurities are backed by\neither residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of\nclients. As of March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, Citi\nheld noretained interests in\nprivate label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During\nthe three months ended March\n31, 2022, Citi transferred\nagency securities with a fair\nvalue of approximately $\n9.3billion to re-\nsecuritization entities,\ncompared to approximately $\n13.1billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2021.\nAs of March 31, 2022, the fair\nvalue of Citi-retained\ninterests in agency re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.2billion\n(including $ 300million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2022)\nunchanged from to $ 1.2billion\nas of December 31, 2021\n(including $ 641million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in\n2021), which is recorded in\nTrading account assets . The\noriginal fair values of agency\nre-securitization transactions\nin which Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021 were\napproximately $ 80.3billion\nand $ 78.4billion,\nrespectively. As of March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021,\nthe Company did not\nconsolidate any private label\nor agency re-securitization\nentities. Citi-Administered\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper\nConduits At March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the\ncommercial paper conduits\nadministered by Citi had\napproximately $ 13.6billion\nand $ 14billion of purchased\nassets outstanding,\nrespectively, and had\nincremental funding\ncommitments with clients of\napproximately $ 16.7billion\nand $ 18.3billion,\nrespectively. Substantially\nall of the funding of the\nconduits is in the form of\nshort-term commercial paper.\nAt March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, the weighted average\nremaining lives of the\ncommercial paper issued by the\nconduits were approximately\n63and 70days, respectively.\nThe primary credit enhancement\nprovided to the conduit\ninvestors is in the form of\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancements described above.\nEach asset purchased by the\nconduit is structured with\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancement features provided\nby the third-party client\nseller, including over-\ncollateralization, cash and\nexcess spread collateral\naccounts, direct recourse or\nthird-party guarantees. These\ncredit enhancements are sized\nwith the objective of\napproximating a credit rating\nof A or above, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. In\naddition to the transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements,\nthe conduits, other than the\ngovernment-guaranteed loan\nconduit, have obtained letters\nof credit from the Company,\nwhich equal at least 8% to 10%\nof the conduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The\nletters of credit\n\nprovided by the Company to the\nconduits total approximately $\n1.2billion and $ 1.3billion as\nof March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively. The\nnet result across multi-seller\nconduits administered by the\nCompany is that, in the event\nthat defaulted assets exceed\nthe transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements described\nabove, any losses in each\nconduit are allocated first to\nthe Company and then to the\ncommercial paper investors. At\nMarch 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, the Company owned $\n4.5billion and $ 4.9billion,\nrespectively, of the\ncommercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits. The\nCompany\u2019s investments were not\ndriven by market illiquidity\nand the Company is not\nobligated under any agreement\nto purchase the commercial\npaper issued by the conduits.\nCollateralized Loan\nObligations (CLOs) There were\nno new securitizations during\nthe three months ended March\n31, 2022 and 2021.

At\nMarch 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, liquidity agreements\nprovided with respect to\ncustomer TOB trusts totaled $\n1.8billion and $ 1.5billion,\nrespectively, of which $\n0.8billion and $ 0.6billion,\nrespectively, were offset by\nreimbursement agreements. For\nthe remaining exposure related\nto TOB transactions, where the\nresidual owned by the customer\nwas at least 25% of the bond\nvalue at the inception of the\ntransaction, no reimbursement\nagreement was executed.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining\nto Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e.,\nmarket risk), counterparty\nfailure (i.e., credit risk)\nand/or periods of high\nvolatility or financial stress\n(i.e., liquidity risk), as\nwell as any market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n

a\n\u201creference asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              146                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of March\n31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against\ngross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to\nenforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. As a\nresult, the tables reflect a\nreduction of approximately $\n430billion and $ 340billion as\nof March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, respectively, of\nderivative assets and\nderivative liabilities that\npreviously would have been\nreported on a gross basis, but\nare now legally settled and\nnot subject to collateral. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              147

For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\nCitigroup has executed a last-\nof-layer hedge, which permits\nan entity to hedge the\ninterest rate risk of a stated\nportion of a closed portfolio\nof prepayable financial assets\nthat are expected to remain\noutstanding for the designated\ntenor of the hedge. In\naccordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment\nrisk when measuring the change\nin fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk under the last-of-\nlayer approach. Similar to\nother fair value hedges, where\nthe hedged item is an asset,\nthe fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk will be presented in\nInterest revenue along with\nthe change in the fair value\nof the hedging instrument.\n\nHedging of Foreign Exchange\nRisk Citigroup hedges the\nchange in fair value\nattributable to foreign\nexchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt\nthat are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the\nentity holding the securities\nor issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nCitigroup considers the\npremium associated with\nforward contracts (i.e., the\ndifferential between the spot\nand contractual forward rates)\nas the cost of hedging; this\namount is excluded from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally\nreflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge.\nCiti also excludes changes in\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the value\nof the hedged inventory is\nreflected in earnings, which\noffsets the change in the fair\nvalue of the futures contract\nthat is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedging instrument recorded in\nearnings includes changes in\nforward rates, Citigroup\nexcludes the differential\nbetween the spot and the\ncontractual forward rates\nunder the futures contract\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, and it is\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in forward rates from\nthe assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income.\n                              150

These cash flow hedging relationships\nuse either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis\nto assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective\nat inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of March 31, 2022 is\napproximately $ 200million. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10years. The pretax\nchange in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below.

settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nwas $ 19billion and $\n19billion, respectively. The\nCompany posted $ 16billion and\n$ 16billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of March\n31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger\nadditional collateral or cash\nsettlement requirements for\nthe Company and certain\naffiliates. In the event that\nCitigroup and Citibank were\ndowngraded a single notch by\nall threemajor rating agencies\nas of March 31, 2022, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n1.6billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 0.1billion upon the\nsingle notch downgrade,\nresulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$ 1.7billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nboth the asset amounts\nderecognized and the gross\ncash proceeds received as of\nthe date of derecognition were\n$ 0.8billion and $ 2.9billion\nas of March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021,\nrespectively. At March 31,\n2022, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 0.8billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of March 31, 2022 was\n$ 30million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n5million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2021, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.9billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 13million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n58million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              155                               \n20.

These two types of\ninputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level\n1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active and model-derived valuations in\nwhich all significant inputs and significant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable . As required under\nthe fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and\nobservable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The\nfair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes\nrules-based and data-driven selection criteria to determine\nwhether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level\n3: \u2022 The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is\nbased upon the frequency of observed transactions and the\nquality of independent market data available on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is\nobservability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The\ndetermination of whether an input is considered observable is\nbased on the availability of independent market data and its\ncorroboration, for example through observed transactions in the\nmarket. \u2022 Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.\n                              156                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis The\nfollowing tables present for\neach of the fair value\nhierarchy levels the Company\u2019s\nassets and liabilities that\nare measured at fair value on\na recurring basis at March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021.\nThe Company may hedge\npositions\n\nthat have been classified in\nthe Level 3 category with\nother financial instruments\n(hedging instruments) that may\nbe classified as Level 3, but\nalso with financial\ninstruments classified as\nLevel 1 or Level 2.

The gains and losses\npresented below include changes in the fair value related to\nboth observable and unobservable inputs. The Company often\nhedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified\nin a different level. For example, the gains and losses for\nassets and liabilities in the Level 3 category presented in the\ntables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and\ngains on hedging instruments that may be classified in the Level\n1 or Level 2 categories. In addition, the Company hedges items\nclassified in the Level 3 category with instruments also\nclassified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

This\nhas primarily resulted in $\n0.9billion of certain\nstructured long-term debt\nproducts being transferred\nfrom Level 3 to Level 2 during\nthe three months ended March\n31, 2022.

See Notes 17 and 20.\n                              171                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . Among other\nvariables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and\nsimilar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of\nthe Company\u2019s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair\nvalue of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in\nthe Company\u2019s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit\nrisk) were a gain of $ 1,050million and a loss of $ 38million\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in\ninstrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating\nthe Company\u2019s current credit spreads observable in the bond\nmarket into the relevant valuation technique used to value each\nliability as described above. The Fair Value Option for\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities Selected Portfolios\nof Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities\nBorrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase,\nSecurities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term\nBorrowings The Company elected the fair value option for certain\nportfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements\nto resell and fixed income securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain\nuncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-\ndealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and\nJapan. In each case, the election was made because the related\ninterest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily\nwith offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at\nfair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for\ntransactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal\ntransactions . The related interest revenue and interest expense\nare measured based on the contractual rates specified in the\ntransactions and are reported as Interest revenue and Interest\nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans\nand Other Credit Products Citigroup has also elected the fair\nvalue option for certain other originated and purchased loans,\nincluding certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and\nletters of credit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading\nbusinesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged\nfinancing commitments. Significant groups of transactions\ninclude loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be\neither sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions\nwhere the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments,\nsuch as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps\nwhere the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans\nto a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to\nmitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting\nis complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair\nvalue was not elected for most lending transactions across the\nCompany.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                                           Decemb\u2026              \n                   March                       31,              \n                31, 2022                      2021              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026        Trading       Loans       Trading       Loans  \n  of              assets                    assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $     8,798    $  5,732    $    9,530    $  6,082  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess             113         195          -100         226  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                \u2014         266             \u2014           1  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                \u2014           \u2014             \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              172                               \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 713million and $\n719million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Changes\nin the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are\nclassified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended March 31, 2022\nand 2021 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to\nlosses of $( 59) million and $( 2) million, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals Citigroup\ninvests in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver,\nplatinum and palladium) as part of its commodity and foreign\ncurrency trading activities or to economically hedge certain\nexposures from issuing structured liabilities. Under ASC 815,\nthe investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a\ncommodity forward derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the\nfair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the\ndebt host contract within Trading account assets on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount\nof debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals\naccounts was approximately $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion at\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The amounts\nare expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in future\nperiods. As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading\nactivities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments\nand executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative\ncontracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an\nunallocated precious metals investment, Citi\u2019s receivable from\nits depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its\ninvestment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward\npurchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed\nto unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative,\nat fair value through earnings. As of March 31, 2022, there were\napproximately $ 23.6billion and $ 14.4billion of notional\namounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative\ncontracts outstanding, respectively. Certain Investments in\nPrivate Equity and Real Estate Ventures Citigroup invests in\nprivate equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of\nearning investment returns and for capital appreciation. The\nCompany has elected the fair value option for certain of these\nventures, because such investments are considered similar to\nmany private equity or hedge fund activities in Citi\u2019s\ninvestment companies, which are reported at fair value.

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be $ 112billion and $\n119billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants.\n                              175                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 18million and $ 19million at March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and these amounts\nare included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of\nits credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide insurance coverage for rental\ncars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased\nproducts, price protection for certain purchases and protection\nfor lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the\ntable, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the\nactual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of\nCiti\u2019s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of March 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification\nThrough reinsurance agreements and a long-term care\nindemnification with Genworth Financial Inc. for what are\npresently referred to as the Genworth Trusts, and only as a\nresult of two unlikely events, Citi would be responsible for an\nindemnification obligation. Since the likelihood of such events\noccurring is currently not probable, there is no liability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021 related to this indemnification. However,\nif both events become reasonably possible (meaning more than\nremote but less than probable), Citi will be required to\nestimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of\nloss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In\naddition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required\nto accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable\naccounting principles. Citi continues to closely monitor its\npotential exposure under this indemnification obligation. For\nadditional information, see Note 26 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K. Futures and Over-\nthe-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services\non central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts\nwith CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi\nhas concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes\nin its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 19 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has\n                              176                               \ncontractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 19.8billion and $ 18.7billion as of March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Variation margin due\nfrom clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients,\nreflects changes in the value of the client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is\nexposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure\nof a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In\nthe event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to\nclose out the client\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically\nutilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP,\nwith any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as\nclearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or\nsecurities margin posted by the client, which would typically be\nexpected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the\nevent the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.5billion and $\n1.4billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 62.9billion and $\n56.5billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 85.3billion and $ 84.2billion at March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities\nlending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in\nfavor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 3.8billion and $\n4.1billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to\ncover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications;\nhowever, the value of such property has not been determined.\n                              177                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

Unsettled Reverse\nRepurchase and Securities\nBorrowing Agreements and\nUnsettled Repurchase and\nSecurities Lending Agreements\nIn addition, in the normal\ncourse of business, Citigroup\nenters into reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nMarch 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, Citigroup had\napproximately $ 153.0billion\nand $ 126.6billion of\nunsettled reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, and approximately\n$ 48.6billion and $\n41.1billion of unsettled\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements,\nrespectively.

For purposes\nof this Note, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory, or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At March 31,\n2022, Citigroup estimates that\nthe reasonably possible\nunaccrued loss for these\nmatters ranges up to\napproximately $ 1.4billion in\nthe aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is\nable to estimate will change,\nand the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition,\nwhile many estimates presented\nin financial statements and\nother financial disclosures\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of\nreasonably possible loss\narising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued in\nrelation to matters for which\nan estimate has been made\ncould be substantially higher\nor lower than the range of\nloss included in the estimate.\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters\ndescribed in this Note would\nnot be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse\n\noutcome in certain of these\nmatters could, from time to\ntime, have a material adverse\neffect on Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated results of\noperations or cash flows in\nparticular quarterly or annual\nperiods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2021 Form\n10-K.
