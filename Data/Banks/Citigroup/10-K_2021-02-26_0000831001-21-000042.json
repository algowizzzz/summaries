Citi commenced share\nrepurchases in February 2021.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to support\nits colleagues, customers,\nclients and communities as\nwell as the broader economy\nduring this challenging time\n(see \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOverview\u201d below), while\nmaintaining a strong balance\nsheet.\n\nThe economic outlook for 2021\nreflects continued challenges\nand uncertainties related to\nthe pandemic, including, among\nothers, the duration and\nseverity of the public health\ncrisis and associated economic\nimpacts, which have created a\nmore volatile operating\nenvironment that will continue\nto negatively impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses and results.\n\nAs a result of new information\nCiti received subsequent to\nDecember 31, 2020, Citi\nadjusted downward its fourth\nquarter\n\nof 2020 financial results from\nthose previously reported on\nJanuary 15, 2021 (and filed on\na Form 8-K with the SEC on\nsuch date), due to a $390\nmillion increase in operating\nexpenses ($323 million after-\ntax) recorded within ICG ,\nresulting from operational\nlosses related to certain\nlegal matters. For additional\ninformation on the impact to\nfourth quarter of 2020\nfinancial results, see Note 30\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition for the full year\n2020, as reported in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31,\n2020, reflect the impact of\nthis adjustment.\n\nFor a discussion of risks and\nuncertainties that will or\ncould impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition during 2021, see\n\u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Overview,\u201d\n\u201cRisk Factors,\u201d each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  2020 Results Summary                                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $11.0 billion, or $4.72 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $19.4 billion, or $8.04 per\nshare, in the prior year. Net\nincome declined 43%, driven by\nsignificantly higher credit\ncosts and higher expenses,\nwhile revenues remained\nlargely unchanged. Earnings\nper share decreased 41%,\nprimarily driven by the\ndecline in net income.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $74.3\nbillion were largely unchanged\nfrom the prior year, as higher\nrevenues in ICG offset lower\nrevenues in GCB and\nCorporate/Other .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans decreased 3% from the\nprior year to $676 billion.\nExcluding the impact of\nforeign currency translation\ninto U.S. dollars for\nreporting purposes (FX\ntranslation), Citigroup\u2019s end-\nof-period loans declined 4%,\ndriven by a 4% aggregate\ndecline in GCB and ICG ,\nreflecting lower spend\nactivity in GCB as well as a\nhigher level of repayments in\nboth GCB and ICG . Citigroup\u2019s\nend-of-period deposits\nincreased 20% to $1.3\ntrillion. Excluding the impact\nof FX translation, Citigroup\u2019s\nend-of-period deposits\nincreased 19%, primarily\ndriven by 18% growth in GCB\nand 19% growth in ICG .\n(Citi\u2019s results of operations\nexcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. Citi\nbelieves the presentation of\nits results of operations and\nfinancial condition excluding\nthe impact of FX translation\nprovides a meaningful\ndepiction of the underlying\nfundamentals of its businesses\nfor investors, industry\nanalysts and others.)\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup operating expenses\nof $43.2 billion increased 3%\nversus the prior year,\nprimarily driven by\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, including\ninfrastructure supporting its\nrisk and control environment,\nhigher compensation, the civil\nmoney penalty, operational\nlosses related to certain\nlegal matters and pandemic-\nrelated expenses, partially\noffset by efficiency savings\nand reductions in marketing\nand other discretionary\nspending.

Citi\u2019s ACL\nbuild of $9.8 billion was\nlargely driven by builds\nduring the first half of 2020.\nThe reserve build in 2020\nprimarily reflected the impact\nof a deterioration in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook under\nthe CECL standard and\ndowngrades in the corporate\nloan portfolio, partially\noffset by lower loan volumes\nin GCB , all driven by the\npandemic. The reserve build\nincluded an additional\nqualitative management\nadjustment to reflect the\npotential for a higher level\nof stress and a slower\neconomic recovery.

Consumer net\ncredit losses of $6.6 billion\ndecreased 10%, primarily\nreflecting lower loan volumes\ngiven lower spending activity\nand higher payment rates, as\nwell as the benefits of\nconsumer relief programs (see\n\u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Overview\u201d\nbelow). Corporate net credit\nlosses increased from $392\nmillion to $1.0 billion,\nprimarily driven by write-offs\nacross various sectors, which\nwere partially offset by the\nrelease of previously\nestablished ACL reserves.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs and ACL, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital ratio was 11.7% as\nof December 31, 2020, based on\nthe Basel III Advanced\nApproaches framework for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets, compared to 11.8% as\nof December 31, 2019, based on\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets. The decline\nin the ratio primarily\nreflected an increase in risk-\nweighted assets and the return\nof capital to common\nshareholders, partially offset\nby net income and beneficial\nnet movements in Accumulated\nother comprehensive income\n(AOCI).\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio was 7.0% as of\nDecember 31, 2020, compared to\n6.2% as of December 31, 2019.\nThe increase was primarily\ndriven by a decrease in Total\nLeverage Exposure, reflecting\nthe benefit of temporary\nrelief granted by the Federal\nReserve Board.

GCB operating\nexpenses of $17.2 billion\ndecreased 2%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nexpenses decreased 1%, as\nlower volume-\n\nrelated expenses, reductions\nin marketing and other\ndiscretionary spending and\nefficiency savings were\npartially offset by increases\nin pandemic-related expenses\nand higher repositioning\ncosts.\n\nGCB revenues of $30.0 billion\ndecreased 9%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues decreased 8%, as\nstrong deposit growth and\nmomentum in wealth management\nwere more than offset by lower\ncard volumes and lower\ninterest rates across all\nregions, reflecting the impact\nof the pandemic.\n\nNorth America GCB revenues of\n$19.1 billion decreased 6%,\nwith lower revenues across\nCiti-branded cards, Citi\nretail services and retail\nbanking. Citi-branded cards\nrevenues of $8.8 billion\ndecreased 4%, reflecting lower\npurchase sales and higher\npayment rates driving lower\naverage loans. Citi retail\nservices revenues of $5.9\nbillion decreased 12%,\nreflecting lower average loans\nas well as higher partner\npayments. Retail banking\nrevenues of $4.5 billion\ndecreased 2%, as the benefit\nof stronger deposit volumes\nand an improvement in mortgage\nrevenues were more than offset\nby lower deposit spreads.\n\nNorth America GCB average\ndeposits of $176 billion\nincreased 15% year-over-year,\naverage retail banking loans\nof $52 billion increased 8%\nyear-over-year and assets\nunder management of $80\nbillion increased 11%.

In addition, Citi\nhas offered a wide array of\nshort- and medium-term relief\nprograms to customers across\nregions and products as a\nresult of the pandemic. The\nrelief has primarily been in\nthe form of payment deferrals\nand fee waivers. These\nconsumer relief programs have\nmainly been provided to GCB\ncustomers, with a small\nportion reported within\nCorporate/Other . To date,\nCiti has provided assistance\nto approximately three million\nU.S. consumers and small\nbusinesses impacted by the\npandemic.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020,\nCiti experienced a decline in\nenrollment of approximately\n21% quarter-over-quarter in\nits formal COVID-19 assistance\nprograms. As a result of the\nsignificant and steady decline\nin enrollment, Citi ended the\nprograms as of December 31,\n2020 for the majority of\ncountries and products.\nContinued COVID-19 assistance\nprograms through Citi\u2019s\nsubservicer include extended\nmortgage payment deferrals\nthrough 2021 and suspended\nforeclosures into the first\nquarter of 2021 for U.S.\nmortgages.

Planning for Citi\u2019s return-to-\noffice strategy is ongoing. Citi\u2019s organizational response to\nthe pandemic has been governed by Citi\u2019s Executive Management\nTeam, consisting of the Citigroup CEO and certain direct reports\nof the CEO, and driven through regional task forces that were\ndeployed in Asia, EMEA , North America and Latin America . Led\nby regional CEOs and their management teams, these groups\nfocused on, and continue to manage, the pandemic responses,\nimplementation of continuity of business plans, locational and\nstaffing strategies and responses to customer and client needs.\nThroughout the crisis, Citi has also worked closely with U.S.\nauthorities and host governments on implementing immediate\npolicy responses and financial assistance structures to mitigate\nthe systemic impacts of the pandemic.

Citi has\nparticipated in several of the\nU.S. government-sponsored\nliquidity programs, including\nthe Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility (MMLF), the\nPrimary Dealer Credit Facility\n(PDCF) and Discount Window\n(DW) in order to facilitate\nclient activity and support\nthe FRB actions to provide\nadditional liquidity into the\nmarket.

Citi\u2019s\nreported Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio at December 31,\n2020, reflecting the modified\nCECL transition provision, was\n39 basis points\n                               12                               \nhigher than Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio,\nreflecting the full impact of\nCECL on regulatory capital.\nExcluding the modified CECL\ntransition provision,\nCitigroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital ratio would have\nbeen 11.34%, compared with a\n10.0% effective minimum\nrequirement.\n\n\u2022 Temporary Supplementary\nLeverage ratio (SLR) relief\nfor bank holding companies,\ncommencing in the second\nquarter of 2020, allowing\nCitigroup to temporarily\nexpand its balance sheet by\nexcluding U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits with\nthe FRB from the SLR\ndenominator. Citigroup\u2019s\nreported Supplementary\nLeverage ratio of 7.00%\nbenefited by 109 basis points\nduring the fourth quarter of\n2020 as a result of the\ntemporary relief. Excluding\nthe temporary relief,\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio would have been\n5.91%, co mpared with a 5.0%\neffective minimum requirement.\n\n\u2022 Assigning a 0% risk weight\nto loans originated under the\nPaycheck Protection Program.\n\nFor additional information\nabout regulatory capital\nrelief provided by the U.S.\nbanking agencies, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) Relief                      \n                                                                \nUnder U.S. GAAP, banks are\nrequired to assess\nmodifications to a loan\u2019s\nterms for potential\nclassification as a TDR. A\nloan to a borrower\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty is classified as a\nTDR when a lender grants a\nconcession that it would\notherwise not consider, such\nas a payment deferral or\ninterest concession.\n\nIn order to encourage banks to\nwork with impacted borrowers,\nthe Coronavirus Aid, Relief,\nand Economic Security Act\n(CARES Act) and U.S. banking\nagencies have provided relief\nfrom TDR accounting. The main\nbenefits of TDR relief include\na capital benefit in the form\nof reduced risk-weighted\nassets, as TDRs are more\nheavily risk-weighted for\ncapital purposes; aging of the\nloans is frozen, i.e., they\nwill continue to be reported\nin the same delinquency bucket\nthey were in at the time of\nmodification; and the loans\nare generally not reported as\nnon-accrual during the\nmodification period. The loans\nincluded in Citi\u2019s pandemic-\nrelated consumer relief\nprograms are included in\nCiti\u2019s reserving process under\nthe CECL standard.\n\nSmall Business\nAdministration\u2019s Paycheck\nProtection Program\n\nThe Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP) authorizes the\norigination of forgivable\nloans for small businesses to\npay their employees during the\npandemic. Loan terms are the\nsame for all businesses.\nDuring the first round of PPP,\nwhich was launched in April\n2020, Citi funded over 30,000\nloans totaling $3.8 billion as\nof December 31, 2020, with\napproximately $3.4 billion\noutstanding at December 31,\n2020. The processing of loan\nforgiveness requests under PPP\nbegan during the third quarter\nof 2020 and Citi received\napproximately $314 million of\nfunds from the SBA relating to\nforgiveness in the fourth\nquarter of 2020. Citi is\ncurrently participating in the\nrelaunch of PPP and remains\ncommitted to supporting small\nbusinesses.\n                                                                \n  Pandemic and Other Impacts                                    \n                                                                \nIn 2021, Citi expects overall\nrevenues to decline from 2020,\nlargely driven by\nnormalization in the ICG\nmarkets businesses. In\naddition, GCB , ICG and\nCorporate/Other revenues will\nlikely continue to be\nadversely impacted by the\nlower global interest rate\nenvironment, and GCB and ICG\nrevenues will be affected by\nthe challenges and\nuncertainties in the\nmacroeconomic and market\nenvironment, including as a\nresult of the continued\nseverity and duration of the\npandemic. Each GCB region is\nalso expected to continue to\nexperience the adverse impacts\nthe pandemic has had on\ncustomer activity, while Latin\nAmerica GCB is also likely to\ncontinue to experience an\nimpact from macroeconomic\nweakness in Mexico.\n\nCiti also expects to incur\nhigher expenses, as it\ncontinues to accelerate the\ntransformation of its\ninfrastructure, risk\nmanagement and controls,\nincluding its efforts to\nimprove the risk and control\nenvironment, as well as to\ncomply with the consent orders\n(see \u201cCiti\u2019s Consent Order\nCompliance\u201d above).\n\nMoreover, based on its\nexisting portfolios as of\nDecember 31, 2020, Citi\nexpects to experience higher\nnet credit losses, which will\nvary by business and region\nand be dependent on future\nmacroeconomic conditions. Citi\nbelieves that these losses are\nadequately reserved for under\nthe CECL standard at December\n31, 2020. Citi expects\ninternational consumer losses\nto peak during the first half\nof 2021, while in the U.S.,\nlosses could begin to rise in\n2021 but peak afterward. If\nCiti\u2019s fourth quarter of 2020\nmacroeconomic forecast\nassumptions are realized, Citi\nwould not expect additional\nreserve builds on its existing\nportfolios (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below);\nhowever, the overall level of\nreserves remains dependent on\nthe evolving economic and\npublic health environments\nrelative to this forecast, as\nwell as new lending volumes.\n\nFor additional information\nabout material risks to Citi\nfrom the pandemic and other\nmacroeconomic challenges

as\nsignificantly higher cost of\ncredit and lower revenues were\npartially offset by lower\nexpenses.\n\nRevenues decreased 6%,\nreflecting lower revenues in\nCiti retail services, Citi-\nbranded cards and retail\nbanking, primarily due to the\npandemic, including lower\ninterest rates.\n\nRetail banking revenues\ndecreased 2%, as the benefit\nof stronger deposit volumes\nand an improvement in mortgage\nrevenues were more than offset\nby lower deposit spreads,\nreflecting lower interest\nrates.\n\nAverage deposits increased\n15%, driven by a combination\nof factors, including\ngovernment stimulus payments,\na reduction in overall\nconsumer spending related to\nthe pandemic and strategic\nefforts to drive organic\ngrowth, including digital\ndeposits which drove more than\none-third of the year-over-\nyear growth.\n\nCards revenues decreased 7%.\nCiti-branded cards revenues\ndecreased 4%, reflecting lower\npurchase sales and higher\npayment rates driving lower\naverage loans. Average loans\ndecreased 6% and purchase\nsales decreased 8%, both\nreflecting the impact of the\npandemic on customer activity.\n\nCiti retail services revenues\ndecreased 12%, primarily\nreflecting lower average loans\nand higher contractual partner\npayments. (For additional\ninformation on partner\npayments, see Note 5 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.) Average loans\nwere down 7% and purchase\nsales declined 11%, both\nreflecting the impact of the\npandemic on customer activity.\n\nExpenses decreased 2%, as\nlower volume-related expenses,\nreductions in marketing and\nother discretionary expenses,\nas well as efficiency savings,\nmore than offset higher\npandemic-related expenses.\n\nProvisions of $9.1 billion\nincreased 50% from the prior\nyear, driven by a higher\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL) build, partially offset\nby lower net credit losses.\nNet credit losses decreased\n11%, primarily driven by lower\nnet credit losses in Citi\nretail services (down 16% to\n$2.2 billion) and Citi-branded\ncards (down 5% to $2.7\nbillion), primarily reflecting\nlower loan volumes as well as\nhigher payment rates given\nhigh levels of liquidity,\nlower spending and the\nbenefits of relief programs.\n\nThe ACL build of $4.1 billion\n(compared to a build of\n\n$470 million in the prior year\nunder prior accounting\n\nstandards) was driven by\nbuilds during the first half\nof 2020. The builds reflected\nthe impact of a deterioration\nin Citi\u2019s macroeconomic\noutlook under the CECL\nstandard, including an\nincrease in the qualitative\nmanagement adjustment to\nreflect the potential for a\nhigher level of stress and a\nslower economic recovery,\npartially offset by lower loan\nvolumes, both primarily driven\nby the pandemic.

Presentations of the results of operations, excluding\nthe impact of FX translation, are non-GAAP financial measures.\nFor a reconciliation of certain of these metrics to the reported\nresults, see the table above.\n                                                                \n  2020 vs. 2019                                                 \n                                                                \nNet income decreased 66%,\nreflecting lower revenues,\nhigher cost of credit and\nhigher expenses.\n\nRevenues decreased 8%,\nreflecting lower retail\nbanking and cards revenues,\nlargely due to the pandemic,\nincluding lower interest\nrates. Revenues also decreased\ndue to the ongoing slowdown in\noverall economic growth and\nindustry volumes in Mexico.\n\nRetail banking revenues\ndecreased 8%, driven by a\ndecline in loan volumes and\nlower deposit spreads,\npartially offset by deposit\ngrowth and an increase in\nassets under management.\nAverage deposits were up 10%,\nwhile average loans decreased\n5%, reflecting the impact of\nthe pandemic on customer\nactivity, as well as the\nongoing economic slowdown.\nAssets under management\nincreased 12%, including the\nbenefit of market movements.\n\nCards revenues decreased 10%,\nprimarily driven by lower\npurchase sales (down 17%) and\nlower average loans (down 8%),\nreflecting the impact of the\npandemic on customer activity\nand the ongoing economic\nslowdown.\n\nExpenses increased 4%, as\nefficiency savings were more\nthan offset by repositioning\ncosts, pandemic-related\nexpenses, and ongoing\ninvestment spending.\n\nProvisions of $1.3 billion\nincreased 26% from the prior\nyear, driven by a higher\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL) build, partially offset\nby lower net credit losses.\nNet credit losses decreased\n14%, primarily driven by lower\naverage loans and the impact\nof consumer relief programs.\n\nThe ACL build of $316 million\n(compared to a net reserve\nrelease of $35 million in the\nprior year under prior\naccounting standards) was\ndriven by builds during the\nfirst half of 2020. The builds\nreflected the impact of a\ndeterioration in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook under\nthe CECL standard, including\nan increase in the qualitative\nmanagement adjustment to\nreflect the potential for a\nhigher level of stress and a\nslower economic recovery,\npartially offset by lower loan\nvolumes, both primarily driven\nby the pandemic.

Average\ndeposits increased 11% and\naverage loans increased 5%.\nAssets under management\nincreased 5% and investment\nsales increased 43%. Retail\nlending revenues increased 4%,\nlargely reflecting growth in\nmortgages and personal loans,\npartially offset by spread\ncompression in personal loans.\n\nCards revenues decreased 24%,\nprimarily driven by lower\npurchase sales (down 16%) and\nlower average loans (down 8%),\nreflecting the impact of the\npandemic on customer activity,\nincluding from lower travel\nspend in the region given\nCiti\u2019s skew to an affluent\nclient base and a greater\nproportion of fee revenues\ncoming from travel-related\ninterchange and foreign\ntransaction fees.\n\nExpenses decreased 1%, as\nlower discretionary expenses\nand volume-related costs, as\nwell as efficiency savings,\nwere partially offset by\nongoing investment spending.\n\nProvisions of $1.3 billion\nincreased 90%, driven by a\nhigher allowance for credit\nlosses (ACL) build as well as\nhigher net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses increased 16%,\nas pandemic lockdowns and the\ndeterioration in the macro-\nenvironment impacted credit\nperformance.\n\nThe ACL build of $520 million\n(compared to a build of $7\nmillion in the prior year\nunder prior accounting\nstandards) was driven by\nbuilds during the first three\nquarters of 2020. The builds\nreflected the impact of a\ndeterioration in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook under\nthe CECL standard, including\nan increase in the qualitative\nmanagement adjustment to\nreflect the potential for a\nhigher level of stress and a\nslower economic recovery,\npartially offset by lower loan\nvolumes, both primarily driven\nby the pandemic.

ICG provides\ncorporate, institutional,\npublic sector and high-net-\nworth clients around the world\nwith a full range of wholesale\nbanking products and services,\nincluding fixed income and\nequity sales and trading,\nforeign exchange, prime\nbrokerage, derivative\nservices, equity and fixed\nincome research, corporate\nlending, investment banking\nand advisory services, private\nbanking, cash management,\ntrade finance and securities\nservices. ICG transacts with\nclients in both cash\ninstruments and derivatives,\nincluding fixed income,\nforeign currency, equity and\ncommodity products.\n\nICG revenue is generated\nprimarily from fees and\nspreads associated with these\nactivities. ICG earns fee\nincome for assisting clients\nwith transactional services\nand clearing and providing\nbrokerage and investment\nbanking services and other\nsuch activities. Such fees are\nrecognized at the point in\ntime when Citigroup\u2019s\nperformance under the terms of\na contractual arrangement is\ncompleted, which is typically\nat the trade/execution date or\nclosing of a transaction.\nRevenue generated from these\nactivities is recorded in\nCommissions and fees and\nInvestment banking . Revenue\nis also generated from assets\nunder custody and\nadministration, which is\nrecognized as/when the\nassociated promised service is\nsatisfied, which normally\noccurs at the point in time\nthe service is requested by\nthe customer and provided by\nCiti. Revenue generated from\nthese activities is primarily\nrecorded in Administration and\nother fiduciary fees . For\nadditional information on\nthese various types of\nrevenues, see Note 5 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nIn addition, as a market\nmaker, ICG facilitates\ntransactions, including\nholding product inventory to\nmeet client demand, and earns\nthe differential between the\nprice at which it buys and\nsells the products. These\nprice differentials and the\nunrealized gains and losses on\nthe inventory are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . Mark-\nto-market gains and losses on\ncertain credit derivatives\n(used to hedge the corporate\nloan portfolio) are also\nrecorded in Principal\ntransactions , (for additional\ninformation on Principal\ntransactions revenue, see Note\n6 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements). Other\nprimarily includes realized\ngains and losses on available-\nfor-sale (AFS) debt\nsecurities, gains and losses\non equity securities not held\nin trading accounts and other\nnon-recurring gains and\nlosses. Interest income earned\non assets held, less interest\npaid on long- and short-term\ndebt and to customers on\ndeposits, is recorded as Net\ninterest revenue .\n\nThe amount and types of\nMarkets revenues are impacted\nby a variety of interrelated\nfactors, including market\nliquidity; changes in market\nvariables such as interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates,\nequity prices, commodity\nprices and credit spreads, as\nwell as their implied\nvolatilities; investor\nconfidence and other\nmacroeconomic conditions.\nAssuming all other market\nconditions do not change,\nincreases in client activity\nlevels or bid/offer spreads\ngenerally result in increases\nin revenues. However, changes\nin market conditions can\nsignificantly impact client\nactivity levels, bid/offer\nspreads and the fair value of\nproduct inventory. For\nexample, a decrease in\n\nmarket liquidity may increase\nbid/offer spreads, decrease\nclient activity levels and\nwiden credit spreads on\nproduct inventory positions.\n\nICG \u2019s management of the\nMarkets businesses involves\ndaily monitoring and\nevaluation of the above\nfactors at the trading desk as\nwell as the country level. ICG\ndoes not separately track the\nimpact on total Markets\nrevenues of the volume of\ntransactions, bid/offer\nspreads, fair value changes of\nproduct inventory positions\nand economic hedges because,\nas noted above, these\ncomponents are interrelated\nand are not deemed useful or\nnecessary to manage the\nMarkets businesses at an\naggregate level.\n\nIn the Markets businesses,\nclient revenues are those\nrevenues directly attributable\nto client transactions at the\ntime of inception, including\ncommissions, interest or fees\nearned. Client revenues do not\ninclude the results of client\nfacilitation activities (e.g.,\nholding product inventory in\nanticipation of client demand)\nor the results of certain\neconomic hedging activities.\n\nICG \u2019s international presence\nis supported by trading floors\nin approximately 80 countries\nand a proprietary network in\n96 countries and\njurisdictions.

Excluding the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges, Banking revenues\ndeclined 3%, as growth in\ninvestment banking and the\nprivate bank was more than\noffset by a decrease in\ntreasury and trade solutions\nand corporate lending.\nExcluding the pretax gain of\napproximately $350 million on\nCiti\u2019s investment in Tradeweb\nin the prior year, Markets and\nsecurities services revenues\nincreased 32%, primarily\ndriven by growth in both fixed\nincome markets and equity\nmarkets, partially offset by a\ndecline in securities\nservices.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nwere up 11%, reflecting growth\nin overall market wallet as\nwell as gains in wallet share.\nAdvisory revenues decreased\n20%, primarily reflecting a\ndecline in the market wallet\nlargely due to the pandemic\nand a decline in wallet share.\nEquity underwriting revenues\nincreased 64%, reflecting\ngrowth in North America , EMEA\nand Asia , driven by continued\nstrength in the market wallet,\nreflecting improved market\nliquidity and investor\nsentiment as well as wallet\nshare gains. Debt underwriting\nrevenues increased 7%,\nreflecting particular strength\nin North America , partially\noffset by Latin America ,\nprimarily driven by an\nincrease in the second quarter\nof 2020, as the business\nassisted clients with sourcing\nliquidity. The increase in\nrevenues was largely driven by\na higher market wallet in\ninvestment grade debt\nunderwriting, as well as an\nincrease in overall wallet\nshare.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 7%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, revenues\ndecreased 5%, primarily driven\nby declines in EMEA and Asia .\nThe decline in revenues was\ndriven by both the cash and\ntrade businesses. In the cash\nbusiness, the decline in\nrevenues reflected lower\ninterest rates and a slowdown\nin commercial cards spend\ndriven by the pandemic,\npartially offset by strong\ndeposit volumes. Average\ndeposit balances increased 23%\n(22% excluding the impact of\nFX translation), reflecting\nstrong client engagement and\nsolid growth across all\nregions. In trade, revenues\nwere impacted by a decline in\ntrade fees and trade loans,\nreflecting a slowdown in\nunderlying trade flows related\nto the pandemic, partially\noffset by improved trade\nspreads.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\ndecreased 15%, including lower\nlosses on loan hedges.\nExcluding the impact of losses\non loan hedges, revenues\ndecreased 25%, driven by lower\nloan spreads, an adjustment to\nthe residual value of a lease\nfinancing asset and higher\nhedging costs, partially\noffset by higher average loan\nvolumes. Average loans were up\n4%, reflecting higher volumes\nas the business\n\nassisted clients with sourcing\nliquidity in the evolving\nenvironment, primarily in the\nfirst half of 2020. End-of-\nperiod loans declined 9% in\nthe current year, primarily\nreflecting repayments, as\nCiti\u2019s clients accessed the\ncapital markets, as well as\nlower loan demand in the\nsecond half of 2020, given\nmore muted economic activity.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 9%. Excluding the\nimpact of gains on loan\nhedges, revenues increased 8%,\nreflecting strength across all\nregions, driven by continued\nsolid client engagement, in\nparticular in capital markets,\nhigher managed investments\nrevenues and higher loan and\ndeposit volumes, partially\noffset by lower deposit\nspreads due to the low\ninterest rate environment.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 34%.\nExcluding the Tradeweb gain in\nthe prior year, revenues\nincreased 38%, reflecting\nstrength across all regions,\ndriven by strong client\nactivity in rates and\ncurrencies, spread products\nand commodities, due to the\nimpact of market conditions,\nincluding elevated volatility\nrelated to the pandemic\nprimarily in the first half of\nthe year, and developments\nrelated to vaccines and the\nU.S. elections in the second\nhalf of the year. Non-interest\nrevenues increased, reflecting\nhigher corporate and investor\nactivity, given elevated\nvolumes, spreads and\nvolatility, primarily in the\nfirst half the year. Net\ninterest revenues also\nincreased, largely reflecting\na change in the mix of trading\npositions in support of client\nactivity, as well as lower\nfunding costs.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\nincreased 32%, primarily\ndriven by higher G10 rates and\ncurrencies revenues in North\nAmerica and EMEA , as Citi\nhelped corporate and investor\nclients reposition their\nportfolios in a volatile\nmarket environment driven by\nthe pandemic largely in the\nfirst half of 2020. Spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome revenues increased 40%,\nreflecting strong client\nactivity following robust\nprimary issuance, particularly\nin flow trading, as well as a\nmore favorable market making\nenvironment, as evidenced by\nspread tightening. Commodities\nrevenues increased, reflecting\na more favorable market making\nenvironment, as volatility\nremained elevated,\nparticularly in gold and oil.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 25%, driven by\nhigher revenues in cash\nequities and derivatives,\npartially offset by a modest\ndecline in prime finance\nrevenues. Cash equities\nrevenues increased driven by\nelevated levels of client\nactivity. Equity derivatives\nrevenues increased, reflecting\nstrong client activity and\ncontinued market volatility,\nparticularly in North America\n. The decline in prime finance\nrevenues was largely due to\nlower financing spreads. Non-\ninterest revenues increased,\nprimarily driven by higher\nprincipal transactions and\ncommissions and fee revenues,\ndue to higher client activity\nand a more favorable trading\nenvironment due to volatility\nrelated to the pandemic and\ndevelopments\n                               29                               \nrelated to vaccines and U.S.\nelections, as well as a change\nin the mix of trading\npositions in support of client\nactivity.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\ndecreased 3%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues decreased 1%, as\nhigher deposit volumes were\nmore than offset by lower\ndeposit spreads due to the low\ninterest rate environment.\n\nFor additional information on\ntrends in ICG \u2019s deposits and\ntrade loans, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Liquidity\nRisk\u2014Loans\u201d and \u201c\u2014Deposits\u201d\nbelow.\n\nExpenses increased 6%,\nreflecting investments in\ninfrastructure, risk\nmanagement and controls,\nhigher compensation costs,\noperational losses related to\ncertain legal matters and\nvolume-driven growth,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nProvisions increased to $5.6\nbillion, driven by net credit\nlosses of $987 million\n(compared to $394 million in\nthe prior year), and an ACL\nbuild of $4.6 billion\n(compared to a modest build in\nthe prior year under prior\naccounting standards). The\nincrease in net credit losses\nwas largely driven by write-\noffs across various sectors in\nboth North America and EMEA ,\nprimarily reflecting energy\nand energy-related exposures.\nThe net credit losses were\npartially offset by the\nrelease of previously\nestablished ACL reserves.\n\nThe increase in the ACL build\nwas driven by builds during\nthe first half of 2020. The\nbuilds reflected the impact of\na deterioration in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook under\nthe CECL standard, driven by\nthe impact of the pandemic\nacross multiple sectors, as\nwell as downgrades in the\ncorporate portfolios. Sectors\nsignificantly impacted by the\npandemic (including\ntransportation; commercial\nreal estate; energy and\nenergy-related; and consumer\nretail) drove approximately\nhalf of the ACL reserve build\nduring 2020. The reserve build\nalso included an increase in\nthe qualitative management\nadjustment to reflect the\npotential for a higher level\nof stress and a slower\neconomic recovery.

Further, Citi\u2019s\ncapital levels may also be\naffected by changes in\naccounting and regulatory\nstandards, as well as U.S.\ncorporate tax laws and the\nimpact of future events on\nCiti\u2019s business results, such\nas changes in interest and\nforeign exchange rates, as\nwell as business and asset\ndispositions.\n\nDuring 2020, Citi returned a\ntotal of $7.2 billion of\ncapital to common shareholders\nin the form of share\nrepurchases (approximately 41\nmillion common shares) and\ndividends. On March 15, 2020,\nCiti announced it had joined\nother major U.S. banks in\nsuspending share repurchases\nto support clients in light of\nthe pandemic.

Citi\nassesses its capital adequacy\nagainst a series of internal\nquantitative capital goals,\ndesigned to evaluate its\ncapital levels in expected and\nstressed economic\nenvironments. Underlying these\ninternal quantitative capital\ngoals are strategic capital\nconsiderations, centered on\npreserving and building\nfinancial strength.\n\nThe Citigroup Capital\nCommittee, with oversight from\nthe Risk Management Committee\nof Citigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors, has responsibility\nfor Citi\u2019s aggregate capital\nstructure, including the\ncapital assessment and\nplanning process, which is\nintegrated into Citi\u2019s capital\nplan.

These rules\nestablish an integrated\ncapital adequacy framework,\nencompassing both risk-based\ncapital ratios and leverage\nratios.\n                                                                \n  Risk-Based Capital Ratios                                     \n                                                                \nThe U.S. Basel III rules set\nforth the composition of\nregulatory capital (including\nthe application of regulatory\ncapital adjustments and\ndeductions), as well as two\ncomprehensive methodologies (a\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches) for\nmeasuring total risk-weighted\nassets. Total risk-weighted\nassets under the Advanced\nApproaches, which are\nprimarily models based,\ninclude credit, market and\noperational risk-weighted\nassets. The Standardized\nApproach generally applies\nprescribed supervisory risk\nweights to broad categories of\ncredit risk exposures. As a\nresult, credit risk-weighted\nassets calculated under the\nAdvanced Approaches are more\nrisk sensitive than those\ncalculated under the\nStandardized Approach. Market\nrisk-weighted assets are\ncurrently calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis\nunder both approaches. The\nStandardized Approach excludes\noperational risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, both Citi and Citibank,\nN.A. (Citibank) are required\nto maintain stated minimum\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital and Total\nCapital ratios of 4.5%, 6.0%\nand 8.0%, respectively.\nFurther, the U.S. Basel III\nrules implement the \u201ccapital\nfloor provision\u201d of the so-\ncalled \u201cCollins Amendment\u201d of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, which\nrequires Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations to\ncalculate each of the three\nrisk-based capital ratios\n(Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital and Total\nCapital) under both the U.S.\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach and the Advanced\nApproaches and comply with the\nlower of each of the resulting\nrisk-based capital ratios.\n                                                                \n  Tier 1 Leverage Ratio                                         \n                                                                \nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, Citi is also required\nto maintain a minimum Tier 1\nLeverage ratio of 4.0%. The\nTier 1 Leverage ratio, a non-\nrisk-based measure of capital\nadequacy, is defined as Tier 1\nCapital as a percentage of\nquarterly adjusted average\ntotal assets less amounts\ndeducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n                               32                               \n                                                                \n  Supplementary Leverage Ratio                                  \n                                                                \nCiti is also required to\ncalculate a Supplementary\nLeverage ratio, which differs\nfrom the Tier 1 Leverage ratio\nby also including certain off-\nbalance sheet exposures within\nthe denominator of the ratio\n(Total Leverage Exposure). The\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nrepresents end of period Tier\n1 Capital to Total Leverage\nExposure, with the latter\ndefined as the sum of the\ndaily average of on-balance\nsheet assets for the quarter\nand the average of certain\noff-balance sheet exposures\ncalculated as of the last day\nof each month in the quarter,\nless applicable Tier 1 Capital\ndeductions. Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations are required to\nmaintain a stated minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nof 3.0%.\n\nFurther, U.S. GSIBs, including\nCiti, are subject to enhanced\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nstandards. The enhanced\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nstandards establish a 2.0%\nleverage buffer in addition to\nthe stated 3.0% minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nrequirement, for a total\neffective minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nrequirement of 5.0%. If a U.S.\nGSIB fails to exceed the 5.0%\neffective minimum\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nrequirement, it will be\nsubject to increasingly\nonerous restrictions\n(depending upon the extent of\nthe shortfall) regarding\ncapital distributions and\ndiscretionary executive bonus\npayments.\n                                                                \n  Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief                 \n                                                                \nIn April 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board issued an\ninterim final rule that\ntemporarily changes the\ncalculation of the\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nfor bank holding companies,\nincluding Citigroup, by\nexcluding U.S. Treasuries and\ndeposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks from Total Leverage\nExposure. Repo-style\ntransactions on U.S.\nTreasuries are not in scope\nfor this relief. The\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nis a non-risk-sensitive\nmeasure, and the temporary\nexclusion allows banking\norganizations to expand their\nbalance sheet, as appropriate,\nto continue to serve as\nfinancial intermediaries and\nto provide credit to\nhouseholds and businesses\nduring the pandemic.\n\nThe interim final rule became\neffective for Citigroup\u2019s\nSupplementary Leverage ratio,\nas well as for Citigroup\u2019s\nleverage-based Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) and\nLong-Term Debt (LTD)\nrequirements, beginning with\nthe quarter ended June 30,\n2020, and will continue\nthrough March 31, 2021.\nCitigroup\u2019s reported\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nof 7.0% benefited 109 basis\npoints during the fourth\nquarter of 2020 as a result of\nthe temporary relief.\nExcluding the temporary\nrelief, Citigroup\u2019s\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nwould have been 5.9%, compared\nwith a 5.0% effective minimum\nrequirement.\n\nIn June 2020, the U.S. banking\nagencies issued an interim\nfinal rule permitting\ndepository institutions,\nincluding Citibank, to elect\nto temporarily exclude U.S.\nTreasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks from\nTotal Leverage Exposure,\nsubject to the condition that\nthe depository institution\nreceive approval from its\nprimary federal banking\nregulator prior to paying\ndividends or making certain\nother capital distributions\nwhile the exclusion is in\neffect. Citibank did not elect\nto temporarily exclude U.S.\nTreasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks from\nTotal Leverage\n\nExposure. Accordingly, the\ncalculation methodology of\nCitibank\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio was unchanged.\n\nRegulatory Capital\nTreatment\u2014Modified Transition\nof the Current Expected Credit\nLosses Methodology\n\nIn September 2020, the U.S.\nbanking agencies issued a\nfinal rule (substantially\nunchanged from a March 2020\ninterim final rule) that\nmodifies the regulatory\ncapital transition provision\nrelated to the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology.\n\nThe final rule permits banks\nto delay for two years the\n\u201cDay One\u201d adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology on January 1, 2020\nuntil January 1, 2022,\nfollowed by a three-year\ntransition to phase out the\nregulatory capital benefit\nprovided by the delay.\n\nIn addition, for the ongoing\nimpact of CECL, the agencies\nutilize a 25% scaling factor\nas an approximation of the\nincreased reserve build under\nCECL compared to the previous\nincurred loss model and,\ntherefore, allows banks to add\nback to Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital an amount equal to 25%\nof the change in CECL-based\nallowances recognized through\nearnings in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022, the\ncumulative 25% change in CECL-\nbased allowances recognized\nthrough earnings between\nJanuary 1, 2020 and December\n31, 2021 will be phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per\nyear on January 1 of each year\nover the three-year transition\nperiod, along with the delayed\n\u201cDay One\u201d impact.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank have\nelected the modified CECL\ntransition provision provided\nby the rule beginning with the\nquarter ended March 31, 2020.\nAccordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from adoption of the\nCECL methodology, as well as\nthe ongoing adjustments for\n25% of the change in CECL-\nbased allowances recognized\nthrough earnings in each\nquarter between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021,\nwill now commence phase-in on\nJanuary 1, 2022 and will be\nfully reflected in Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital as of\nJanuary 1, 2025.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe U.S. banking agencies\u2019\noriginal regulatory capital\ntransition provision related\nto the \u201cDay One\u201d adverse\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from adoption of the\nCECL methodology, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nTreatment\u2014Implementation and\nTransition of the Current\nExpected Credit Losses (CECL)\nMethodology\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNeither the September 2020\nfinal rule nor the agencies\u2019\nprior guidance has any impact\non U.S. GAAP accounting.\n                               33                               \n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Buffers                                    \n                                                                \nCiti and Citibank are required\nto maintain several regulatory\ncapital buffers above stated\nminimum capital requirements.\nThese capital buffers would be\navailable to absorb losses in\nadvance of any potential\nimpairment of regulatory\ncapital below the stated\nminimum risk-based capital\nratio requirements. Any breach\nof the buffers to absorb\nlosses during periods of\nfinancial or economic stress\nwould result in restrictions\non earnings distributions\n(e.g., dividends, share\nrepurchases and discretionary\nexecutive bonuses), with the\ndegree of such restrictions\nbased upon the extent to which\nthe buffers are breached. For\nadditional information\nregarding limitations on\ncapital distributions, see\n\u201cUse of Regulatory Capital\nBuffers\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Stress Capital Buffer                                         \n                                                                \nIn March 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board issued the final\nStress Capital Buffer (SCB)\nrule, integrating the annual\nstress testing requirements\nwith ongoing regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n\nFor Citigroup only, the SCB\nreplaces the fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, and equals the peak-\nto-trough Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio decline under\nthe Supervisory Severely\nAdverse scenario used in the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST), plus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, subject to a floor\nof 2.5%. The fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nwill continue to apply under\nthe Advanced Approaches. SCB-\nbased minimum capital\nrequirements will generally be\nupdated once per year as part\nof the CCAR process. For\nadditional information\nregarding CCAR and DFAST, see\n\u201cStress Testing Component of\nCapital Planning\u201d below.\n\nIn August 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board finalized and\nannounced Citi\u2019s SCB\nrequirement of 2.5%.\nAccordingly, effective October\n1, 2020, Citigroup is required\nto maintain a 10.0% effective\nminimum Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio under the\nStandardized Approach, which\nis unchanged from Citi\u2019s\nprevious effective minimum\nrequirement Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital ratio under the\nStandardized Approach\ninclusive of the 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board may,\nbut is not required to,\nrecalculate Citi\u2019s SCB as a\nresult of the capital plan\nresubmission, and has deferred\nsuch a decision through March\n31, 2021. For additional\ninformation on the capital\nplan resubmission, which the\nFederal Reserve Board required\nfor each firm subject to its\ncapital plan rule, see\n\u201cCapital Plan Resubmission and\nRelated Limitations on Capital\nDistributions\u201d below.\n\nThe SCB applies to Citigroup\nonly. The regulatory capital\nframework applicable to\nCitibank, including the\nCapital Conservation Buffer,\nis unchanged by the SCB final\nrule.\n\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer\n\nCitigroup is subject to a\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer under the\nAdvanced Approaches and, prior\nto the October 1, 2020\neffective date of the SCB,\nunder the Standardized\nApproach as well. Citibank is\nsubject to the fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nunder both the Advanced\nApproaches and the\nStandardized Approach.\n\nAdditionally, Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations, such as Citi\nand Citibank, are subject to a\ndiscretionary Countercyclical\nCapital Buffer. The Federal\nReserve Board last voted to\naffirm the Countercyclical\nCapital Buffer amount at the\ncurrent level of 0% in\nDecember 2020.\n                                                                \n  GSIB Surcharge                                                \n                                                                \nThe Federal Reserve Board\nimposes a risk-based capital\nsurcharge upon U.S. bank\nholding companies that are\nidentified as global\nsystemically important bank\nholding companies (GSIBs),\nincluding Citi. The GSIB\nsurcharge augments the SCB,\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand, if invoked, any\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer.\n\nA U.S. bank holding company\nthat is designated a GSIB is\nrequired, on an annual basis,\nto calculate a surcharge using\ntwo methods and is subject to\nthe higher of the resulting\ntwo surcharges. The first\nmethod (\u201cmethod 1\u201d) is based\non the Basel Committee\u2019s GSIB\nmethodology. Under the second\nmethod (\u201cmethod 2\u201d), the\nsubstitutability category\nunder the Basel Committee\u2019s\nGSIB methodology is replaced\nwith a quantitative measure\nintended to assess a GSIB\u2019s\nreliance on short-term\nwholesale funding. In\naddition, method 1\nincorporates relative measures\nof systemic importance across\ncertain global banking\norganizations and a year-end\nspot foreign exchange rate,\nwhereas method 2 uses fixed\nmeasures of systemic\nimportance and application of\nan average foreign exchange\nrate over a three-year period.\nThe GSIB surcharges calculated\nunder both method 1 and method\n2 are based on measures of\nsystemic importance from the\nyear immediately preceding\nthat in which the GSIB\nsurcharge calculations are\nbeing performed (e.g., the\nmethod 1 and method 2 GSIB\nsurcharges to be calculated by\nDecember 31, 2021 will be\nbased on 2020 systemic\nindicator data). Generally,\nCiti\u2019s surcharge determined\nunder method 2 will result in\na higher surcharge than its\nsurcharge determined under\nmethod 1.\n\nShould a GSIB\u2019s systemic\nimportance change year-over-\nyear such that it becomes\nsubject to a higher surcharge,\nthe higher surcharge would not\nbecome effective for a full\nyear (e.g., a higher surcharge\ncalculated by December 31,\n2021 would not become\neffective until January 1,\n2023). However, if a GSIB\u2019s\nsystemic importance changes\nsuch that the GSIB would be\nsubject to a lower surcharge,\nthe GSIB would be subject to\nthe lower surcharge beginning\nwith the next calendar year\n(e.g., a lower surcharge\ncalculated by December 31,\n2021 would become effective\nJanuary 1, 2022).\n                               34                               \nThe following table sets forth\nCiti\u2019s effective GSIB\nsurcharge as determined under\nmethod 1 and method 2 for 2020\nand 2019:\n                                  \n              2020       2019     \n  Method 1     2.0  %     2.0  %  \n  Method 2     3.0        3.0     \n                                  \nCiti\u2019s GSIB surcharge effective for both 2020 and 2019 was 3.0%,\nas derived under the higher method 2 result. Citi\u2019s GSIB\nsurcharge effective for 2021 will remain unchanged at 3.0%, as\nderived under the higher method 2 result. Citi expects that its\nmethod 2 GSIB surcharge will continue to remain higher than its\nmethod 1 GSIB surcharge. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective for 2022 will not exceed 3.0%. Citi\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective for 2023 will likely be based on the lower of its\nmethod 2 scores for year-end 2020 and 2021, and could increase\nto 3.5%. Use of Regulatory Capital Buffers In March 2020, the\nU.S. banking agencies issued a statement encouraging banking\norganizations to use their regulatory capital buffers as they\nrespond to the challenges presented by the effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with the statement, in October\n2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final rule\n(substantially unchanged from two previous interim final rules\nin March 2020) that eases capital distribution limitations in\nthe original U.S. Basel III rules, in an effort to reduce the\nimpact of using regulatory capital buffers. The changes in the\nrule have the potential to prevent a complete and sudden\ncessation of capital distributions due to a breach of regulatory\ncapital buffers, which include the SCB, Capital Conservation\nBuffer, GSIB surcharge, and any Countercyclical Capital Buffer\n(currently 0%). The rule became effective in March 2020, and\napplies to risk-based capital ratios, the Supplementary Leverage\nratio, and RWA-based or leverage-based external TLAC buffers.\nExternal Long-Term Debt requirements do not include any buffers\nand are, therefore, unaffected by the final rule. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s TLAC-related requirements, see \u201cTotal\nLoss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Compliance,\nConduct and Legal Risks\u201d below. More specifically, under the\nU.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations that fall below\ntheir regulatory capital buffers are subject to limitations on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to\nexecutive officers based on a percentage of \u201cEligible Retained\nIncome\u201d (ERI), with increasing restrictions based upon the\nseverity of the breach. The original definition of ERI in the\nU.S. Basel III rules was equal to the bank\u2019s net income for the\nfour calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter,\nnet of any distributions and tax effects not already reflected\nin net income. The final rule revises the definition of ERI to\nequal the greater of: (i) the bank\u2019s net income for the four\ncalendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, net of\nany distributions and tax effects not already reflected in net\nincome, and (ii) the average of the bank\u2019s net income for the\nfour calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Citi\u2019s regulatory capital ratios\nexceeded effective regulatory minimum requirements. Citi is not\nsubject to payout limitations as a result of Basel III\nrequirements. For information related to capital distribution\nlimitations that are currently in effect for large banks, see\n\u201cCapital Plan Resubmission and Related Limitations on Capital\nDistributions\u201d below. The impact of the final rule on Citibank\nis limited, because the minimum requirements to be considered\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nframework are unchanged. Prompt Corrective Action Framework In\ngeneral, the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations direct\nthe U.S. banking agencies to enforce increasingly strict\nlimitations on the activities of insured depository institutions\nthat fail to meet certain regulatory capital thresholds. The PCA\nframework contains five categories of capital adequacy as\nmeasured by risk-based capital and leverage ratios: (i) \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d (ii) \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d (iii)\n\u201cundercapitalized,\u201d (iv) \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d and\n(v) \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d Accordingly, an insured\ndepository institution, such as Citibank, must maintain minimum\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and\nTier 1 Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%,\nrespectively, to be considered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d In addition,\ninsured depository institution subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs,\nincluding Citibank, must maintain a minimum Supplementary\nLeverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\nCitibank was \u201cwell capitalized\u201d as of December 31, 2020. Stress\nTesting Component of Capital Planning Citi is subject to an\nannual assessment by the Federal Reserve Board as to whether\nCitigroup has effective capital planning processes as well as\nsufficient regulatory capital to absorb losses during stressful\neconomic and financial conditions, while also meeting\nobligations to creditors and counterparties and continuing to\nserve as a credit intermediary. This annual assessment includes\ntwo related programs: the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and\nReview (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST). For the\nlargest and most complex firms, such as Citi, CCAR includes a\nqualitative evaluation of a firm\u2019s abilities to determine its\ncapital needs on a forward-looking basis. In conducting the\nqualitative assessment, the Federal Reserve Board evaluates\nfirms\u2019 capital planning practices, focusing on six areas of\ncapital planning\u2014namely, governance, risk management, internal\ncontrols, capital policies, incorporating stressful conditions\nand events, and estimating impact on capital positions. As part\nof the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve Board evaluates Citi\u2019s\ncapital adequacy, capital adequacy process and its planned\ncapital distributions, such as dividend payments and common\nshare repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board assesses whether\nCiti has sufficient capital to continue operations throughout\ntimes of economic and financial market stress and whether Citi\nhas robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that\naccount for its unique risks.\n                               35                               \nSince firms are now required\nto maintain risk-based capital\nratio minimum requirements\nthat integrate stress test\nresults, the Federal Reserve\nBoard\u2019s SCB final rule\neliminated a number of\nprevious CCAR requirements,\nincluding the once-a-year\nquantitative objection, the\npre-approval requirement from\nthe Federal Reserve Board for\nmaking distributions in excess\nof planned capital actions,\nand the 30% dividend payout\nratio as a criterion for\nheightened supervisory\nscrutiny.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including\nCiti, are subject to a\nrigorous evaluation of their\ncapital planning process.\nFirms with weak practices may\nbe subject to a deficient\nsupervisory rating, and\npotentially an enforcement\naction, for failing to meet\nsupervisory expectations. For\nadditional information\nregarding CCAR, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nbelow.\n\nDFAST is a forward-looking\nquantitative evaluation of the\nimpact of stressful economic\nand financial market\nconditions on Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. This\nprogram serves to inform the\nFederal Reserve Board and the\ngeneral public as to how\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios might change using a\nhypothetical set of adverse\neconomic conditions as\ndesigned by the Federal\nReserve Board. In addition to\nthe annual supervisory stress\ntest conducted by the Federal\nReserve Board, Citi is\nrequired to conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests under\nthe same adverse economic\nconditions designed by the\nFederal Reserve Board.\n\nBoth CCAR and DFAST include an\nestimate of projected\nrevenues, losses, reserves,\npro forma regulatory capital\nratios, and any other\nadditional capital measures\ndeemed relevant by Citi.\nProjections are required over\na nine-quarter planning\nhorizon under two supervisory\nscenarios (baseline and\nseverely adverse conditions).\nAll risk-based capital ratios\nreflect application of the\nStandardized Approach\nframework under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules. Moreover, the\nFederal Reserve Board has\ndeferred the use of the\nAdvanced Approaches framework\nindefinitely.\n\nIn addition, Citibank is\nrequired to conduct the annual\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Test.\nThe annual stress test\nconsists of a forward-looking\nquantitative evaluation of the\nimpact of stressful economic\nand financial market\nconditions under several\nscenarios on Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital. This\nprogram serves to inform the\nOffice of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency as to how\nCitibank\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios might change during a\nhypothetical set of adverse\neconomic conditions and to\nultimately evaluate the\nreliability of Citibank\u2019s\ncapital planning process.\n\nCapital Plan Resubmission and\nRelated Limitations on Capital\nDistributions\n\nIn June 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board determined that\nchanges in financial markets\nand macroeconomic outlooks\nrelated to the COVID-19\npandemic could have a material\neffect on the risk profile and\nfinancial condition of each\nfirm subject to its capital\nplan rule and, therefore,\nrequired updated capital\nplans. Citigroup resubmitted\nits capital plan in November\n2020.\n\nIn December 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board announced\n\nthat it was modifying and\nextending for an additional\nquarter several measures that\nwere previously announced for\nthe third and fourth quarters\nof 2020 to ensure that large\nbanks maintain a high level of\ncapital resilience. Through\nthe end of the first quarter\nof 2021, the Federal Reserve\nBoard has authorized firms,\nincluding Citi, to pay common\nstock dividends and make share\nrepurchases that, in the\naggregate, do not exceed an\namount equal to the average of\nthe firm\u2019s net income for the\nfour preceding calendar\nquarters, unless otherwise\nspecified by the Federal\nReserve Board, provided that\nthe firm does not exceed the\namount of common stock\ndividends paid in the second\nquarter of 2020. Additionally,\nthrough the end of the first\nquarter of 2021, the Federal\nReserve Board has authorized\nfirms to make share\nrepurchases relating to\nissuances of common stock\nrelated to employee stock\nownership plans, and to redeem\nand make scheduled payments on\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital and\nTier 2 Capital instruments.\nThese limitations on capital\ndistributions may be extended\nor modified by the Federal\nReserve Board.\n\nOn June 29, 2020, Citi\nannounced its planned capital\nactions including common\ndividends.

For prior periods presented, Citi\u2019s effective\nminimum risk-based capital requirements include the 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer and the 3.0% GSIB surcharge under both\nApproaches.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision\nrelated to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on\nregulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax),\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences,\nand the ACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have\nbeen deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per\nyear commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL,\nCitigroup is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in\nan amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL recognized\nthrough earnings (pretax) for each period between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to\nretained earnings and the ACL between January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at\n25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred\nimpacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.\nCorresponding adjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are\nreflected in quarterly adjusted average total assets and Total\nLeverage Exposure. Additionally, the increase in DTAs arising\nfrom temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption\ndate has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will\nphase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\n\n(3) Citi\u2019s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1\nCapital ratios were derived under the Basel III Advanced\nApproaches framework as of December 31, 2020 and September 30,\n2020, and the Basel III Standardized Approach as of December 31,\n2019, whereas Citi\u2019s reportable Total Capital ratio was the\nlower derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework\nfor all periods presented.\n\n(4) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly\naverage total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n\n(5) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Commencing with\nthe second quarter of 2020, Citigroup\u2019s Total Leverage Exposure\ntemporarily excludes U.S. Treasuries and deposits at Federal\nReserve Banks.

Citi\u2019s\nreportable Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital ratio was 11.8% at\nDecember 31, 2019 under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach. Citi\u2019s Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital ratio remained\nunchanged from September 30,\n2020, as a net increase in\nrisk-weighted assets and the\nreturn of $1.1 billion capital\nto common\n\nshareholders in the form of\ndividends were offset by\nquarter-to-date net income of\n$4.3 billion. Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio\ndecreased from year-end 2019,\nlargely driven by a net\nincrease in risk-weighted\nassets and the return of $7.2\nbillion of capital to common\nshareholders in the form of\nshare repurchases and\ndividends, partially offset by\nyear-to-date net income of\n$11.0 billion, beneficial net\nmovements in AOCI , and the\nrelief of the

2019, respectively, are excluded from common\nstockholders\u2019 equity and netted against such preferred stock in\naccordance with Federal Reserve Board regulatory reporting\nrequirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision\nrelated to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on\nregulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the\nACL upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been\ndeferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL,\nCitigroup is allowed to adjust retained earnings and the ACL in\nan amount equal to 25% of the change in the ACL recognized\nthrough earnings (pretax) for each period between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to\nretained earnings and the ACL between January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at\n25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred\nimpacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.\n\n(3) Includes goodwill \u201cembedded\u201d in the valuation of significant\ncommon stock investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions.\n\n(4) Of Citi's $24.8 billion of net DTAs at December 31, 2020,\n$15.3 billion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\npursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.5 billion was\nexcluded. Excluded from Citi's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as\nof December 31, 2020 was $11.6 billion of net DTAs arising from\nnet operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business\ncredit tax carry-forwards. The amount excluded was reduced by\n$2.1 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible assets that are separately deducted\nfrom capital . DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required\nto be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under\nthe U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences are required to be deducted from capital only if\nthese DTAs exceed a 10% limitation under the U.S. Basel III\nrules. Citi\u2019s DTAs do not currently exceed this limitation and,\ntherefore, are not subject to deduction from Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting at 250%.\n\n(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the\nVolcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting\ncertain proprietary investment activities and limits their\nownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. The U.S.\nagencies issued a revised Volcker Rule 2.0 in November 2019 that\nremoves permitted investments in third-party covered funds from\ncapital deduction requirements, among other changes. Upon the\nremoval of the capital deduction, permitted investments in\nthird-party covered funds will be included in risk-weighted\nassets. Mandatory compliance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0\nis required by January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted,\nin whole or in part, beginning January 1, 2020. Additionally,\nthe U.S. agencies issued a revised Volcker Rule 2.1 in July 2020\nthat improves and streamlines several \u201ccovered funds\u201d\nrequirements, with an effective date of October 1, 2020. Citi\ncontinues to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership\ninterests in covered funds for all periods presented.\n\n(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the\nU.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased out of Tier 2\nCapital by January 1, 2022.\n\n(8) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach, in which the ACL\nis eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of\ncredit risk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted\nin arriving at credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of\nACL that was eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject\nto limitation, under the Standardized Approach framework was\n$14.0 billion and $13.9 billion at December 31, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 respectively.\n                               39                               \n                                                                \n  Citigroup Capital

Non-\nsignificant investments in the\ncapital of unconsolidated\nfinancial institutions that\nare not deducted from\nregulatory capital are risk\nweighted in the usual manner.\n\nUnder the final rule, an\ninvestment in a \u201ccovered debt\ninstrument\u201d will be treated as\nan investment in a Tier 2\nCapital instrument and,\ntherefore, will be subject to\ndeduction from the Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganization\u2019s own Tier 2\nCapital in accordance with the\nexisting rules for non-\nsignificant investments in\nunconsolidated financial\ninstitutions. Covered debt\ninstruments include unsecured\ndebt instruments that are\n\u201celigible debt securities\u201d for\npurposes of the TLAC rule, or\nthat are pari passu or\nsubordinated to such\nsecurities, in addition to\ncertain unsecured debt\ninstruments issued by foreign\nGSIBs.\n\nTo support a deep and liquid\nmarket for covered debt\ninstruments, the rule provides\nan exception from the approach\ndescribed above for covered\ndebt instruments held for\nmarket-making activities for\n30 days or less (or longer,\nfor synthetic exposures only),\nif the aggregate amount of\nsuch debt instruments does not\nexceed 5% of the banking\norganization\u2019s Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital.\n\nAdditionally, the final rule\nrequires banking organizations\nto deduct from Tier 2 Capital\ninvestments in their own\ncovered debt instruments.\n\nThe final rule will become\neffective for Citigroup and\nCitibank on April 1, 2021.\nCiti estimates that the final\nrule will not significantly\nimpact Citigroup or Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital upon\nadoption.\n\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk\n\nIn January 2020, the U.S.\nbanking agencies issued a\nfinal\n\nrule to introduce the\nStandardized Approach for\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk (SA-\nCCR) in the U.S. The\n\nmandatory compliance date of\nthe SA-CCR final rule is\n\nJanuary 1, 2022, and early\nadoption was originally\n\npermitted beginning April 1,\n2020. For additional\n\ninformation on the SA-CCR\nfinal rule, see \u201cCapital\n\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nStandards Developments\u201d\n\nin Citi\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\nIn March 2020, the U.S.\nbanking agencies issued an\n\ninterim final rule permitting\nbanks to early adopt the SA-\nCCR final rule beginning with\nthe quarter ended March 31,\n\n2020.\n\nCiti has not early adopted the\nSA-CCR final rule. Citi\nintends to implement SA-CCR\nupon the mandatory compliance\ndate of January 1, 2022.\n                                                                \n  Basel Committee                                               \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Deferral of Basel III Revisions                               \n                                                                \nIn April 2020, in light of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the\n\nBasel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel\n\nCommittee) announced that the\nimplementation date of the\n\nBasel III post-crisis\nregulatory reforms finalized\nin\n\nDecember 2017 has been\ndeferred by one year to\nJanuary 1,\n\n2023. The reforms relate to\nthe methodologies in deriving\n\ncredit and operational risk-\nweighted assets, the\nimposition\n\nof a new aggregate output\nfloor for risk-weighted\nassets,\n\nand revisions to the leverage\nratio framework. The Basel\nCommittee also announced that\nthe implementation date of\n\nthe revised market risk\nframework finalized in January\n\n2019 has been deferred by one\nyear to January 1, 2023.\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies may\nrevise the U.S. Basel\n\nIII rules in the future, in\nresponse to the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s\n\nBasel III post-crisis\nregulatory reforms and revised\nmarket\n\nrisk framework.\n\nTargeted Revisions to the\nCredit Valuation Adjustment\n                                                                \n  Framework                                                     \n                                                                \nIn July 2020, the Basel\nCommittee issued a standard\nwith targeted revisions to the\ncredit valuation adjustment\n(CVA) risk framework, which\nwas previously finalized in\nDecember 2017 and will become\neffective on January 1, 2023.\nThe revisions align the\nrevised CVA risk framework, in\npart, with the revised market\nrisk capital framework that\nwas finalized in January 2019.\nThe Basel Committee also\nadjusted the overall\ncalibration of capital\nrequirements calculated under\ntheir CVA risk framework.\n\nThe U.S. agencies may consider\nrevisions to the CVA risk\n\nframework under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules in the future, based\n\nupon the revisions adopted by\nthe Basel Committee.\n                               47                               \nTangible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Returns on\nEquity Tangible common equity\n(TCE), as defined by Citi,\nrepresents common\nstockholders\u2019 equity less\ngoodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nMSRs).

Other\nrisks and uncertainties,\nincluding those not currently\nknown to Citi or its\nmanagement, could also\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. Thus, the following\nshould not be considered a\ncomplete discussion of all of\nthe risks and uncertainties\nCiti may face.\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nRapidly Evolving Challenges\nand Uncertainties Related to\nthe COVID-19 Pandemic Will\nLikely Continue to Have\nNegative Impacts on Citi\u2019s\nBusinesses and Results of\nOperations and Financial\nCondition.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has\nbecome global, affecting all\nof the countries and\njurisdictions where Citi\noperates. The pandemic and\nresponses to it have had, and\nwill likely continue to have,\nsevere impacts on global\nhealth and economic\nconditions. These impacts will\ncontinue to evolve by region,\ncountry or state, largely\ndepending on the duration and\nseverity of the public health\nconsequences, including the\nduration and further spread of\nthe coronavirus; the potential\nfor new variants of the virus;\ntimely development, production\nand distribution of effective\nvaccines; availability of\ntherapeutics; public response;\nand government actions. The\nimpacts to global economic\nconditions include, among\nothers:\n\n\u2022 the institution of social\ndistancing and restrictions on\nbusinesses and the movement of\nthe public in and among the\nU.S. and other countries;\n\n\u2022 closures, reduced activity\nand failures of many\nbusinesses, leading to loss of\nrevenues and net losses;\n\n\u2022 sharply reduced U.S. and\nglobal economic output,\nresulting in significant\nlosses of employment and lower\nconsumer spending, cards\npurchase sales and loan\nvolumes;\n\n\u2022 lower interest rates;\n\n\u2022 disruption of global supply\nchains; and\n\n\u2022 significant disruption and\nvolatility in financial\nmarkets.\n\nThe pandemic has had, and will\nlikely continue to have,\nnegative impacts on Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses and overall results\nof operations and financial\ncondition, which could be\nmaterial. The extent of the\nimpact on Citi\u2019s operations\nand financial performance,\nincluding its ability to\nexecute its business\nstrategies and initiatives,\nwill continue to depend\nsignificantly on future\ndevelopments in the U.S. and\nglobally, which are uncertain\nand cannot be predicted,\nincluding the course of the\nvirus, as well as any delay or\nweakness in the economic\nrecovery or further economic\ndownturn.\n\nOngoing legislative and\nregulatory changes in the U.S.\nand globally to address the\neconomic impact from the\npandemic, such as consumer and\ncorporate relief measures and\ncontinued lower interest\nrates, could further affect\nCiti\u2019s businesses, operations\nand financial performance.\nCiti could also face\nchallenges, including legal\nand reputational, and scrutiny\nin its implementation of and\nongoing efforts to\n\nprovide these relief measures.\nSuch implementations and\nefforts have resulted in, and\nmay continue to result in,\nlitigation, including class\nactions, and regulatory and\ngovernment actions and\nproceedings. Such actions may\nresult in judgments,\nsettlements, penalties and\nfines adverse to Citi. In\naddition, the different types\nof government actions could\nvary in scale and duration\nacross jurisdictions and\nregions with varying degrees\nof effectiveness.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\nborrowers will also vary by\nsector or industry, with some\nborrowers experiencing greater\nstress levels, which could\nlead to increased pressure on\ntheir results of operations\nand financial condition,\nincreased borrowings or credit\nratings downgrades, thus\nlikely leading to higher\ncredit costs for Citi. In\naddition, stress levels\nultimately experienced by\nCiti\u2019s borrowers may be\ndifferent from and more\nintense than assumptions made\nin earlier estimates or models\nused by Citi, resulting in a\nfurther increase in Citi\u2019s ACL\nor net credit losses,\nparticularly as consumer and\nsmall business relief programs\nexpire and the benefits of\nfiscal stimulus start to\ndiminish.\n\nThe pandemic may not be\ncontained for an extended\nperiod of time. A prolonged\nhealth crisis could further\nreduce economic activity in\nthe U.S. and other countries,\nresulting in additional\ndeclines in employment and\nbusiness and consumer\nconfidence. These factors\ncould further negatively\nimpact global economic\nactivity and markets; cause a\ncontinued decline in the\ndemand for Citi\u2019s products and\nservices and in its revenues;\nfurther increase Citi\u2019s credit\nand other costs; and may\nresult in impairment of long-\nlived assets or goodwill.\nThese factors could also cause\na continued increase in Citi\u2019s\nbalance sheet, risk-weighted\nassets and ACL, resulting in a\ndecline in regulatory capital\nratios or liquidity measures,\nas well as regulatory demands\nfor higher capital levels\nand/or limitations or\nreductions in capital\ndistributions (such as common\nshare repurchases and\ndividends). Moreover, any\ndisruption or failure of\nCiti\u2019s performance of, or its\nability to perform, key\nbusiness functions, as a\nresult of the continued spread\nof COVID-19 or otherwise,\ncould adversely affect Citi\u2019s\noperations.\n\nAny disruption to, breaches of\nor attacks on Citi\u2019s\ninformation technology\nsystems, including from cyber\nincidents, could have adverse\neffects on Citi\u2019s businesses\n(see the operational processes\nand systems and cybersecurity\nrisk factors below). These\nsystems are supporting a\nsubstantial portion of Citi\u2019s\ncolleagues who have been\naffected by local pandemic\nrestrictions and have been\nforced to work remotely. In\naddition, these systems\ninterface with and depend on\nthird-party systems, and Citi\ncould experience service\ndenials or disruptions if\ndemand for such systems were\nto exceed capacity or if a\nthird-party system fails or\nexperiences any interruptions.\nCiti has also taken measures\nto maintain the health and\nsafety of its colleagues;\nhowever, these measures could\nresult in increased expenses,\nand widespread illness could\nnegatively affect staffing\nwithin certain functions,\nbusinesses or geographies. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s ability to\nrecruit, hire and onboard\ncolleagues in key areas could\nbe negatively impacted by\nglobal pandemic restrictions\n(see the qualified colleagues\nrisk factor below).\n                               49                               \nFurther, it is unclear how the\nmacroeconomic business\nenvironment or societal norms\nmay be impacted after the\npandemic. The post-pandemic\nenvironment may undergo\nunexpected developments or\nchanges in financial markets,\nthe fiscal, monetary, tax and\nregulatory environments and\nconsumer customer and\ncorporate client behavior.\nThese developments and changes\ncould have an adverse impact\non Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. Ongoing business\nand regulatory uncertainties\nand changes may make Citi\u2019s\nlonger-term business, balance\nsheet and strategic and budget\nplanning more difficult or\ncostly. Citi and its\nmanagement and businesses may\nalso experience increased or\ndifferent competitive and\nother challenges in this\nenvironment. To the extent\nthat it is not able to adapt\nor compete effectively, Citi\ncould experience loss of\nbusiness and its results of\noperations and financial\ncondition could suffer (see\nthe competitive challenges\nrisk factor below).\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to the\npandemic, as well as Citi\u2019s\nmanagement of pandemic-related\nrisks, see \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOverview\u201d above.\n\nCiti\u2019s Ability to Return\nCapital to Common Shareholders\nConsistent with Its Capital\nPlanning Efforts and Targets\nSubstantially Depends on\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements, Including the\nResults of the CCAR Process\nand Regulatory Stress Tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to return\ncapital to its common\nshareholders consistent with\nits capital planning efforts\nand targets, whether through\nits common stock dividend or\nthrough a share repurchase\nprogram, substantially\ndepends, among other things,\non regulatory capital\nrequirements, including the\nStress Capital Buffer (SCB),\nwhich is based upon the\nresults of the CCAR process\nrequired by the Federal\nReserve Board (FRB) as well as\nthe supervisory stress tests\nrequired under the Dodd-Frank\nAct (as described in more\ndetail below). Citi\u2019s ability\nto return capital also depends\non its results of operations\nand financial condition,\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions and effectiveness\nin managing its level of risk-\nweighted assets under both the\nAdvanced Approaches and the\nStandardized Approach,\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio\n(SLR) and global systemically\nimportant bank holding company\n(GSIB) surcharge, which has\nbeen made more challenging due\nto the pandemic-related\nelevated levels of liquidity\nin the financial system (see\nmacroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties risk factor\nbelow).\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to accurately\npredict, interpret or explain\nto stakeholders the results of\nthe CCAR process, and thus to\naddress any market or investor\nperceptions, may be limited as\nthe FRB\u2019s assessment of Citi\u2019s\ncapital adequacy is conducted\nusing the FRB\u2019s proprietary\nstress test models. In\naddition, all CCAR firms,\nincluding Citi, will continue\nto be subject to a rigorous\nevaluation of their capital\nplanning practices, including,\nbut not limited to,\ngovernance, risk management\nand internal controls. For\nadditional information on\nlimitations on Citi\u2019s ability\nto return capital to common\nshareholders, as well as the\nCCAR process, supervisory\nstress test requirements and\nGSIB surcharge, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Overview\u201d and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Stress\nTesting\n\nComponent of Capital Planning\u201d\nabove and the risk management\nrisk factor below.\n\nThe FRB has stated that it\nexpects leading capital\nadequacy practices to continue\nto evolve and to likely be\ndetermined by the FRB each\nyear as a result of its cross-\nfirm review of capital plan\nsubmissions. Similarly, the\nFRB has indicated that, as\npart of its stated goal to\ncontinually evolve its annual\nstress testing requirements,\nseveral parameters of the\nannual stress testing process\nmay continue to be altered,\nincluding the severity of the\nstress test scenario, the FRB\nmodeling of Citi\u2019s balance\nsheet pre-provision net\nrevenue (PPNR) and stress\nlosses, and the addition of\ncomponents deemed important by\nthe FRB.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022,\nCiti will be required to phase\ninto regulatory capital at 25%\nper year the changes in\nretained earnings, deferred\ntax assets and ACL determined\nupon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date as well as\nsubsequent changes in the ACL\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The FRB has\nstated that it plans to\nmaintain its current framework\nfor calculating allowances on\nloans in the supervisory\nstress test for the 2021\nsupervisory stress test cycle,\nand to evaluate appropriate\nfuture enhancements to this\nframework as best practices\nfor implementing the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology are developed. The\nimpacts on Citi\u2019s capital\nadequacy of the FRB\u2019s\nincorporation of CECL in its\nsupervisory stress tests on an\nongoing basis, and of other\npotential regulatory changes\nin the FRB\u2019s stress testing\nmethodologies, remain unclear.\nFor additional information\nregarding the CECL\nmethodology, including the\ntransition provisions related\nto the adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Current Regulatory\nCapital Standards\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Treatment\u2014Modified\nTransition of the Current\nExpected Credit Losses (CECL)\nMethodology\u201d above and Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nIn addition, the FRB has\nintegrated the annual stress\ntesting requirements with\nongoing regulatory capital\nrequirements. For Citigroup,\nthe SCB rule replaced the\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer in Citi\u2019s\nongoing regulatory capital\nrequirements for the\nStandardized Approach capital\nratios. The SCB equals the\nmaximum decline in Citi\u2019s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio under a severely adverse\nscenario over a nine-quarter\nCCAR measurement period, plus\nfour quarters of planned\ncommon stock dividends,\nsubject to a minimum\nrequirement of 2.5%. Effective\nOctober 1, 2020, Citi\u2019s SCB\nwas 2.5%. The SCB is\ncalculated by the FRB using\nits proprietary data and\nmodeling of each firm\u2019s\nresults. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nSCB may change annually, or\npossibly more frequently,\nbased on the supervisory\nstress test results, thus\npotentially resulting in\nvolatility in the calculation\nof the SCB. Similar to the\nCapital Conservation Buffer, a\nbreach of the SCB would result\nin graduated limitations on\ncapital distributions. For\nadditional information on the\nSCB, including its\ncalculation, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nBuffers\u201d above.\n\nAlthough various uncertainties\nexist regarding the extent of,\nand the ultimate impact to\nCiti from, these changes to\nthe FRB\u2019s stress testing and\nCCAR regimes, these changes\ncould increase the level of\ncapital Citi is required or\nelects to hold,\n                               50                               \nincluding as part of Citi\u2019s\nmanagement buffer, thus\npotentially impacting the\nextent to which Citi is able\nto return capital to\nshareholders.\n\nCiti, Its Management and Its\nBusinesses Must Continually\nReview, Analyze and\nSuccessfully Adapt to Ongoing\nRegulatory and Legislative\nUncertainties and Changes in\nthe U.S. and Globally.\n\nDespite the adoption of final\nregulations and laws in\nnumerous areas impacting Citi\nand its businesses over the\npast several years, Citi, its\nmanagement and its businesses\ncontinually face ongoing\nregulatory and legislative\nuncertainties and changes,\nboth in the U.S. and globally.\nWhile the areas of ongoing\nregulatory and legislative\nuncertainties and changes\nfacing Citi are too numerous\nto list completely, various\nexamples include, but are not\nlimited to (i) potential\nfiscal, monetary, regulatory,\ntax and other changes arising\nfrom the U.S. federal\ngovernment and other\ngovernments, including as a\nresult of the new U.S.\npresidential administration,\nregulatory leadership and\nCongress or in response to the\npandemic; (ii) potential\nchanges to various aspects of\nthe regulatory capital\nframework and requirements\napplicable to Citi (see the\ncapital return risk factor and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards\nDevelopments\u201d above); and\n(iii) the future legislative\nand regulatory framework\nresulting from the U.K.\u2019s exit\nfrom the European Union (EU),\nincluding, among others, with\nrespect to financial services\n(see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Strategic Risk\u2014U.K.\u2019s\nFuture Relationship with the\nEU\u201d below). When referring to\n\u201cregulatory,\u201d Citi is\nincluding both formal\nregulation and the views and\nexpectations of its regulators\nin their supervisory roles.\n\nOngoing regulatory and\nlegislative uncertainties and\nchanges make Citi\u2019s and its\nmanagement\u2019s long-term\nbusiness, balance sheet and\nstrategic budget planning\ndifficult, subject to change\nand potentially more costly.\nU.S. and other regulators\nglobally have implemented and\ncontinue to discuss various\nchanges to certain regulatory\nrequirements, which would\nrequire ongoing assessment by\nmanagement as to the impact to\nCiti, its businesses and\nbusiness planning. For\nexample, while the Basel III\npost-crisis regulatory reforms\nand revised market risk\nframework have been finalized\nat the international level,\nthere remain significant\nuncertainties with respect to\nthe integration of these\nrevisions into the U.S.\nregulatory capital framework.\nBusiness planning is required\nto be based on possible or\nproposed rules or outcomes,\nwhich can change dramatically\nupon finalization, or upon\nimplementation or interpretive\nguidance from numerous\nregulatory bodies worldwide,\nand such guidance can change.\n\nMoreover, U.S. and\ninternational regulatory and\nlegislative initiatives have\nnot always been undertaken or\nimplemented on a coordinated\nbasis, and areas of divergence\nhave developed and continue to\ndevelop with respect to the\nscope, interpretation, timing,\nstructure or approach, leading\nto inconsistent or even\nconflicting requirements,\nincluding within a single\njurisdiction. For example, in\nMay 2019, the European\nCommission adopted, as part of\nCapital Requirements Directive\nV (CRD V), a new requirement\nfor major banking groups\nheadquartered outside the EU\n(which would include Citi) to\nestablish an intermediate EU\nholding company where the\nforeign bank has two or more\ninstitutions (broadly\n\nmeaning banks, broker-dealers\nand similar financial firms)\nestablished in the EU. While\nin some respects the\nrequirement mirrors an\nexisting U.S. requirement for\nnon-U.S. banking organizations\nto form U.S. intermediate\nholding companies, the\nimplementation of the EU\nholding company requirement\ncould lead to additional\ncomplexity with respect to\nCiti\u2019s resolution planning,\ncapital and liquidity\nallocation and efficiency in\nvarious jurisdictions.\n\nRegulatory and legislative\nchanges have also\nsignificantly increased Citi\u2019s\ncompliance risks and costs\n(see the implementation and\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges risk factor below).\n\nCiti\u2019s Continued Investments\nand Efficiency Initiatives May\nNot Be as Successful as It\nProjects or Expects.\n\nCiti continues to leverage its\nscale and make incremental\ninvestments to deepen client\nrelationships, increase\nrevenues and lower expenses,\nas well as significant\ninvestments to transform its\ninfrastructure, risk\nmanagement and controls and\nfurther enhance safety and\nsoundness (for additional\ninformation, see the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below). For example,\nCiti continues to make\ninvestments to enhance its\ndigital capabilities across\nthe franchise, including\ndigital platforms and mobile\nand cloud-based solutions.\nCiti also has been making\ninvestments across the firm,\nsuch as in the U.S. consumer\nfranchise, Citi\u2019s wealth\nmanagement businesses and\ntreasury and trade solutions,\nsecurities services and other\nbusinesses in ICG , including\nimplementing new capabilities\nand partnerships. Further,\nCiti has been pursuing\nefficiency improvements\nthrough various technology and\ndigital initiatives,\norganizational simplification\nand location strategies.\n\nCiti\u2019s investments and\nefficiency initiatives are\nbeing undertaken as part of\nits overall strategy to meet\noperational and financial\nobjectives, including, among\nothers, those relating to\nshareholder returns.\nAdditionally, in connection\nwith Citi\u2019s CEO transition,\nCiti is undergoing an\nevaluation of its strategy,\nwhich may result in, among\nother things, additional\ninvestments as well as changes\nin or exits of businesses.\nThere is no guarantee that\nthese or other initiatives\nCiti may pursue will be as\nproductive or effective as\nCiti expects, or at all.\nAdditionally, such initiatives\ncould result in losses,\ncharges or other negative\nfinancial impacts. Citi\u2019s\ninvestment and efficiency\ninitiatives may continue to\nevolve as its business\nstrategies, the market\nenvironment and regulatory\nexpectations change, which\ncould make the initiatives\nmore costly and more\nchallenging to implement, and\nlimit their effectiveness.\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s ability to\nachieve expected returns on\nits investments and costs\nsavings depends, in part, on\nfactors that it cannot\ncontrol, such as macroeconomic\nconditions, including the\nnegative impacts related to\nthe pandemic, customer, client\nand competitor actions and\nongoing regulatory changes,\namong others.\n\nUncertainties Regarding the\nTransition Away from or\nDiscontinuance of the London\nInter-Bank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) or Any Other Interest\nRate Benchmark Could Have\nAdverse Consequences for\nMarket Participants, Including\nCiti.\n\nLIBOR continues to be widely\nused as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d or\n\u201creference rate\u201d across\nfinancial products and markets\n                               51                               \nglobally. Based on statements\nfrom U.S. and U.K.\nauthorities, it is expected,\nhowever, that all non-U.S.\ndollar LIBOR tenors and some\nUSD LIBOR tenors will cease\nafter December 31, 2021, while\nmost U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors\nwill continue to be quoted\nthrough June 2023. As a result\nof LIBOR\u2019s wide use, there can\nbe no assurance that market\nparticipants, including Citi,\nwill be able to successfully\nmodify all outstanding LIBOR-\nbased securities or products\nor be sufficiently prepared\nfor all of the uncertainties\nresulting from LIBOR\u2019s\ndiscontinuance. In addition,\nfollowing guidance provided by\nthe Financial Stability Board,\nregulators have suggested\nreforming or replacing other\nbenchmark rates with\nalternative reference rates.\nThe transition away from and\ndiscontinuance of LIBOR or any\nother benchmark rate presents\nvarious uncertainties, risks\nand challenges to holders of\nLIBOR-based securities and\nproducts as well as financial\nmarkets and institutions,\nincluding Citi. These include,\namong others, the pricing,\nliquidity, value of, return on\nand market for financial\ninstruments and contracts that\nreference LIBOR or any other\nbenchmark rate, including any\nalternative benchmark rate.\n\nDespite ongoing actions by\nCiti to prepare for the\ntransition away from LIBOR\n(see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Strategic Risk\u2014LIBOR\nTransition Risk\u201d below), Citi\nhas continued to meet market\ndemand by trading, holding or\notherwise using a substantial\namount of securities or\nproducts that reference LIBOR,\nincluding, among others,\nderivatives, corporate loans,\ncommercial and residential\nmortgages, credit cards,\nsecuritized products and other\nstructured securities. The\ntransition away from and\ndiscontinuation of LIBOR for\nthese securities and products\npresents significant\noperational, legal,\nreputational or compliance,\nfinancial and other risks to\nCiti.\n\nFor example, the LIBOR\ntransition presents various\nchallenges related to\ncontractual mechanics of\nexisting floating rate\nfinancial instruments and\ncontracts that reference LIBOR\nand mature after\ndiscontinuance of the relevant\nLIBOR. Certain of these legacy\ninstruments and contracts do\nnot provide for alternative\nbenchmark rates, which makes\nit unclear what the future\nbenchmark rates would be after\nLIBOR\u2019s cessation. Further,\nCiti may not be able to amend\ncertain instruments and\ncontracts due to an inability\nto obtain sufficient required\nconsent from counterparties or\nsecurity holders. Even if the\ninstruments and contracts\nprovide for a transition to\nalternative benchmark rates,\nthe new benchmark rates may,\nparticularly in times of\nfinancial stress,\nsignificantly differ from the\nprior rates. As a result, Citi\nmay need to proactively\naddress any contractual\nuncertainties or rate\ndifferences in such\ninstruments and contracts,\nwhich would likely be both\ntime consuming and costly, and\nmay not ultimately be\nsuccessful.\n\nIn addition, the transition\naway from and discontinuance\nof LIBOR could result in\ndisputes, including\nlitigation, involving holders\nof outstanding instruments and\ncontracts that reference\nLIBOR, whether or not the\nunderlying documentation\nprovides for alternative\nbenchmark rates. Citi will\nalso need to further invest in\nand develop significant\ninternal systems and\ninfrastructure to transition\nto alternative benchmark rates\nto manage its businesses and\nsupport its clients.\n\nCiti\u2019s Ability to Utilize Its\nDTAs, and Thus Reduce the\nNegative Impact of the DTAs on\nCiti\u2019s Regulatory Capital,\nWill Be Driven by Its Ability\nto Generate U.S. Taxable\nIncome.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, Citi\u2019s\nnet DTAs were $24.8 billion,\nnet of a valuation allowance\nof $5.2 billion, of which $9.5\nbillion was excluded from\nCiti\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules, primarily relating\nto net operating losses,\nforeign tax credit and general\nbusiness credit carry-forwards\n(for additional information,\nsee \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Components of\nCitigroup Capital\u201d above). Of\nthe net DTAs at December 31,\n2020, $4.4 billion related to\nforeign tax credit carry-\nforwards (FTCs), net of a\nvaluation allowance. The\ncarry-forward utilization\nperiod for FTCs is ten years\nand represents the most time-\nsensitive component of Citi\u2019s\nDTAs. The FTC carry-forwards\nat December 31, 2020 expire\nover the period of 2021\u20132029.\nCiti must utilize any FTCs\ngenerated in the then-current-\nyear tax return prior to\nutilizing any carry-forward\nFTCs.\n\nThe accounting treatment for\nrealization of DTAs, including\nFTCs, is complex and requires\nsignificant judgment and\nestimates regarding future\ntaxable earnings in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise and available tax\nplanning strategies. Forecasts\nof future taxable earnings\nwill depend upon various\nfactors, including, among\nothers, the continued impact\nof the pandemic and other\nmacroeconomic conditions. In\naddition, any future increase\nin U.S. corporate tax rates\ncould result in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s DTA, which may subject\nmore of Citi\u2019s existing DTA to\nexclusion from regulatory\ncapital while improving Citi\u2019s\nability to utilize its FTC\ncarry-forwards. Citi\u2019s overall\nability to realize its DTAs\nwill primarily be dependent\nupon its ability to generate\nU.S. taxable income in the\nrelevant tax carry-forward\nperiods. Although utilization\nof FTCs in any year is\ngenerally limited to 21% of\nforeign source taxable income\nin that year, overall domestic\nlosses (ODL) that Citi has\nincurred in the past allow it\nto reclassify domestic source\nincome as foreign source.\nFailure to realize any portion\nof the net DTAs would have a\ncorresponding negative impact\non Citi\u2019s net income and\nfinancial returns.\n\nCiti does not expect to be\nsubject to the Base Erosion\nAnti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), which,\nif applicable to Citi in any\ngiven year, would have a\nsignificantly adverse effect\non both Citi\u2019s net income and\nregulatory capital.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s DTAs, including FTCs,\nsee \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d below\nand Notes 1 and 9 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nCiti\u2019s Interpretation or\nApplication of the Complex Tax\nLaws to Which It Is Subject\nCould Differ from Those of the\nRelevant Governmental\nAuthorities, Which Could\nResult in the Payment of\nAdditional Taxes, Penalties or\nInterest.\n\nCiti is subject to various\nincome-based tax laws of the\nU.S. and its states and\nmunicipalities, as well as the\nnumerous non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which it\noperates. These tax laws are\ninherently complex and Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these laws,\nincluding the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act (Tax Reform), to its\nentities, operations and\nbusinesses. In addition, Citi\nis subject to\n                               52                               \nlitigation or examinations\nwith U.S. and non-U.S. tax\nauthorities regarding non-\nincome-based tax matters.\nCiti\u2019s interpretations or\napplication of the tax laws,\nincluding with respect to Tax\nReform, withholding, stamp,\nservice and other non-income\ntaxes, could differ from that\nof the relevant governmental\ntaxing authority, which could\nresult in the requirement to\npay additional taxes,\npenalties or interest, which\ncould be material. For\nadditional information on the\nlitigation and examinations\ninvolving non-U.S. tax\nauthorities, see Note 27 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nCiti\u2019s Presence in the\nEmerging Markets Subjects It\nto Various Risks as well as\nIncreased Compliance and\nRegulatory Risks and Costs.\n\nDuring 2020, emerging markets\nrevenues accounted for\napproximately 34% of Citi\u2019s\ntotal revenues (Citi generally\ndefines emerging markets as\ncountries in Latin America ,\nAsia (other than Japan,\nAustralia and New Zealand),\nand central and Eastern\nEurope, the Middle East and\nAfrica in EMEA ). Although\nCiti continues to pursue its\ntarget client strategy, Citi\u2019s\npresence in the emerging\nmarkets subjects it to various\nrisks, such as limitations of\nhedges on foreign investments;\nforeign currency volatility,\nincluding devaluations,\nsovereign volatility, election\noutcomes, regulatory changes\nand political events; foreign\nexchange controls; limitations\non foreign investment;\nsociopolitical instability\n(including from\nhyperinflation); fraud;\nnationalization or loss of\nlicenses; business\nrestrictions; sanctions or\nasset freezes; potential\ncriminal charges; closure of\nbranches or subsidiaries; and\nconfiscation of assets, and\nthese risks can be exacerbated\nin the event of a\ndeterioration in relationships\nbetween the U.S. and an\nemerging market country. For\nexample, Citi operates in\nseveral countries that have,\nor have had in the past,\nstrict capital and currency\ncontrols, such as Argentina,\nthat limit its ability to\nconvert local currency into\nU.S. dollars and/or transfer\nfunds outside of those\ncountries (for further\ninformation, see \u201cStrategic\nRisk\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nbelow).\n\nMoreover, if the economic\nsituation in an emerging\nmarkets country where Citi\noperates were to deteriorate\nbelow a certain level, U.S.\nregulators may impose\nmandatory loan loss or other\nreserve requirements on Citi,\nwhich would increase its\ncredit costs and decrease its\nearnings (for further\ninformation, see \u201cStrategic\nRisk\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nbelow). In addition, political\nturmoil and instability have\noccurred in certain regions\nand countries, including Asia\n, the Middle East and Latin\nAmerica , which have required,\nand may continue to require,\nmanagement time and attention\nand other resources (such as\nmonitoring the impact of\nsanctions on certain emerging\nmarkets economies as well as\nimpacting Citi\u2019s businesses\nand results of operations in\naffected countries).\n\nCiti\u2019s emerging markets\npresence also increases its\ncompliance and regulatory\nrisks and costs. For example,\nCiti\u2019s operations in emerging\nmarkets, including\nfacilitating cross-border\ntransactions on behalf of its\nclients, subject it to higher\ncompliance risks under U.S.\nregulations that are primarily\nfocused on various aspects of\nglobal corporate activities,\nsuch as anti-money laundering\nregulations and the Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act. These\nrisks can be more acute in\nless developed\n\nmarkets and thus require\nsubstantial investment in\ncompliance infrastructure or\ncould result in a reduction in\ncertain of Citi\u2019s business\nactivities. Any failure by\nCiti to comply with applicable\nU.S. regulations, as well as\nthe regulations in the\ncountries and markets in which\nit operates as a result of its\nglobal footprint, could\nresult, even if the\nregulations require\ninconsistent results, in legal\nor regulatory proceedings,\nfines, penalties, injunctions\nor other similar restrictions,\nmany of which could negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and reputation (see\nthe implementation and\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges and legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactors below).\n\nA Deterioration in or Failure\nto Maintain Citi\u2019s Co-\nBranding or Private Label\nCredit Card Relationships,\nIncluding as a Result of Any\nBankruptcy or Liquidation,\nCould Have a Negative Impact\non Citi\u2019s Results of\nOperations or Financial\nCondition.\n\nCiti has co-branding and\nprivate label relationships\nthrough its Citi-branded cards\nand Citi retail services\ncredit card businesses with\nvarious retailers and\nmerchants globally, whereby in\nthe ordinary course of\nbusiness Citi issues credit\ncards to customers of the\nretailers or merchants. Citi\u2019s\nco-branding and private label\nagreements provide for shared\neconomics between the parties\nand generally have a fixed\nterm. The five largest\nrelationships across both\nbusinesses in North America\nGCB constituted an aggregate\nof approximately 10% of Citi\u2019s\nrevenues in 2020 (for\nadditional information, see \u201c\nGlobal Consumer Banking \u2014\nNorth America GCB \u201d above).\n\nOver the last several years, a\nnumber of U.S. retailers have\ncontinued to experience\ndeclining sales, which has\nresulted in significant\nnumbers of store closures and,\nin a number of cases,\nbankruptcies, as retailers\nattempt to cut costs and\nreorganize. The pandemic has\nexacerbated these trends\n\nand generally resulted in a\nchallenging operating\nenvironment\n\nfor retailers and merchants.\nIn addition, as has been\nwidely reported, competition\namong card issuers, including\nCiti, for these relationships\nis significant, and it has\nbecome increasingly difficult\nin recent years to maintain\nsuch relationships on the same\nterms or at all.\n\nCiti\u2019s co-branding and private\nlabel relationships could\ncontinue to be negatively\nimpacted by, among other\nthings, the general economic\nenvironment; declining sales\nand revenues, partner store\nclosures, government imposed\nrestrictions, reduced air and\nbusiness travel, or other\noperational difficulties of\nthe retailer or merchant;\ntermination due to a\ncontractual breach by Citi or\nby the retailer or merchant;\nor other factors, including\nbankruptcies, liquidations,\nrestructurings, consolidations\nor other similar events,\nwhether due to the ongoing\nimpact of the pandemic or\notherwise (see the pandemic-\nrelated risk factor above).\n\nWhile various mitigating\nfactors could be available to\nCiti if any of the above\nevents were to occur\u2014such as\nby replacing the retailer or\nmerchant or offering other\ncard products\u2014these events,\nparticularly bankruptcies or\nliquidations, could negatively\nimpact the results of\noperations or financial\ncondition of Citi-branded\ncards, Citi retail services or\nCiti as a whole, including as\na result of loss of revenues,\nincreased expenses, higher\ncost of credit, impairment of\npurchased credit\n                               53                               \ncard relationships and\ncontract-related intangibles\nor other losses (for\ninformation on Citi\u2019s credit\ncard related intangibles\ngenerally, see Note 16 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements).\n\nCiti\u2019s Inability in Its\nResolution Plan Submissions to\nAddress Any Shortcomings or\nDeficiencies Identified or\nGuidance Provided by the FRB\nand FDIC Could Subject Citi to\nMore Stringent Capital,\nLeverage or Liquidity\nRequirements, or Restrictions\non Its Growth, Activities or\nOperations, and Could\nEventually Require Citi to\nDivest Assets or Operations.\n\nTitle I of the Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires Citi to prepare and\nsubmit a plan to the FRB and\nthe FDIC for the orderly\nresolution of Citigroup (the\nbank holding company) and its\nsignificant legal entities\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\nin the event of future\nmaterial financial distress or\nfailure. On December 17, 2019,\nthe FRB and FDIC issued\nfeedback on the resolution\nplans filed on July 1, 2019 by\nthe eight U.S. GSIBs,\nincluding Citi. The FRB and\nFDIC identified one\nshortcoming, but no\ndeficiencies, in Citi\u2019s\nresolution plan relating to\ngovernance mechanisms. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s resolution plan\nsubmissions, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nUnder Title I, if the FRB and\nthe FDIC jointly determine\nthat Citi\u2019s resolution plan is\nnot \u201ccredible\u201d (which,\nalthough not defined, is\ngenerally believed to mean the\nregulators do not believe the\nplan is feasible or would\notherwise allow Citi to be\nresolved in a way that\nprotects systemically\nimportant functions without\nsevere systemic disruption),\nor would not facilitate an\norderly resolution of Citi\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, and Citi fails to\nresubmit a resolution plan\nthat remedies any identified\ndeficiencies, Citi could be\nsubjected to more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements, or restrictions\non its growth, activities or\noperations. If within two\nyears from the imposition of\nany such requirements or\nrestrictions Citi has still\nnot remediated any identified\ndeficiencies, then Citi could\neventually be required to\ndivest certain assets or\noperations. Any such\nrestrictions or actions would\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nreputation, market and\ninvestor perception,\noperations and strategy.\n\nCiti\u2019s Performance and the\nPerformance of Its Individual\nBusinesses Could Be Negatively\nImpacted if Citi Is Not Able\nto Effectively Compete for,\nRetain and Motivate Highly\nQualified Colleagues.\n\nCiti\u2019s performance and the\nperformance of its individual\nbusinesses largely depend on\nthe talents and efforts of its\ndiverse and highly qualified\ncolleagues. Specifically,\nCiti\u2019s continued ability to\ncompete in each of its lines\nof business, to manage its\nbusinesses effectively and to\nexecute its global strategy\ndepends on its ability to\nattract new colleagues and to\nretain and motivate its\nexisting colleagues. If Citi\nis unable to continue to\nattract, retain and motivate\nthe most highly qualified\ncolleagues, Citi\u2019s\nperformance, including its\ncompetitive position, the\nexecution of its strategy and\nits results of operations\ncould be negatively impacted.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to attract,\nretain and motivate colleagues\ndepends on numerous factors,\nsome of which are outside of\nits\n\ncontrol. For example, the\nbanking industry generally is\nsubject to more comprehensive\nregulation of employee\ncompensation than other\nindustries, including deferral\nand clawback requirements for\nincentive compensation. Citi\noften competes for talent with\nentities that are not subject\nto similar regulatory\nrequirements, including, among\nothers, technology companies.\nOther factors that could\nimpact Citi\u2019s ability to\nattract, retain and motivate\ncolleagues include its\nreputation, culture and the\nmanagement and leadership of\nthe Company and each of its\nlines of business, presence in\na particular market or region\nand the professional\nopportunities it offers. For\ninformation on\n\nCiti\u2019s colleagues and\nworkforce management, see\n\u201cHuman\n\nCapital Resources and\nManagement\u201d below.\n\nFinancial Services Companies\nand Others as well as Emerging\nTechnologies Pose Increasingly\nCompetitive Challenges to\nCiti.\n\nCiti operates in an\nincreasingly competitive\nenvironment, which includes\nboth financial and non-\nfinancial services firms, such\nas traditional banks, online\nbanks, financial technology\ncompanies and others. These\ncompanies compete on the basis\nof, among other factors, size,\nreach, quality and type of\nproducts and services offered,\nprice, technology and\nreputation. Emerging\ntechnologies have the\npotential to intensify\ncompetition and accelerate\ndisruption in the financial\nservices industry.\n\nCiti competes with financial\nservices companies in the U.S.\nand globally that continue to\ndevelop and introduce new\nproducts and services. In\nrecent years, non-financial\nservices firms, such as\nfinancial technology\ncompanies, have begun to offer\nservices traditionally\nprovided by financial\ninstitutions, such as Citi,\nand have sought bank charters\nto provide these services.\nThese firms attempt to use\ntechnology and mobile\nplatforms to enhance the\nability of companies and\nindividuals to borrow, save\nand invest money. In addition,\nas discussed\n\nabove, it is unclear how the\nmacroeconomic business\n\nenvironment or societal norms\nmay be impacted as a result of\n\nthe pandemic. Citi may\nexperience increased or\ndifferent\n\ncompetitive and other\nchallenges in a post-pandemic\n\nenvironment.\n\nTo the extent that Citi is not\nable to compete effectively\nwith financial technology\ncompanies and other firms,\nCiti could be placed at a\ncompetitive disadvantage,\nwhich could result in loss of\ncustomers and market share,\nand its businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition could suffer. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s competitors, see the\nco-brand and private label\ncards risk factor above and\n\u201cSupervision, Regulation and\nOther\u2014Competition\u201d below.\n\nClimate Change Could Have a\nNegative Impact on Citi\u2019s\nResults of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\n\nCiti operates globally,\nincluding in countries, states\nand regions where its\nbusinesses, and the activities\nof its consumer customers and\ncorporate clients, could be\nnegatively impacted by climate\nchange. Climate change\npresents both immediate and\nlong-term risks to Citi and\nits customers and clients,\nwith the risks expected to\nincrease over time.\n\nClimate risks can arise from\nphysical risks (acute or\nchronic risks related to the\nphysical effects of climate\nchange) and transition risks\n(risks related to regulatory\nand legal,\n                               54                               \ntechnological, market and\nreputational changes from a\ntransition to a low-carbon\neconomy). Physical risks could\ndamage or destroy Citi\u2019s or\nits customers\u2019 and clients\u2019\nproperties and other assets\nand disrupt their operations.\nFor example, climate change\nmay lead to more extreme\nweather events occurring more\noften which may result in\nphysical damage and additional\nvolatility within our trading\nand other businesses and\npotential counterparty\nexposures and other financial\nrisks. Transition risks may\nresult in changes in\nregulations or market\npreferences, which in turn\ncould have negative impacts on\nasset values, results of\noperation or the reputation of\nCiti and its customers and\nclients. For example, Citi\u2019s\ncorporate credit portfolios\ninclude carbon-intensive\nindustries like oil and gas\nand power that are exposed to\nclimate risks, such as those\nrisks related to the\ntransition to a low-carbon\neconomy, as well as low-carbon\nindustries that may be subject\nto risks associated with new\ntechnologies. U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banking regulators\nand others have increasingly\nviewed financial institutions\nas important in helping to\naddress the risks related to\nclimate change both directly\nand with respect to their\ncustomers. Ongoing legislative\nor regulatory uncertainties\nand changes regarding climate\nrisk management and practices\nmay result in higher\nregulatory, compliance, credit\nand reputational risks and\ncosts.\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nmanagement of climate risk,\nsee \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Strategic Risk\u2014Climate\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  MARKET AND OTHER RISKS                                        \n                                                                \nMacroeconomic, Geopolitical\nand Other Challenges and\nUncertainties Globally Could\nHave a Negative Impact on\nCiti\u2019s Businesses and Results\nof Operations.\n\nIn addition to the significant\nmacroeconomic challenges posed\nby the pandemic (see the\npandemic-related risk factor\nabove), Citi has experienced,\nand could experience in the\nfuture, negative impacts to\nits businesses and results of\noperations as a result of\nother macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nchallenges, uncertainties and\nvolatility. For example,\ngovernmental fiscal and\nmonetary actions, or expected\nactions, such as changes in\ninterest rate policies and any\nprogram implemented by a\ncentral bank to change the\nsize of its balance sheet,\ncould significantly impact\ninterest rates, economic\ngrowth rates, the volatility\nof global financial markets,\nforeign exchange rates and\nglobal capital flows.\nAdditional areas of\nuncertainty include, among\nothers, geopolitical tensions\nand conflicts, protracted or\nwidespread trade tensions,\nnatural disasters, other\npandemics and election\noutcomes. Moreover, adverse\ndevelopments or downturns in\none or more of the world\u2019s\nlarger economies would likely\nhave a significant impact on\nthe global economy or the\neconomies of other countries\nbecause of global financial\nand economic linkages.\n\nIn 2020, due to the pandemic,\nthe FRB and other central\nbanks took numerous actions to\nsupport the global economy,\nincluding by further reducing\ntheir benchmark interest rates\nand in certain instances\nproviding additional liquidity\nto the financial system.\nInterest rates on loans Citi\nmakes to customers and clients\nare typically based off or set\nat a spread over a benchmark\ninterest rate, including the\nU.S. benchmark interest rate,\nand are therefore likely to\ndecline as benchmark\n\nrates decline. By contrast,\nthe interest rates at which\nCiti pays depositors are\nalready low and unlikely to\ndecline much further.\nConsequently, declining or\ncontinued low interest rates\nfor loans and largely\nunchanged deposit rates would\nlikely further compress Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue. Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue could\nalso be adversely affected due\nto a flattening of the\ninterest rate yield curve\n(e.g., a lower spread between\nshorter-term versus longer-\nterm interest rates), as Citi,\nsimilar to other banks,\ntypically pays interest on\ndeposits based on shorter-term\ninterest rates and earns money\non loans based on longer-term\ninterest rates. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s interest\nrate risk, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Market Risk\u2014Net\nInterest Revenue at Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nThese and additional global\nmacroeconomic, geopolitical\nand other challenges,\nuncertainties and volatilities\nhave negatively impacted, and\ncould continue to negatively\nimpact, Citi\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition, including\nits credit costs, revenues\nacross ICG and GCB and AOCI\n(which would in turn\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s book\nand tangible book value).\n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISKS                                             \n                                                                \nA Failure in or Disruption of\nCiti\u2019s Operational Processes\nor Systems Could Negatively\nImpact Citi\u2019s Reputation,\nCustomers, Clients, Businesses\nor Results of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\n\nCiti\u2019s global operations rely\nheavily on the accurate,\ntimely and secure processing,\nmanagement, storage and\ntransmission of confidential\ntransactions, data and other\ninformation as well as the\nmonitoring of a substantial\namount of data and complex\ntransactions in real time. For\nexample, Citi obtains and\nstores an extensive amount of\npersonal and client-specific\ninformation for its consumer\nand institutional customers\nand clients, and must\naccurately record and reflect\ntheir extensive account\ntransactions. Citi\u2019s\noperations must also comply\nwith complex and evolving laws\nand regulations in the\ncountries in which it\noperates.\n\nWith the evolving\nproliferation of new\ntechnologies and the\nincreasing use of the\ninternet, mobile devices and\ncloud technologies to conduct\nfinancial transactions, large\nglobal financial institutions\nsuch as Citi have been, and\nwill continue to be, subject\nto an ever-increasing risk of\noperational loss, failure or\ndisruption, including as a\nresult of cyber or information\nsecurity incidents. These\nrisks have been exacerbated\nduring the pandemic, when a\nsubstantial portion of Citi\u2019s\ncolleagues have worked\nremotely and customers and\nclients have increased their\nuse of online banking and\nother platforms (for\nadditional information, see\nthe cybersecurity risk factor\nbelow and pandemic-related\nrisk factor above).\n\nAlthough Citi has continued to\nupgrade its operational\nsystems to automate processes\nand enhance efficiencies,\noperational incidents are\nunpredictable and can arise\nfrom numerous sources, not all\nof which are within Citi\u2019s\ncontrol, including, among\nothers, human error, such as\nprocessing errors, fraud or\nmalice on the part of\nemployees or third parties,\naccidental system or\ntechnological failure,\nelectrical or\ntelecommunication outages,\nfailures of or cyber incidents\ninvolving computer servers or\ninfrastructure or other\nsimilar losses or damage to\nCiti\u2019s property or assets.\nIrrespective of the\nsophistication of the\ntechnology utilized by Citi,\nthere will\n                               55                               \nalways be some room for human\nerror. In view of the large\ntransactions in which Citi\nengages, such errors could\nresult in significant loss.\nOperational incidents can also\narise as a result of failures\nby third parties with which\nCiti does business, such as\nfailures by internet, mobile\ntechnology and cloud service\nproviders or other vendors to\nadequately follow procedures\nor processes, safeguard their\nsystems or prevent system\ndisruptions or cyber attacks.\n\nIncidents that impact\ninformation security and/or\ntechnology operations may\ncause disruptions and/or\nmalfunctions within Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses (e.g., the\ntemporary loss of availability\nof Citi\u2019s online banking\nsystem or mobile banking\nplatform), as well as the\noperations of its clients,\ncustomers or other third\nparties. In addition,\noperational incidents could\ninvolve the failure or\nineffectiveness of internal\nprocesses or controls. Given\nCiti\u2019s global footprint and\nthe high volume of\ntransactions processed by\nCiti, certain failures, errors\nor actions may be repeated or\ncompounded before they are\ndiscovered and rectified,\nwhich would further increase\nthe consequences and costs.\nOperational incidents could\nresult in financial losses as\nwell as misappropriation,\ncorruption or loss of\nconfidential and other\ninformation or assets, which\ncould significantly negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation,\ncustomers, clients, businesses\nor results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Cyber-\nrelated and other operational\nincidents can also result in\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings, fines and other\ncosts (see the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below).\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nmanagement of operational\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s and Third Parties\u2019\nComputer Systems and Networks\nHave Been, and Will Continue\nto Be, Susceptible to an\nIncreasing Risk of Continually\nEvolving, Sophisticated\nCybersecurity Activities That\nCould Result in the Theft,\nLoss, Misuse or Disclosure of\nConfidential Client or\nCustomer Information, Damage\nto Citi\u2019s Reputation,\nAdditional Costs to Citi,\nRegulatory Penalties, Legal\nExposure and Financial Losses.\n\nCiti\u2019s computer systems,\nsoftware and networks are\nsubject to ongoing cyber\nincidents such as unauthorized\naccess, loss or destruction of\ndata (including confidential\nclient information), account\ntakeovers, unavailability of\nservice, computer viruses or\nother malicious code, cyber\nattacks and other similar\nevents. These threats can\narise from external parties,\nincluding cyber criminals,\ncyber terrorists, hacktivists\nand nation state actors, as\nwell as insiders who knowingly\nor unknowingly engage in or\nenable malicious cyber\nactivities.\n\nThird parties with which Citi\ndoes business, as well as\nretailers and other third\nparties with which Citi\u2019s\ncustomers do business, may\nalso be sources of\ncybersecurity risks,\nparticularly where activities\nof customers are beyond Citi\u2019s\nsecurity and control systems.\nFor example, Citi outsources\ncertain functions, such as\nprocessing customer credit\ncard transactions, uploading\ncontent on customer-facing\nwebsites and developing\nsoftware for new products and\nservices. These relationships\nallow for the storage and\nprocessing of customer\ninformation by third-party\nhosting of or access to Citi\nwebsites, which could lead to\ncompromise or the potential to\nintroduce vulnerable or\nmalicious code, resulting in\nsecurity\n\nbreaches impacting Citi\ncustomers. Furthermore,\nbecause financial institutions\nare becoming increasingly\ninterconnected with central\nagents, exchanges and clearing\nhouses, including as a result\nof derivatives reforms over\nthe last few years, Citi has\nincreased exposure to cyber\nattacks through third parties.\nWhile many of Citi\u2019s\nagreements with third parties\ninclude indemnification\nprovisions, Citi may not be\nable to recover sufficiently,\nor at all, under the\nprovisions to adequately\noffset any losses Citi may\nincur from third-party cyber\nincidents.\n\nCiti has been subject to\nattempted and sometimes\nsuccessful cyber attacks from\nexternal sources over the last\nseveral years, including (i)\ndenial of service attacks,\nwhich attempt to interrupt\nservice to clients and\ncustomers, (ii) hacking and\nmalicious software\ninstallations, intended to\ngain unauthorized access to\ninformation systems or to\ndisrupt those systems, (iii)\ndata breaches due to\nunauthorized access to\ncustomer account data and (iv)\nmalicious software attacks on\nclient systems, in an attempt\nto gain unauthorized access to\nCiti systems or client data\nunder the guise of normal\nclient transactions. While\nCiti\u2019s monitoring and\nprotection services were able\nto detect and respond to the\nincidents targeting its\nsystems before they became\nsignificant, they still\nresulted in limited losses in\nsome instances as well as\nincreases in expenditures to\nmonitor against the threat of\nsimilar future cyber\nincidents. There can be no\nassurance that such cyber\nincidents will not occur\nagain, and they could occur\nmore frequently and on a more\nsignificant scale.\n\nFurther, although Citi devotes\nsignificant resources to\nimplement, maintain, monitor\nand regularly upgrade its\nsystems and networks with\nmeasures such as intrusion\ndetection and prevention and\nfirewalls to safeguard\ncritical business\napplications, there is no\nguarantee that these measures\nor any other measures can\nprovide absolute security.\nBecause the methods used to\ncause cyber attacks change\nfrequently or, in some cases,\nare not recognized until\nlaunched or even later, Citi\nmay be unable to implement\neffective preventive measures\nor proactively address these\nmethods until they are\ndiscovered. In addition, given\nthe evolving nature of cyber\nthreat actors and the\nfrequency and sophistication\nof the cyber activities they\ncarry out, the determination\nof the severity and potential\nimpact of a cyber incident may\nnot become apparent for a\nsubstantial period of time\nfollowing discovery of the\nincident. Also, while Citi\nengages in certain actions to\nreduce the exposure resulting\nfrom outsourcing, such as\nperforming security control\nassessments of third-party\nvendors and limiting third-\nparty access to the least\nprivileged level necessary to\nperform job functions, these\nactions cannot prevent all\nthird-party-related cyber\nattacks or data breaches.\n\nCyber incidents can result in\nthe disclosure of personal,\nconfidential or proprietary\ncustomer or client\ninformation, damage to Citi\u2019s\nreputation with its clients\nand the market, customer\ndissatisfaction and additional\ncosts to Citi, including\nexpenses such as repairing\nsystems, replacing customer\npayment cards, credit\nmonitoring or adding new\npersonnel or protection\ntechnologies. Regulatory\npenalties, loss of revenues,\nexposure to litigation and\nother financial losses,\nincluding loss of funds, to\nboth Citi and its clients and\ncustomers and disruption to\nCiti\u2019s operational systems\ncould also result from cyber\nincidents (for additional\ninformation on\n                               56                               \nthe potential impact of\noperational disruptions, see\nthe operational processes and\nsystems risk factor above).\nMoreover, the increasing risk\nof cyber incidents has\nresulted in increased\nlegislative and regulatory\nscrutiny of firms\u2019\ncybersecurity protection\nservices and calls for\nadditional laws and\nregulations to further enhance\nprotection of consumers\u2019\npersonal data.\n\nWhile Citi maintains insurance\ncoverage that may, subject to\npolicy terms and conditions\nincluding significant self-\ninsured deductibles, cover\ncertain aspects of cyber\nrisks, such insurance coverage\nmay be insufficient to cover\nall losses and may not take\ninto account reputational\nharm, the cost of which could\nbe immeasurable.\n\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s management of\ncybersecurity risk, see\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational\nRisk\u2014Cybersecurity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nChanges to or the Application\nof Incorrect Assumptions,\nJudgments or Estimates in\nCiti\u2019s Financial Statements\nCould Cause Significant\nUnexpected Losses or Impacts\nin the Future.\n\nU.S. GAAP requires Citi to use\ncertain assumptions, judgments\nand estimates in preparing its\nfinancial statements,\nincluding, among other items,\nthe estimate of the ACL;\nreserves related to\nlitigation, regulatory and tax\nmatters exposures; valuation\nof DTAs; and the fair values\nof certain assets and\nliabilities, such as goodwill\nor any other asset for\nimpairment. If Citi\u2019s\nassumptions, judgments or\nestimates underlying its\nfinancial statements are\nincorrect or differ from\nactual or subsequent events,\nCiti could experience\nunexpected losses or other\nadverse impacts, some of which\ncould be significant.\n\nFor example, the CECL\nmethodology, adopted as of\nJanuary 1, 2020, requires that\nCiti provide reserves for a\ncurrent estimate of lifetime\nexpected credit losses for its\nloan portfolios and other\nfinancial assets, as\napplicable, at the time those\nassets are originated or\nacquired. This estimate is\nadjusted each period for\nchanges in expected lifetime\ncredit losses. Citi\u2019s ACL\nestimate depends upon its CECL\nmodels and assumptions,\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions, including, among\nother things, the U.S.\nunemployment rate and the U.S.\nReal GDP, and the credit\nindicators, composition and\nother characteristics of\nCiti\u2019s loan and other\napplicable portfolios. These\nmodel assumptions and\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions will change over\ntime, whether due to the\npandemic or otherwise,\nresulting in greater\nvariability in Citi\u2019s ACL\ncompared to its provision for\nloan losses under the previous\nGAAP methodology, and, thus,\nimpact its results of\noperations, as well as\nregulatory capital, including\nas the CECL phase-in begins as\nof January 1, 2022.\n\nMoreover, Citi has incurred\nlosses related to its foreign\noperations that are reported\nin the foreign currency\ntranslation adjustment (CTA)\ncomponents of Accumulated\nother comprehensive income\n(loss) (AOCI) . In accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, a sale or\nsubstantial liquidation of any\nforeign operations, such as\nthose related to Citi\u2019s legacy\nbusinesses, would result in\nreclassification of any\nforeign CTA component of AOCI\nrelated to that foreign\noperation, including related\nhedges and taxes, into Citi\u2019s\nearnings. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\naccounting policy for foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation and its foreign\nCTA components of AOCI , see\nNotes 1 and 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe key areas for which\nassumptions and estimates are\nused in preparing Citi\u2019s\nfinancial statements,\nincluding those related to\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below\nand Notes 1 and 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nChanges to Financial\nAccounting and Reporting\nStandards or Interpretations\nCould Have a Material Impact\non How Citi Records and\nReports Its Financial\nCondition and Results of\nOperations.\n\nPeriodically, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board\n(FASB) issues financial\naccounting and reporting\nstandards that govern key\naspects of Citi\u2019s financial\nstatements or interpretations\nthereof when those standards\nbecome effective, including\nthose areas where Citi is\nrequired to make assumptions\nor estimates. Changes to\nfinancial accounting or\nreporting standards or\ninterpretations, whether\npromulgated or required by the\nFASB or other regulators,\ncould present operational\nchallenges and could also\nrequire Citi to change certain\nof the assumptions or\nestimates it previously used\nin preparing its financial\nstatements, which could\nnegatively impact how it\nrecords and reports its\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations\ngenerally and/or with respect\nto particular businesses. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s accounting policies,\nincluding the expected impacts\non Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition, see Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nIf Citi\u2019s Risk Management\nProcesses, Strategies or\nModels Are Deficient or\nIneffective, Citi May Incur\nSignificant Losses and Its\nRegulatory Capital and Capital\nRatios Could Be Negatively\nImpacted.\n\nCiti utilizes a broad and\ndiversified set of risk\nmanagement and mitigation\nprocesses and strategies,\nincluding the use of risk\nmodels in analyzing and\nmonitoring the various risks\nCiti assumes in conducting its\nactivities. For example, Citi\nuses models as part of its\ncomprehensive stress testing\ninitiatives across the\nCompany. Citi also relies on\ndata to aggregate, assess and\nmanage various risk exposures.\nManagement of these risks is\nmade even more challenging\nwithin a global financial\ninstitution such as Citi,\nparticularly given the\ncomplex, diverse and rapidly\nchanging financial markets and\nconditions in which Citi\noperates as well as that\nlosses can occur from\nuntimely, inaccurate or\nincomplete processes caused by\nunintentional human error.\n\nIn addition, in October 2020,\nCitigroup and Citibank entered\ninto consent orders with the\nFRB and OCC that require\nCitigroup and Citibank to\nsubmit acceptable plans\nrelating principally to making\nimprovements in various\naspects of enterprise-wide\nrisk management, compliance,\ndata quality management and\ngovernance and internal\ncontrols (see \u201cCiti\u2019s Consent\nOrder Compliance\u201d above and\nthe legal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factor\nbelow).\n\nCiti\u2019s risk management\nprocesses, strategies and\nmodels are inherently limited\nbecause they involve\ntechniques, including the use\nof historical data in many\ncircumstances, assumptions and\njudgments that cannot\nanticipate every\n                               57                               \neconomic and financial outcome\nin the markets in which Citi\noperates, nor can they\nanticipate the specifics and\ntiming of such outcomes. Citi\ncould incur significant\nlosses, and its regulatory\ncapital and capital ratios\ncould be negatively impacted,\nif Citi\u2019s risk management\nprocesses, including its\nability to manage and\naggregate data in a timely and\naccurate manner, strategies or\nmodels are deficient or\nineffective. Such deficiencies\nor ineffectiveness could also\nresult in inaccurate\nfinancial, regulatory or risk\nreporting.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s Basel III\nregulatory capital models,\nincluding its credit, market\nand operational risk models,\ncurrently remain subject to\nongoing regulatory review and\napproval, which may result in\nrefinements, modifications or\nenhancements (required or\notherwise) to these models.\nModifications or requirements\nresulting from these ongoing\nreviews, as well as any future\nchanges or guidance provided\nby the U.S. banking agencies\nregarding the regulatory\ncapital framework applicable\nto Citi, have resulted in, and\ncould continue to result in,\nsignificant changes to Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets. These\nchanges can negatively impact\nCiti\u2019s capital ratios and its\nability to achieve its\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\n                                                                \n  CREDIT RISKS                                                  \n                                                                \nCredit Risk and Concentrations\nof Risk Can Increase the\nPotential for Citi to Incur\nSignificant Losses.\n\nCredit risk primarily arises\nfrom Citi\u2019s lending and other\nbusinesses in both GCB and ICG\n. Citi has credit exposures to\nconsumer, corporate and public\nsector borrowers and other\ncounterparties in the U.S. and\nvarious countries and\njurisdictions globally,\nincluding end-of-period\nconsumer loans of $289 billion\nand end-of-period corporate\nloans of $387 billion at year-\nend 2020.\n\nA default by a borrower or\nother counterparty, or a\ndecline in the credit quality\nor value of any underlying\ncollateral, exposes Citi to\ncredit risk. Despite Citi\u2019s\ntarget client strategy,\nvarious pandemic-related,\nmacroeconomic, geopolitical\nand other factors, among other\nthings, can increase Citi\u2019s\ncredit risk and credit costs\n(for additional information,\nsee the pandemic-related, co-\nbranding and private label\ncredit card, macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties\nand emerging markets risk\nfactors above).\n\nWhile Citi provides reserves\nfor expected losses for its\ncredit exposures, as\napplicable, such reserves are\nsubject to judgments and\nestimates that could be\nincorrect or differ from\nactual future events. Under\nthe CECL accounting standard,\nthe ACL reflects expected\nlosses, rather than incurred\nlosses, which has resulted in\nand could lead to additional\nvolatility in the allowance\nand the provision for credit\nlosses as forecasts of\neconomic conditions change. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s future\nallowance may be affected by\nseasonality of its cards\nportfolios based on historical\nevidence showing that (i)\ncredit card balances typically\ndecrease during the first and\nsecond quarters, as borrowers\nuse tax refunds to pay down\nbalances; and (ii) balances\nincrease during the third and\nfourth quarters each year as\npayments are no longer\nimpacted by tax refunds and\nthe holiday season approaches.\nHowever these seasonal trends\ncould be affected in 2021 due\nto the impacts of\n\nthe pandemic, government\nstimulus and expiration of\n\nconsumer and small business\nrelief programs. For\nadditional information, see\nthe incorrect assumptions or\nestimates and changes to\nfinancial accounting and\nreporting standards risk\nfactors above. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below and Notes 1\nand 15 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s credit and country\nrisk, see each respective\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above and \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit Risk\u201d and\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Strategic Risk\u2014Country\nRisk\u201d below and Notes 14 and\n15 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nConcentrations of risk,\nparticularly credit and market\nrisks, can also increase\nCiti\u2019s risk of significant\nlosses. As of year-end 2020,\nCiti\u2019s most significant\nconcentration of credit risk\nwas with the U.S. government\nand its agencies, which\nprimarily results from trading\nassets and investments issued\nby the U.S. government and its\nagencies (for additional\ninformation, including\nconcentrations of credit risk\nto other public sector\nentities, see Note 23 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements). In addition, Citi\nroutinely executes a high\nvolume of securities, trading,\nderivative and foreign\nexchange transactions with\nnon-U.S. sovereigns and with\ncounterparties in the\nfinancial services industry,\nincluding banks, insurance\ncompanies, investment banks,\ngovernments, central banks and\nother financial institutions.\nMoreover, Citi has\nindemnification obligations in\nconnection with various\ntransactions that expose it to\nconcentrations of risk,\nincluding credit risk from\nhedging or reinsurance\narrangements related to those\nobligations (for additional\ninformation about these\nexposures, see Note 26 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements). A rapid\ndeterioration of a large\nborrower or other counterparty\nor within a sector or country\nwhere Citi has large exposures\nor guarantees or unexpected\nmarket dislocations could\ncause Citi to incur\nsignificant losses.\n                                                                \n  LIQUIDITY RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nThe Maintenance of Adequate\nLiquidity and Funding Depends\non Numerous Factors, Including\nThose Outside of Citi\u2019s\nControl, Such as Market\nDisruptions and Increases in\nCiti\u2019s Credit Spreads.\n\nAs a large, global financial\ninstitution, adequate\nliquidity and sources of\nfunding are essential to\nCiti\u2019s businesses. Citi\u2019s\nliquidity and sources of\nfunding can be significantly\nand negatively impacted by\nfactors it cannot control,\nsuch as general disruptions in\nthe financial markets,\ngovernmental fiscal and\nmonetary policies, regulatory\nchanges or negative investor\nperceptions of Citi\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, unexpected\nincreases in cash or\ncollateral requirements and\nthe inability to monetize\navailable liquidity resources,\nwhether due to the pandemic or\notherwise. Citi competes with\nother banks and financial\ninstitutions for deposits,\nwhich represent Citi\u2019s most\nstable and lowest cost source\nof long-term funding. The\ncompetition for retail banking\ndeposits has increased in\nrecent years as a result of\nonline banks and digital\nbanking, among others.\nFurthermore, although Citi\u2019s\nhas had robust deposit growth\nsince the onset of the\npandemic, it remains unclear\nhow \u201csticky\u201d (likely to remain\nat Citi) those deposits may\nbe, particularly in a less\naccommodating environment.\n                               58                               \nMoreover, Citi\u2019s costs to\nobtain and access secured\nfunding and long-term\nunsecured funding are directly\nrelated to its credit spreads.\nChanges in credit spreads are\ndriven by both external market\nfactors and factors specific\nto Citi, and can be highly\nvolatile. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s primary\nsources of funding, see\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to obtain\nfunding may be impaired if\nother market participants are\nseeking to access the markets\nat the same time, or if market\nappetite declines, as is\nlikely to occur in a liquidity\nstress event or other market\ncrisis. A sudden drop in\nmarket liquidity could also\ncause a temporary or lengthier\ndislocation of underwriting\nand capital markets activity.\nIn addition, clearing\norganizations, central banks,\nclients and financial\ninstitutions with which Citi\ninteracts may exercise the\nright to require additional\ncollateral based on their\nperceptions or the market\nconditions, which could\nfurther impair Citi\u2019s access\nto and cost of funding.\n\nAdditionally, as a holding\ncompany, Citi relies on\ninterest, dividends,\ndistributions and other\npayments from its subsidiaries\nto fund dividends as well as\nto satisfy its debt and other\nobligations. Several of Citi\u2019s\nU.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries\nare or may be subject to\ncapital adequacy or other\nregulatory or contractual\nrestrictions on their ability\nto provide such payments,\nincluding any local regulatory\nstress test requirements.\nLimitations on the payments\nthat Citi receives from its\nsubsidiaries could also impact\nits liquidity.\n\nThe Credit Rating Agencies\nContinuously Review the Credit\nRatings of Citi and Certain of\nIts Subsidiaries, and a\nRatings Downgrade Could Have a\nNegative Impact on Citi\u2019s\nFunding and Liquidity Due to\nReduced Funding Capacity and\nIncreased Funding Costs,\nIncluding Derivatives Triggers\nThat Could Require Cash\nObligations or Collateral\nRequirements.\n\nThe credit rating agencies,\nsuch as Fitch, Moody\u2019s and\nS&P, continuously evaluate\nCiti and certain of its\nsubsidiaries. Their ratings of\nCiti and its more significant\nsubsidiaries\u2019 long-term/\nsenior debt and short-\nterm/commercial paper are\nbased on a number of factors,\nincluding standalone financial\nstrength, as well as factors\nthat are not entirely within\nthe control of Citi and its\nsubsidiaries, such as the\nagencies\u2019 proprietary rating\nmethodologies and assumptions,\nand conditions affecting the\nfinancial services industry\nand markets generally.\n\nCiti and its subsidiaries may\nnot be able to maintain their\ncurrent respective ratings. A\nratings downgrade could\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nability to access the capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds as well as the costs of\nthose funds, and its ability\nto maintain certain deposits.\nA ratings downgrade could also\nhave a negative impact on\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\ndue to reduced funding\ncapacity and the impact from\nderivative triggers, which\ncould require Citi to meet\ncash obligations and\ncollateral requirements. In\naddition, a ratings downgrade\ncould have a negative impact\non other funding sources such\nas secured financing and other\nmargined transactions for\nwhich there may be no explicit\ntriggers, and on contractual\nprovisions and other credit\nrequirements of Citi\u2019s\ncounterparties and clients\nthat may contain minimum\nratings thresholds in order\nfor Citi to hold third-party\nfunds. Some entities could\nhave ratings limitations on\ntheir\n\npermissible counterparties, of\nwhich Citi may or may not be\naware.\n\nFurthermore, a credit ratings\ndowngrade could have impacts\nthat may not be currently\nknown to Citi or are not\npossible to quantify. Certain\nof Citi\u2019s corporate customers\nand trading counterparties,\namong other clients, could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit the trading of certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi in\nresponse to ratings\ndowngrades. Changes in\ncustomer and counterparty\nbehavior could impact not only\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nbut also the results of\noperations of certain Citi\nbusinesses. For additional\ninformation on the potential\nimpact of a reduction in\nCiti\u2019s or Citibank\u2019s credit\nratings, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISKS                                              \n                                                                \nOngoing Interpretation and\nImplementation of Regulatory\nand Legislative Requirements\nand Changes in the U.S. and\nGlobally Have Increased Citi\u2019s\nCompliance, Regulatory and\nOther Risks and Costs.\n\nCiti is continually required\nto interpret and implement\nextensive and frequently\nchanging regulatory and\nlegislative requirements in\nthe U.S. and other\njurisdictions where it does\nbusiness, resulting in\nsubstantial compliance,\nregulatory and other risks and\ncosts. In addition, there are\nheightened regulatory scrutiny\nand expectations in the U.S.\nand globally for large\nfinancial institutions, as\nwell as their employees and\nagents, with respect to, among\nother things, governance,\ninfrastructure, data and risk\nmanagement practices and\ncontrols. A failure to comply\nwith these requirements and\nexpectations or resolve any\nidentified deficiencies could\nresult in increased regulatory\noversight and restrictions,\nenforcement proceedings,\npenalties and fines (for\nadditional information, see\nthe legal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factor\nbelow).\n\nOver the past several years,\nCiti has been required to\nimplement a significant number\nof regulatory and legislative\nchanges across all of its\nbusinesses and functions, and\nthese changes continue. The\nchanges themselves may be\ncomplex and subject to\ninterpretation, and will\nrequire continued investments\nin Citi\u2019s global operations\nand technology solutions. In\nsome cases, Citi\u2019s\nimplementation of a regulatory\nor legislative requirement is\noccurring simultaneously with\nchanging or conflicting\nregulatory guidance, legal\nchallenges or legislative\naction to modify or repeal\nexisting rules or enact new\nrules. Moreover, in some\ncases, there have been\nentirely new regulatory or\nlegislative requirements or\nregimes, resulting in large\nvolumes of regulation and\npotential uncertainty\nregarding regulatory\nexpectations as to what is\nrequired in order to be in\ncompliance.\n\nExamples of regulatory or\nlegislative changes that have\nresulted in increased\ncompliance risks and costs\ninclude (i) a proliferation of\nlaws relating to the\nlimitation of cross-border\ndata movement and/or\ncollection and use of customer\ninformation, including data\nlocalization and protection\nand privacy laws, which also\ncan conflict with or increase\ncompliance complexity with\nrespect to other laws,\nincluding anti-money\nlaundering laws; and (ii) the\nFRB\u2019s \u201ctotal loss absorbing\ncapacity\u201d (TLAC) requirements.\nAdditionally, the banking\nindustry generally is being\ncalled upon to do more on the\nissues of social, economic and\nracial justice. This could\n                               59                               \nresult in additional\nregulatory requirements\nregarding banking services for\nunderserved communities and\nindividuals.\n\nIncreased and ongoing\ncompliance requirements and\nuncertainties have resulted in\nhigher compliance costs for\nCiti, in part due to an\nincrease in risk, regulatory\nand compliance staff over the\nlast several years despite a\nreduction in the overall\nemployee population. Extensive\nand changing compliance\nrequirements can also result\nin increased reputational and\nlegal risks for Citi, as\nfailure to comply with\nregulations and requirements,\nor failure to comply with\nregulatory expectations, can\nresult in enforcement and/or\nregulatory proceedings,\npenalties and fines.\n\nCiti Is Subject to Extensive\nLegal and Regulatory\nProceedings, Examinations,\nInvestigations, Consent Orders\nand Related Compliance Efforts\nand Other Inquiries That Could\nResult in Significant Monetary\nPenalties, Supervisory or\nEnforcement Orders, Business\nRestrictions, Limitations on\nDividends, Changes to\nDirectors and/or Officers and\nCollateral Consequences\nArising from Such Outcomes.\n\nAt any given time, Citi is a\nparty to a significant number\nof legal and regulatory\nproceedings and is subject to\nnumerous governmental and\nregulatory examinations,\ninvestigations, consent orders\nand related compliance\nefforts, and other inquiries.\nCiti can also be subject to\nenforcement proceedings not\nonly because of violations of\nlaws and regulations, but also\ndue to failures, as determined\nby its regulators, to have\nadequate policies and\nprocedures, or to remedy\ndeficiencies on a timely\nbasis.\n\nThe recent FRB and OCC consent\norders require Citigroup and\nCitibank to submit acceptable\nplans to the FRB and OCC, on\nvarious timelines, relating\nprincipally to making\nimprovements in various\naspects of enterprise-wide\nrisk management, compliance,\ndata quality management and\ngovernance and internal\ncontrols. The consent orders\nrequire preparation of\nacceptable gap analyses that\nidentify the required\nimprovements and related root\ncauses, as well as targeted\naction plans and quarterly\nprogress reports detailing the\nresults and status of the\nimprovements. These\nimprovements will result in\nsignificant investments by\nCiti during 2021 and\nafterwards, as an essential\npart of Citi\u2019s broader\ntransformation efforts to\nenhance its infrastructure,\ngovernance, processes and risk\nand controls. Although there\nare no restrictions on Citi\u2019s\nability to serve its clients,\nthe Citibank consent order\nrequires prior approval of any\nsignificant new acquisition,\nincluding any portfolio or\nbusiness acquisition,\nexcluding ordinary course\ntransactions. Moreover, the\nCitibank consent order\nprovides that the OCC has the\nright to assess future civil\nmonetary penalties or take\nother supervisory and/or\nenforcement actions, including\nwhere the OCC determines\nCitibank has not made\nsufficient and sustainable\nprogress to address the\nrequired improvements. Such\nactions by the OCC could\ninclude imposing business\nrestrictions, including\npossible limitations on the\ndeclaration or payment of\ndividends and changes in\ndirectors and/or senior\nexecutive officers. More\ngenerally the OCC and/or the\nFederal Reserve could take\nadditional enforcement or\nother actions if the\nregulatory agency believes\nthat Citi has not met\nregulatory expectations\nregarding compliance with the\nconsent orders.\n\nFor additional information\nregarding the consent orders,\nsee \u201cCiti\u2019s Consent Order\nCompliance\u201d above.\n\nThe global judicial,\nregulatory and political\nenvironment has generally been\nchallenging for large\nfinancial institutions. The\ncomplexity of the federal and\nstate regulatory and\nenforcement regimes in the\nU.S., coupled with the global\nscope of Citi\u2019s operations,\nalso means that a single event\nor issue may give rise to a\nlarge number of overlapping\ninvestigations and regulatory\nproceedings, either by\nmultiple federal and state\nagencies and authorities in\nthe U.S. or by multiple\nregulators and other\ngovernmental entities in\ndifferent jurisdictions, as\nwell as multiple civil\nlitigation claims in multiple\njurisdictions.\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators\nhave been increasingly focused\non \u201cconduct risk,\u201d a term used\nto describe the risks\nassociated with behavior by\nemployees and agents,\nincluding third parties, that\ncould harm clients, customers,\nemployees or the integrity of\nthe markets, such as\nimproperly creating, selling,\nmarketing or managing products\nand services or improper\nincentive compensation\nprograms with respect thereto,\nfailures to safeguard a\nparty\u2019s personal information,\nor failures to identify and\nmanage conflicts of interest.\nIn addition to the greater\nfocus on conduct risk, the\ngeneral heightened scrutiny\nand expectations from\nregulators could lead to\ninvestigations and other\ninquiries, as well as\nremediation requirements, more\nregulatory or other\nenforcement proceedings, civil\nlitigation and higher\ncompliance and other risks and\ncosts.\n\nFurther, while Citi takes\nnumerous steps to prevent and\ndetect conduct by employees\nand agents that could\npotentially harm clients,\ncustomers, employees or the\nintegrity of the markets, such\nbehavior may not always be\ndeterred or prevented. Banking\nregulators have also focused\non the overall culture of\nfinancial services firms,\nincluding Citi.\n\nIn addition to regulatory\nrestrictions or structural\nchanges that could result from\nperceived deficiencies in\nCiti\u2019s culture, such focus\ncould also lead to additional\nregulatory proceedings.\nFurthermore, the severity of\nthe remedies sought in legal\nand regulatory proceedings to\nwhich Citi is subject has\nremained elevated. U.S. and\ncertain international\ngovernmental entities have\nincreasingly brought criminal\nactions against, or have\nsought criminal convictions\nfrom, financial institutions\nand individual employees, and\ncriminal prosecutors in the\nU.S. have increasingly sought\nand obtained criminal guilty\npleas or deferred prosecution\nagreements against corporate\nentities and individuals and\nother criminal sanctions for\nthose institutions and\nindividuals. These types of\nactions by U.S. and\ninternational governmental\nentities may, in the future,\nhave significant collateral\nconsequences for a financial\ninstitution, including loss of\ncustomers and business, and\nthe inability to offer certain\nproducts or services and/or\noperate certain businesses.\nCiti may be required to accept\nor be subject to similar types\nof criminal remedies, consent\norders, sanctions, substantial\nfines and penalties,\nremediation and other\nfinancial costs or other\nrequirements in the future,\nincluding for matters or\npractices not yet known to\nCiti, any of which could\nmaterially and negatively\naffect Citi\u2019s businesses,\nbusiness practices, financial\ncondition or results of\noperations, require material\nchanges in Citi\u2019s operations\nor cause Citi reputational\nharm.\n                               60                               \nFurther, many large\nclaims\u2014both private civil and\nregulatory\u2014asserted against\nCiti are highly complex, slow\nto develop and may involve\nnovel or untested legal\ntheories. The outcome of such\nproceedings is difficult to\npredict or estimate until late\nin the proceedings. Although\nCiti establishes accruals for\nits legal and regulatory\nmatters according to\naccounting requirements,\nCiti\u2019s estimates of, and\nchanges to, these accruals\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty, and\nthe amount of loss ultimately\nincurred in relation to those\nmatters may be substantially\nhigher than the amounts\naccrued. In addition, certain\nsettlements are subject to\ncourt approval and may not be\napproved.\n\nFor additional information\nrelating to Citi\u2019s legal and\nregulatory proceedings and\nmatters, including Citi\u2019s\npolicies on establishing legal\naccruals, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                               61                               \n                                                                \n  HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT                        \n                                                                \nAttracting and retaining a\nhighly qualified and motivated\nworkforce is a strategic\npriority for Citi.

In\nfurtherance of that goal, Citi\nhas focused on measuring and\naddressing pay equity within\nthe organization:\n\n\u2022 In 2018, Citi was the first\nmajor U.S. financial\ninstitution to publicly\nrelease the results of a pay\nequity review comparing\ncompensation of women to men\nand U.S.\n\nminorities to U.S. non-\nminorities. Since then, Citi\nhas continued to be\ntransparent about pay equity,\nalso\n\ndisclosing its unadjusted or\n\u201craw\u201d pay gap for both women\nand U.S. minorities since\n2019.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s 2020 results found\nthat, on an adjusted basis,\nwomen globally are paid on\naverage more than 99% of what\nmen are paid at Citi, and\nthere was no statistically\nsignificant difference in\nadjusted compensation for U.S.\nminorities and non-minorities.\nFollowing the review,\nappropriate pay adjustments\nwere made as part of Citi\u2019s\n2020 compensation cycle.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s 2020 raw gap analysis\nshowed that the median pay for\nwomen globally is better than\n74% of the median for men, up\nfrom 73% in 2019 and 71% in\n2018, and that the median pay\nfor U.S. minorities is just\nunder 94% of the median for\nnon-minorities, which is\nsimilar to 2019 and up from\n93% in 2018.\n\n\u2022 To continue closing the pay\ngap, Citi has set goals to\nincrease representation at the\nassistant vice president\nthrough managing director\nlevels to at least 40% for\nwomen globally and 8% for\nBlack colleagues in the U.S.\nby the end of 2021.\n\nCiti also has a goal to:\n\n\u2022 expand the use of diverse\nslates across the firm in 2021\nto include not one, but at\nleast two women or\nracial/ethnic minorities in\nCiti\u2019s interviews for U.S.\nhires and at least two women\nin interviews for global\nhires; and\n                               62                               \n\u2022 increase the analyst and\nassociate programs to 50%\nfemale colleagues globally and\n30% Black and Hispanic/Latino\ncolleagues in the U.S.\n\nIn 2020, Citi also:\n\n\u2022 expanded the standard for a\ndiverse slate to include at\nleast one woman globally and\none woman and/or U.S. minority\nfor U.S. hires at the\nassistant vice president, vice\npresident and senior vice\npresident levels, in addition\nto managing director and\ndirector level hires;\n\n\u2022 included a diverse slate of\ncandidates, with at least one\nwoman and/or U.S. minority,\nfor 86% of roles that were\nposted globally with a\nqualified slate;\n\n\u2022 increased representation of\nunderrepresented minorities in\nits full-time U.S. campus\nrecruitment program from 18%\nin 2019 to 26% in 2020;\n\n\u2022 increased female\nrepresentation in its full-\ntime U.S. campus recruitment\nprogram from 45% in 2019 to\n46% in 2020; and\n\n\u2022 increased female\nrepresentation in its summer\ninternship program from 47% in\n2019 to 52% in 2020 in the\nU.S. and from 48% in 2019 to\n50% in 2020 globally, while\nBlack and Hispanic/Latino\nrepresentation in its summer\nclass increased from 26% to\n27% over the same timeframe.\nThis was Citi\u2019s most diverse\nintern class to date.\n                                                                \n  Workforce Development                                         \n                                                                \nCiti highly values a workplace\nenvironment where its\ncolleagues can bring their\nwhole selves to work and where\ndiverse perspectives and ideas\nare embraced. Citi encourages\ncareer growth and development\nby offering broad and diverse\nopportunities to colleagues.\nHighlights of these\nopportunities include the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Citi provides a range of\ninternal development and\nrotational programs to\ncolleagues at all levels,\nincluding various training\nprograms and events to assist\nhigh-performing colleagues in\nbuilding the skills needed to\ntransition to manager and\nsupervisory roles.\n\n\u2022 Citi has a focus on internal\ntalent development and aims to\nprovide colleagues with career\ngrowth opportunities, with 33%\nof open positions filled\ninternally. This emphasis is\nparticularly important as Citi\nfocuses on providing career\npaths for its diverse talent\nbase as part of its efforts to\nincrease diverse\nrepresentation at more senior\nlevels of the organization.\n\n\u2022 In order to assist\ncolleagues in a rapidly\nchanging world, Citi offers an\nonline platform that delivers\ninformation on various topics\nof interest to colleagues,\nsuch as leadership, data\nanalytics, artificial\nintelligence and\ncybersecurity, among others.\n\nFor information about Citi\u2019s\nreliance on a highly qualified\nand motivated workforce, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d above.

                                                   \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nFor Citi, effective risk\nmanagement is of primary\nimportance to its overall\noperations. Accordingly,\nCiti\u2019s risk management process\nhas been designed to monitor,\nevaluate and manage the\nprincipal risks it assumes in\nconducting its activities.\nSpecifically, the activities\nthat Citi engages in, and the\nrisks those activities\ngenerate, must be consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s mission and value\nproposition, the key\nprinciples that guide it and\nCiti's risk appetite. As\ndiscussed above, Citi is\ncontinuing its efforts to\ncomply with the Federal\nReserve Board and OCC consent\norders, relating principally\nto various aspects of risk\nmanagement, compliance, data\nquality management and\ngovernance, and internal\ncontrols, see \u201cCiti\u2019s Consent\nOrder Compliance\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d\nabove.\n\nRisk management must be built\non a foundation of ethical\nculture. Under Citi\u2019s mission\nand value proposition, which\nwas developed by its senior\nleadership and distributed\nthroughout the Company, Citi\nstrives to serve its clients\nas a trusted partner by\nresponsibly providing\nfinancial services that enable\ngrowth and economic progress\nwhile earning and maintaining\nthe public\u2019s trust by\nconstantly adhering to the\nhighest ethical standards. As\nsuch, Citi asks all colleagues\nto ensure that their decisions\npass three tests: they are in\nCiti\u2019s clients\u2019 interests,\ncreate economic value and are\nalways systemically\nresponsible. In addition, Citi\nevaluates colleagues\u2019\nperformance against behavioral\nexpectations set out in Citi\u2019s\nleadership standards, which\nwere designed in part to\neffectuate Citi\u2019s mission and\nvalue proposition. Other\nculture-related efforts in\nconnection with conduct risk,\nethics and leadership,\nescalation and treating\ncustomers fairly help Citi to\nexecute its mission and value\nproposition.\n\nCiti\u2019s Company-wide risk\ngovernance framework consists\nof the risk management\npractices that include a risk\ngovernance structure and the\nfirm\u2019s key policies,\nprocesses, personnel and\ncontrol systems through which\nCiti identifies, measures,\nmonitors, and controls risks\nsuch that the Company\u2019s risk\ntaking is consistent with its\nstrategy and risk appetite. It\nalso emphasizes Citi\u2019s risk\nculture and lays out\nstandards, procedures and\nprograms that are designed to\nset, reinforce and enhance the\nCompany\u2019s risk culture,\nintegrate its values and\nconduct expectations into the\norganization, providing\ncolleagues with tools to\nassist them with making\nprudent and ethical risk\ndecisions and to escalate\nissues appropriately.\n\nCiti selectively takes risks\nin support of its underlying\ncustomer-centric strategy.\nCiti\u2019s objective is to ensure\nthat those risks are\nconsistent with its mission\nand value proposition,\nincluding its commitment to\nresponsible finance. Citi\u2019s\nrisk mission is taking\nintelligent risk with shared\nresponsibility, without\nforsaking individual\naccountability.\n\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite framework\nsets boundaries for risk\ntaking and consists of a set\nof risk appetite statements\nthat articulate the aggregate\nlevel and types of risk that\nCiti is willing to accept in\norder to achieve its strategic\nobjectives and business plan\nand includes governance\nprocesses through which the\nrisk appetite is established,\ncommunicated and monitored,\nand its breaches are escalated\nand resolved. It is built on\nquantitative boundaries, which\ninclude goals, risk\n\nlimits and thresholds, and on\nqualitative principles that\nguide behavior. Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite framework is\nenterprise-wide and applicable\nacross products, functions and\ngeographies and\ncomprehensively covers the\nmajor categories of risk\nfacing the firm.\n\nCiti\u2019s risks are generally\ncategorized and summarized as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Credit risk is the risk of\nloss resulting from the\ndecline in credit quality (or\ndowngrade risk) or failure of\na borrower, counterparty,\nthird party or issuer to honor\nits financial or contractual\nobligations.\n\n\u2022 Liquidity risk is the risk\nthat the firm will not be able\nto efficiently meet both\nexpected and unexpected\ncurrent and future cash flow\nand collateral needs without\nadversely affecting either\ndaily operations or financial\nconditions of the firm. This\nrisk may be exacerbated by the\ninability of the firm to\naccess funding sources or\nmonetize assets and the\ncomposition of liability\nfunding and liquid assets.\n\n\u2022 Market risk (including price\nrisk and interest rate risk)\nis the risk of loss arising\nfrom changes in the value of\nCiti\u2019s assets and liabilities\nor reduced net interest\nrevenues resulting from\nchanges in market variables,\nsuch as interest rates,\nexchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices or credit\nspreads. Losses can be\nexacerbated by the negative\nconvexity of positions, as\nwell as the presence of basis\nor correlation risks.\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems,\nor from external events. It\nincludes legal risk, which is\nthe risk of loss (including\nlitigation costs, settlements\nand regulatory fines)\nresulting from the failure of\nthe firm to comply with laws,\nregulations, prudent ethical\nstandards and contractual\nobligations in any aspect of\nthe firm\u2019s business, but\nexcludes strategic and\nreputation risks (see below).\n\n\u2022 Compliance risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial conditions and\nresilience arising from\nviolations of laws, rules or\nregulations, or from non-\nconformance with prescribed\npractices, internal policies\nand procedures or ethical\nstandards. It also includes\nthe exposure to litigation\n(known as legal risk) from all\naspects of banking,\ntraditional and non-\ntraditional.\n\n\u2022 Reputation risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial conditions and\nresilience arising from\nnegative public opinion. This\nrisk may impair Citi\u2019s\ncompetitiveness by affecting\nits ability to establish new\nrelationships or services or\ncontinue servicing existing\nrelationships.\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk\nto current or anticipated\nearnings, capital, or\nfranchise or enterprise value\narising from poor, but\nauthorized, business decisions\n(in compliance with\nregulations, policies and\nprocedures), an inability to\nadapt to changes in the\noperating environment, or\nother external factors that\nmay impair the ability to\ncarry out a business strategy.\nStrategic risk also includes:\n\n\u25e6 Country risk , which is the\nrisk that conditions in a\ncountry (which may be\nprecipitated by developments\nwithin or external to a\ncountry) will impair the value\nof Citi\u2019s franchise or will\nadversely affect the ability\nof obligors within that\ncountry to honor their\n                               66                               \nobligations to Citi. Country\nrisk includes sovereign\ndefaults, banking crises,\ncurrency crises, currency\nconvertibility and/or\ntransferability restrictions\nor political developments.\n\nCiti uses a lines of defense\nconstruct to manage its risks.\nThe construct comprises units\nthat create risks (first line\nof defense), those that\nindependently assess risk\n(second line of defense),\nunits that provide independent\nassurance (third line of\ndefense) and units tasked with\nmaintaining a strong control\nenvironment (control and\nsupport functions). The lines\nof defense, which include\ncontrol and support functions,\ncoordinate with each other in\nthe risk management system in\nsupport of the common goal of\nidentifying, measuring,\nmonitoring and controlling\nrisk-taking activities so they\nremain consistent with the\nfirm\u2019s strategy and risk\nappetite.\n\nFirst Line of Defense: Front\nLine Units and Front Line Unit\nActivities\n\nCiti\u2019s first line of defense\nowns the risks inherent in or\narising from their business\nand is responsible for\nidentifying, assessing and\ncontrolling those risks so\nthat they are within Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite.\n\nFront line units are\nresponsible and held\naccountable for managing the\nrisks associated with their\nactivities within the\nboundaries set by independent\nrisk management. They are also\nresponsible for designing and\nimplementing effective\ninternal controls and\nmaintaining processes for\nmanaging their risk profile,\nincluding through risk\nmitigation, so that it remains\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\nestablished risk appetite.\n\nFront line unit activities are\nconsidered part of the first\nline of defense and are\nsubject to the oversight and\nchallenge of independent risk\nmanagement, whether they are\nconducted by a front line unit\nor another line of defense\ndesignation. Note that front\nline units may also conduct\ncontrol and support activities\nwhich are subject to the\nrelevant firm-wide independent\noversight processes specific\nto the risk category that they\ngenerate (e.g., operational\nrisk, compliance risk,\nreputation risk).\n\nThe first line of defense is\ncomposed of Citi\u2019s Business\nManagement ( Global Consumer\nBank ( GCB ) and Institutional\nClients Group ( ICG )),\nRegional and Country\nManagement, certain Corporate\nFunctions (Enterprise\nInfrastructure, Operations and\nTechnology (EIO&T) and\nFinance), as well as other\nfront line unit activities.\n\nSecond Line of Defense:\nIndependent risk management\n\nIndependent risk management\nunits are independent of front\nline units. They are\nresponsible for overseeing the\nrisk-taking activities of the\nfirst line of defense and\nchallenging the first line of\ndefense in the execution of\ntheir risk management\nresponsibilities. They are\nalso responsible for\nindependently identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring and\ncontrolling aggregate risks\nand for setting standards for\nthe management and oversight\nof risk. At Citi, the second\nline of defense is defined to\ninclude Independent Risk\nManagement and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management\n(ICRM). Independent Risk\nManagement and ICRM report to\nCiti\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and\nChief Compliance Officer\n(CCO), respectively, both of\nwhom report directly to the\nCitigroup CEO and have\n\nunrestricted access to the\nCitigroup Board of Directors\nor its committees.\n                                                                \n  Independent Risk Management                                   \n                                                                \nThe Independent Risk\nManagement organization sets\nrisk and control standards for\nthe first line of defense and\nactively manages and oversees\naggregate credit, market\n(price and interest rate),\nliquidity, strategic,\noperational, compliance and\nreputation risks across the\nfirm, including risks that\nspan categories, such as\nconcentration risk.\n\nIndependent Risk Management is\norganized to align to\nbusinesses, regions, types of\nrisk and to firm-wide, cross-\nrisk functions or processes.\nThere are teams that report to\nan independent Chief Risk\nOfficer (CRO) for Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses (Business CROs,\nincluding Finance Chief Risk\nOfficers) and regions / legal\nentities (Regional / Legal\nEntity CROs). In addition,\nthere are risk-category-\naligned teams that report to a\nRisk Category Head (e.g.,\nMarket Risk, Operational Risk,\nModel Risk) and foundational\nteams that report to a\nFoundational Risk Management\nHead (e.g., Risk Governance,\nEnterprise Concentration Risk\nManagement, Global Risk\nReview). All of the above Risk\nHeads, together with the\nBusiness and Regional / Legal\nEntity CROs, report to the\nCitigroup CRO.\n                                                                \n  Independent Compliance Risk Management                        \n                                                                \nThe Independent Compliance\nRisk Management organization\nis designed to oversee and\nchallenge products, functions,\njurisdictional activities and\nlegal entities in managing\ncompliance risk, as well as\npromoting business conduct and\nactivity that is consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s mission and value\nproposition and the compliance\nrisk appetite. Citi\u2019s\nobjective is to embed an\nenterprise-wide compliance\nrisk management framework and\nculture that identifies,\nmeasures, monitors, controls\nand escalates compliance risk\nacross the firm.\n\nProduct Line, Function and\nCountry ICRM provide\ncompliance risk management\nadvice and credible challenge\non day-to-day matters and\nstrategic decision-making for\nkey initiatives. Additionally,\nCountry ICRM provides advisory\nand challenge on regulatory\nand enterprise wide matters\nsuch as regulatory changes in\na country. ICRM has program-\nlevel Enterprise Compliance\nunits whose Heads are\nresponsible for coordinating\nand managing their respective\nhorizontal, enterprise-wide\ncompliance programs, setting\nstandards and establishing\npriorities for program-related\ncompliance efforts.\n                                                                \n  Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit                         \n                                                                \nInternal audit is independent\nof front line units and\nindependent risk management\nunits. Internal audit provides\nindependent assurance to the\nCitigroup Board of Directors\non the effectiveness of\ngovernance, risk management\nand internal controls.\nInternal audit reports to a\nchief audit executive (i.e.,\nCiti\u2019s Chief Auditor) who has\nunrestricted access to the\nBoard or its audit committee\nto facilitate the ability to\nexecute specific\nresponsibilities pertaining to\nescalation of risks and\nissues.\n\nThe Internal Audit function\nhas designated Chief Auditors\nresponsible for assessing the\ndesign and effectiveness of\ncontrols within the various\nbusiness units, functions,\ngeographies and legal entities\nin which Citi operates.\n                               67                               \nThe Citigroup Chief Auditor\nmanages Internal Audit and\nmaintains its independence\nfrom the front line units,\nIndependent Risk Management,\nICRM and control and support\nfunctions by reporting\nfunctionally to the Chairman\nof the Citigroup Audit\nCommittee and administratively\nto the Citigroup CEO.\n                                                                \n  Control and Support Functions                                 \n                                                                \nControl and support functions\ndo not meet the definition of\nfront line unit, independent\nrisk management or internal\naudit. While they do not\nreport into the CRO or CCO,\nthey are expected to design,\nimplement and maintain an\neffective control environment\nwith respect to the risks they\ngenerate, and also support\nsafety and soundness.\n\nAt Citi, the control and\nsupport functions are defined\nto include the following\norganizational units: Chief\nAdministrative Office, Global\nPublic Affairs, Human\nResources, International\nFranchise Management, Legal\n(including Citi Security &\nInvestigative Services) and\nthe Office of the CBNA CEO.\n                                                                \n  Board and Executive Management                                \n                                                                \nThe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors, both directly or\nthrough its committees,\nactively oversees Citi\u2019s risk\ntaking activities and holds\nmanagement accountable for\nadhering to the risk\ngovernance framework. The\nprimary responsibility of the\nCitigroup Board is to provide\neffective governance over\nCiti\u2019s affairs for the benefit\nof its stakeholders. Directors\nhave full and free access to\nmanagement.\n\nThe standing committees of the\nCitigroup Board are the Risk\nManagement Committee, Audit\nCommittee, Personnel and\nCompensation Committee,\nEthics, Conduct and Culture\nCommittee and Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs\nCommittee.\n\nThe Board delegates authority\nto the Executive Management\nTeam, which consists of the\nCitigroup CEO and\n\ncertain direct reports of the\nCEO, for directing and\noverseeing day-to-day\nmanagement of the firm. The\nExecutive Management Team is\nresponsible for developing and\nimplementing policies,\nprocedures and processes that\ntranslate the Board\u2019s goals,\nstrategic objectives and risk\nappetite and limits into\nprudent standards for the safe\nand sound operation of the\nfirm.\n\nThe Executive Management Team\nreports to the Board on the\nfirm\u2019s overall risk profile,\nincluding aggregate and\nemerging risks, and provides\nthe Board with information\nabout current and potential\nrisk exposures and their\npotential impact on earnings,\ncapital and strategic\nobjectives.\n\nExecutive Management\ncommittees have been designed\nto cover all primary risks to\nwhich Citi is exposed. These\nExecutive Management\ncommittees escalate to\nstanding committees of the\nBoard. The standing Executive\nManagement committees are the\nGroup Risk Management\nCommittee, Group Strategic\nRisk Committee, Citigroup\nAsset & Liability Committee,\nGroup Business, Risk and\nControl Committee and Group\nReputation Risk Committee.\n                                                                \n  CREDIT RISK                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nCredit risk is the risk of\nloss resulting from the\ndecline in credit quality of a\nclient, customer or\ncounterparty (or downgrade\nrisk) or the failure of a\nborrower, counterparty, third\nparty or issuer to honor its\nfinancial or contractual\nobligations. Credit risk\narises in many of Citigroup\u2019s\nbusiness activities,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 consumer, commercial and\ncorporate lending;\n\n\u2022 capital markets derivative\ntransactions;\n\n\u2022 structured finance; and\n\n\u2022 securities financing\ntransactions (repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nand securities loaned and\nborrowed).\n\nCredit risk also arises from\nclearing and settlement\nactivities, when Citi\ntransfers an asset in advance\nof receiving its counter-value\nor advances funds to settle a\ntransaction on behalf of a\nclient. Concentration risk,\nwithin credit risk, is the\nrisk associated with having\ncredit exposure concentrated\nwithin a specific client,\nindustry, region or other\ncategory.\n\nCredit risk is one of the most\nsignificant risks Citi faces\nas an institution. For\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Credit Risk\u201d\nabove. As a result, Citi has a\nwell-established framework in\nplace for managing credit risk\nacross all businesses. This\nincludes a defined risk\nappetite, credit limits and\ncredit policies, both at the\nbusiness level as well as at\nthe Company-wide level. Citi\u2019s\ncredit risk management also\nincludes processes and\npolicies with respect to\nproblem recognition, including\n\u201cwatch lists,\u201d portfolio\nreviews, stress tests, updated\nrisk ratings and\nclassification triggers.\n\nWith respect to Citi\u2019s\nclearing and settlement\nactivities, intraday client\nusage of clearing lines is\nmonitored against limits, as\nwell as against usage patterns\nwith settlement activity\nmonitored daily and intraday\nfor select products. To the\nextent that a problem\ndevelops, Citi typically moves\nthe client to a secured\n(collateralized) operating\nmodel. Generally, Citi\u2019s\nintraday clearing and\nsettlement lines are\nuncommitted and cancelable at\nany time.\n\nTo manage concentration of\nrisk within credit risk, Citi\nhas in place a framework\nconsisting of industry limits,\nan idiosyncratic framework\nconsisting of single name\nconcentrations for each\nbusiness and across Citigroup\nand a specialized framework\nconsisting of product limits.\n\nCredit exposures are generally\nreported in notional terms for\naccrual loans, reflecting the\nvalue at which the loans as\nwell as other off-balance\nsheet commitments are carried\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit exposure arising\nfrom capital markets\nactivities is generally\nexpressed as the current mark-\nto-market, net of margin,\nreflecting the net value owed\nto Citi by a given\ncounterparty.\n\nThe credit risk associated\nwith these credit exposures is\na function of the\nidiosyncratic creditworthiness\nof the obligor, as well as the\nterms and conditions of the\nspecific obligation. Citi\nassesses the credit risk\nassociated with its credit\nexposures on a regular basis\nthrough its ACL process (see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d below and Notes 1 and\n15 to the\n                               68                               \nConsolidated Financial\nStatements), as well as\nthrough regular stress testing\nat the company, business,\ngeography and product levels.\nThese stress-testing processes\ntypically estimate potential\nincremental credit costs that\nwould occur as a result of\neither downgrades in the\ncredit quality or defaults of\nthe obligors or\ncounterparties.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s credit risk management,\nsee Note 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                                \n  CONSUMER CREDIT                                               \n                                                                \nCiti provides traditional\nretail banking, including\nsmall business banking, and\ncredit card products in 19\ncountries and jurisdictions\nthrough North America GCB ,\nLatin America GCB and Asia GCB\n.

(NCL)\nrates across both retail\nbanking and cards for total\nGCB and by region.\n                           \n  Global Consumer Banking  \n                           \nAs shown in the chart above,\nGCB \u2019s net credit loss rates\ndecreased significantly year-\nover-year and quarter-over-\nquarter as of the fourth\nquarter of 2020, primarily due\nto the impacts of the consumer\nrelief programs Citi\nimplemented since the\nbeginning of the pandemic,\ncombined with the benefit of\nreduced customer spending and\nsignificant government\nstimulus and assistance, as\nwell as other banks\u2019 consumer\nrelief programs. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate\nincreased quarter-over-\nquarter, largely due to the\nexpiration of the pandemic\nrelief programs in certain\ncountries. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate was\nlargely unchanged year-over-\nyear. As discussed above,\nloans modified under Citi\u2019s\nconsumer relief programs\ncontinue to be reported in the\nsame delinquency bucket they\nwere in at the time of\nmodification and, thus, would\nnot be reported as 90+ days\npast due or written off for\nthe duration of the programs\n(which have various durations,\nand certain of which may be\nrenewed by the customer). As a\nresult of the significant and\nsteady decline in program\nenrollment, Citi ended its\nconsumer relief programs as of\nDecember 31, 2020 for the\nmajority of countries and\nproducts. Citi expects to\nexperience higher consumer net\ncredit loss and 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rates across\nregions, with sharper losses\nin Latin America GCB and Asia\nGCB starting in the near term.\nThe losses will likely vary by\nbusiness and region and be\ndependent on evolving\nmacroeconomic and market\nconditions. These conditions\ninclude the severity and\nduration of the impact from\nthe pandemic and the impacts\nof government stimulus\nprograms, as well as the\ntiming of expiration of\nconsumer relief programs and\nwhen loans move into later\ndelinquency buckets. Citi\nbelieves that these losses are\nadequately reserved for under\nthe CECL standard at December\n31, 2020.

The retail bank is\nconcentrated in six major\nmetropolitan cities in the\nU.S. (for additional\ninformation on the U.S. retail\nbank, see \u201c North America GCB\n\u201d above). As of December 31,\n2020, approximately 71% of\nNorth America GCB consumer\nloans consisted of Citi-\nbranded and Citi retail\nservices cards, which\ngenerally drives the overall\ncredit performance of North\nAmerica GCB (for additional\ninformation on North America\nGCB \u2019s cards portfolios,\nincluding delinquency and net\ncredit loss rates, see \u201cCredit\nCard Trends\u201d below). As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in North\nAmerica GCB decreased\nsignificantly quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year as\nof the fourth quarter of 2020,\ndriven by the impacts of the\nconsumer relief programs\ndescribed above, unemployment\nbenefits and government\nstimulus. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate increased\nquarter-over-quarter,\nprimarily due to seasonality\nin cards and the impact of\ncustomers rolling off the\nconsumer relief programs. The\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate modestly decreased year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nthe impacts of the consumer\nrelief programs described\nabove, unemployment benefits\nand government stimulus.\n                     \n  Latin America GCB  \n                     \nLatin America GCB operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex,\none of Mexico\u2019s largest banks,\nand provides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nLatin America GCB serves a\nmore mass-market segment in\nMexico and focuses on\ndeveloping multiproduct\nrelationships with customers.\n                               70                               \nAs shown in the chart above,\nthe net credit loss rate in\nLatin America GCB decreased\nsignificantly quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year as\nof the fourth quarter of 2020,\nlargely driven by the impact\nof the consumer relief\nprograms described above. The\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate increased significantly\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, due to the adverse\npandemic-related macroeconomic\nimpacts, as well as the\nexpiration of most consumer\nrelief programs in Mexico by\nSeptember 2020.\n              \n  Asia(1)GCB  \n              \n(1) Asia includes GCB\nactivities in certain EMEA\ncountries for all periods\npresented.

The\nperformance of Asia GCB \u2019s\nportfolios, with a 1.16% net\ncredit loss rate, continues to\nreflect the strong credit\nprofiles in the region\u2019s\ntarget customer segments.\nRegulatory changes in many\nmarkets in Asia over the past\nfew years have also resulted\nin improved credit quality.\nFor additional information on\ncost of credit, loan\ndelinquency and other\ninformation for Citi\u2019s\nconsumer loan portfolios, see\neach respective business\u2019s\nresults of operations above\nand Notes 14 and 15 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nCredit Card Trends The\nfollowing charts show the\nquarterly trends in\ndelinquencies and net credit\nlosses for total GCB cards,\nNorth America Citi-branded\ncards and Citi retail services\nportfolios, as well as for\nCiti\u2019s Latin America and Asia\nCiti-branded cards portfolios.\n                \n  Global Cards  \n                \n                                    \n  North America Citi-Branded Cards  \n                                    \nNorth America GCB \u2019s Citi-\nbranded cards portfolio issues\nproprietary and co-branded\ncards.

Risk\nratings and classifications\nare reviewed regularly, and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. This includes but\nis not limited to exposures in\nthose sectors significantly\nimpacted by the pandemic\n(including energy and energy-\nrelated, consumer retail,\ncommercial real estate and\ntransportation). Citigroup\nbelieves the corporate credit\nportfolio to be appropriately\nrated and classified as of\nDecember 31, 2020. During the\nyear and since the onset of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic,\nCitigroup has taken action to\nadjust internal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, downgrades may\nresult in the purchase of\nadditional credit derivatives\nor other risk mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure the\nappropriate probability of\ndefault is incorporated into\nall risk assessments.

       \n(1) On January 1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(CECL) . The ASC introduces a new credit loss methodology\nrequiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also\nproviding additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1,\n2020, Citi recorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%,\npretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses, along with a\n$3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a\ndeferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the Consumer ACL due\nto longer estimated tenors than under the incurred loss\nmethodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a\n$0.8 billion decrease to the Corporate ACL due to shorter\nremaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more\nspecific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 1 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on\nthe impact of Citi\u2019s adoption of CECL.\n\n(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable\npost-charge-off third-party collection costs which was recorded\nas an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening allowance for\ncredit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\n(3) Includes all adjustments to the ACL, such as changes in the\nallowance from acquisitions, dispositions, securitizations, FX\ntranslation, purchase accounting adjustments, etc.\n\n(4) 2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related\nto the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios.\nIn addition, 2020 includes an increase of approximately $97\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(5) 2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million\nrelated to the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan\nportfolios. In addition, 2019 includes an increase of\napproximately $60 million related to FX translation.\n\n(6) 2018 includes reductions of approximately $201 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios, which include approximately $91 million related to\nthe transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In\naddition, 2018 includes a reduction of approximately $60 million\nrelated to FX translation.\n\n(7) 2017 includes reductions of approximately $261 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios, which include approximately $106 million related to\nthe transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In\naddition, 2017 includes an increase of approximately $115\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(8) 2016 includes reductions of approximately $574 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios, which include approximately $106 million related to\nthe transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS. In\naddition, 2016 includes a reduction of approximately $199\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(9) December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 exclude $6.9\nbillion, $4.1 billion, $3.2 billion, $4.4 billion and $3.5\nbillion, respectively, of loans which are carried at fair value.\n\n(10) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of\n$68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees.\nThe reserves on these contracts were reclassified out of the ACL\non unfunded lending commitments and into other liabilities.\n\n(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(12) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses in the\nportfolio.and troubled debt restructurings. See \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and Significant Estimates\u201d and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements below. Attribution of the ACLL\nis made for analytical purposes only and the entire ACLL is\navailable to absorb credit losses in the overall portfolio.\nPrior to 2020, the ACLL represented management\u2019s estimate of\nprobable losses inherent in the portfolio, as well as probable\nlosses related to large individually evaluated impaired loans\nand TDRs.

The\nfollowing summary provides a\ngeneral description of each\ncategory.\n\nNon-Accrual Loans and Assets :\n\n\u2022 Corporate and consumer\n(including commercial banking)\nnon-accrual status is based on\nthe determination that payment\nof interest or principal is\ndoubtful.\n\n\u2022 A corporate loan may be\nclassified as non-accrual and\nstill be performing under the\nterms of the loan structure.\nNon-accrual loans may still be\ncurrent on interest payments.\nApproximately 59%, 58% and 44%\nof Citi\u2019s corporate non-\naccrual loans were performing\nat December 31, 2020,\nSeptember 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n\n\u2022 Consumer non-accrual status\nis generally based on aging,\ni.e., the borrower has fallen\nbehind on payments.\n\n\u2022 Consumer mortgage loans,\nother than Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA) insured\nloans, are classified as non-\naccrual within 60 days of\nnotification that the borrower\nhas filed for bankruptcy. In\naddition, home equity loans\nare classified as non-accrual\nif the related residential\nfirst mortgage loan is 90 days\nor more past due.\n\n\u2022 North America Citi-branded\ncards and Citi retail services\nare not included because,\nunder industry standards,\ncredit card loans accrue\ninterest until such loans are\ncharged off, which typically\noccurs at 180 days of\ncontractual delinquency.\n\nRenegotiated Loans :\n\n\u2022 Includes both corporate and\nconsumer loans whose terms\nhave been modified in a\ntroubled debt restructuring\n(TDR).\n\n\u2022 Includes both accrual and\nnon-accrual TDRs.\n                               87                               \n                                                                \n  Non-Accrual Loans                                             \n                                                                \nThe table below summarizes\nCitigroup\u2019s non-accrual loans\nas of the periods indicated.\nNon-accrual loans may still be\ncurrent on interest payments.\nIn situations where Citi\nreasonably expects that only a\nportion of the principal owed\nwill ultimately be collected,\nall payments received are\nreflected as a reduction of\nprincipal and not as interest\nincome.

Funding and\nliquidity risks arise from\nseveral factors, many of which\nare mostly or entirely outside\nCiti\u2019s control, such as\ndisruptions in the financial\nmarkets, changes in key\nfunding sources, credit\nspreads, changes in Citi\u2019s\ncredit ratings and\nmacroeconomic, geopolitical\nand other conditions. For\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Liquidity\nRisks\u201d above.\n\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nmanagement objectives are\naimed at (i) funding its\nexisting asset base, (ii)\ngrowing its core businesses,\n(iii) maintaining sufficient\nliquidity, structured\nappropriately, so that Citi\ncan operate under a variety of\nadverse circumstances,\nincluding potential Company-\nspecific and/or market\nliquidity events in varying\ndurations and severity, and\n(iv) satisfying regulatory\nrequirements, including, among\nother things, those related to\nresolution planning (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cResolution Plan\u201d and \u201cTotal\nLoss-Absorbing Capacity\n(TLAC)\u201d below). Citigroup\u2019s\nprimary liquidity objectives\nare established by entity, and\nin aggregate, across two major\ncategories:\n\n\u2022 Citibank (including Citibank\nEurope plc, Citibank Singapore\nLtd. and Citibank (Hong Kong)\nLtd.); and\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s non-bank and other\nentities, including the parent\nholding company (Citigroup\nInc.), Citi\u2019s primary\nintermediate holding company\n(Citicorp LLC), Citi\u2019s broker-\ndealer subsidiaries (including\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc.,\nCitigroup Global Markets Ltd.\nand Citigroup Global Markets\nJapan Inc.) and other bank and\nnon-bank subsidiaries that are\nconsolidated into Citigroup\n(including Citibanamex).\n\nAt an aggregate Citigroup\nlevel, Citi\u2019s goal is to\nmaintain sufficient funding in\namount and tenor to fully fund\ncustomer assets and to provide\nan appropriate amount of cash\nand high-quality liquid assets\n(as discussed below), even in\ntimes of stress, in order to\nmeet its payment obligations\nas they come due. The\nliquidity risk management\nframework provides that in\naddition to the aggregate\nrequirements, certain entities\nbe self-sufficient or net\nproviders of liquidity,\nincluding in conditions\nestablished under their\ndesignated stress tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s primary sources of\nfunding include (i) deposits\nvia Citi\u2019s bank subsidiaries,\nwhich are Citi\u2019s most stable\nand lowest cost source of\nlong-term funding, (ii) long-\nterm debt (primarily senior\nand subordinated debt)\nprimarily issued at the parent\nand certain bank subsidiaries,\nand (iii) stockholders\u2019\nequity. These sources may be\nsupplemented by short-term\nborrowings, primarily in the\nform of secured funding\ntransactions.\n\nAs referenced above, Citi\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity\nframework ensures that the\ntenor of these funding sources\nis of sufficient term in\nrelation to the tenor of its\nasset base. The goal of Citi\u2019s\nasset/liability management is\nto ensure that there is\nsufficient liquidity and tenor\nin the liability structure\nrelative to the liquidity\nprofile of the assets. This\nreduces the risk that\nliabilities will become due\nbefore assets mature or are\nmonetized. This excess\nliquidity is held primarily in\nthe form of high-quality\nliquid assets (HQLA), as set\nforth in the table below.\n\nCiti\u2019s liquidity is managed\nvia a centralized treasury\nmodel by Treasury, in\nconjunction with regional and\nin-country treasurers with\noversight provided by\nIndependent Risk Management\nand various Asset & Liability\nCommittees (ALCOs) at the\nCitigroup, region, country and\nbusiness levels. Pursuant to\nthis approach, Citi\u2019s HQLA is\nmanaged with emphasis on\nasset-liability management and\nentity-level liquidity\nadequacy throughout Citi.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer and\nCiti\u2019s CFO co-chair\nCitigroup\u2019s ALCO, which\nincludes Citi\u2019s Treasurer and\nother senior executives.\nALCOs, among other things, set\nthe strategy of the liquidity\nportfolio and monitor its\nperformance. Significant\nchanges to portfolio asset\nallocations need to be\napproved by the ALCOs.\n                                                                \n  Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                \nLiquidity stress testing is\nperformed for each of Citi\u2019s\nmajor entities, operating\nsubsidiaries and/or countries.\nStress testing and scenario\nanalyses are intended to\nquantify the potential impact\nof an adverse liquidity event\non the balance sheet and\nliquidity position, and to\nidentify viable funding\nalternatives that can be\nutilized. These scenarios\ninclude assumptions about\nsignificant changes in key\nfunding sources, market\ntriggers (such as credit\nratings), potential uses of\nfunding and macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nconditions. These conditions\ninclude expected and stressed\nmarket conditions as well as\nCompany-specific events.\n\nLiquidity stress tests are\nperformed to ascertain\npotential mismatches between\nliquidity sources and uses\nover a variety of time\nhorizons and over different\nstressed conditions. To\nmonitor the liquidity of an\nentity, these stress tests and\npotential mismatches are\ncalculated with varying\nfrequencies, with several\ntests performed daily.\n\nGiven the range of potential\nstresses, Citi maintains\ncontingency funding plans on a\nconsolidated basis and for\nindividual entities.

These amounts\ninclude the HQLA needed to\nmeet the minimum requirements\nat these entities and any\namounts in excess of these\nminimums that are assumed to\nbe transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup.\nCitigroup\u2019s HQLA increased\nquarter-over-quarter as of the\nfourth quarter of 2020,\nprimarily reflecting an\nincrease in average long-term\nnon-bank debt. While deposit\ngrowth and a decline in loans\nincreased liquidity at\nCitibank, a significant amount\nof this liquidity was assumed\nnot to be transferable to\nother entities within\nCitigroup and therefore not\nincluded in Citi\u2019s\nconsolidated HQLA . As of\nDecember 31, 2020, Citigroup\nhad $972 billion of available\nliquidity resources to support\nclient and business needs,\nincluding end-of-period HQLA\nassets; additional\nunencumbered securities,\nincluding excess liquidity\nheld at bank entities that is\nnon-transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup; and\navailable assets not already\naccounted for within Citi\u2019s\nHQLA to support Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and Federal\nReserve Bank discount window\nborrowing capacity.\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR. Generally, the LCR is\ndesigned to ensure that banks\nmaintain an adequate level of\nHQLA to meet liquidity needs\nunder an acute 30-day stress\nscenario. The LCR is\ncalculated by dividing HQLA by\nestimated net outflows over a\nstressed 30-day period, with\nthe net outflows determined by\napplying prescribed outflow\nfactors to various categories\nof liabilities, such as\ndeposits, unsecured and\nsecured wholesale borrowings,\nunused lending commitments and\nderivatives-related exposures,\npartially offset by inflows\nfrom assets maturing within 30\ndays. Banks are required to\ncalculate an add-on to address\npotential maturity mismatches\nbetween contractual cash\noutflows and inflows within\nthe 30-day period in\ndetermining the total amount\nof net outflows. The minimum\nLCR requirement is 100%.

The intended\npurpose of the final rule is\nto support the ability of\nfinancial institutions to\nprovide financial\nintermediation to businesses\nand households across a range\nof market conditions and\nreduce the possibility of\nfunding shocks compromising a\nfinancial institution\u2019s\nliquidity position. In\ngeneral, a bank\u2019s available\nstable funding will include\nportions of equity, deposits\nand long-term debt, while its\nrequired stable funding will\nbe based on the liquidity\ncharacteristics of its assets,\nderivatives and commitments.\nStandardized weightings will\nbe required to be applied to\nthe various asset and\nliabilities classes. The ratio\nof available stable funding to\nrequired stable funding will\nbe required to be greater than\n100%. The final rule becomes\neffective beginning July 1,\n2021 while public disclosure\nrequirements to report the\nratio will occur on a semi-\nannual basis beginning June\n30, 2023. Citi expects to be\nin compliance with the final\nrule when the rule is\neffective. Loans As part of\nits funding and liquidity\nobjectives, Citi seeks to fund\nits existing asset base\nappropriately as well as\nmaintain sufficient liquidity\nto grow its GCB and ICG\nbusinesses, including its loan\nportfolio.

End-of-period\ndeposits increased 20% year-\nover-year and 1% sequentially.\nAs of the fourth quarter of\n2020, on an average basis,\ndeposits increased 20% year-\nover-year and 3% sequentially.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, average deposits\ngrew 19% from the prior-year\nperiod and 2% sequentially,\nreflecting continued client\nengagement as well as the\nelevated level of liquidity in\nthe financial system. On this\nbasis, average deposits in GCB\nincreased 18%, with strong\ngrowth across all regions.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, average deposits\nin ICG grew 20% year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by 22%\n                               93                               \ngrowth in TTS, as well as\ncontinued growth in the\nprivate bank and securities\nservices. Long-Term Debt Long-\nterm debt (generally defined\nas debt with original\nmaturities of one year or\nmore) represents the most\nsignificant component of\nCiti\u2019s funding for the\nCitigroup parent company and\nCiti\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries\nand is a supplementary source\nof funding for the bank\nentities. Long-term debt is an\nimportant funding source due\nin part to its multiyear\ncontractual maturity\nstructure. The weighted-\naverage maturity of unsecured\nlong-term debt issued by\nCitigroup and its affiliates\n(including Citibank) with a\nremaining life greater than\none year was approximately 8.6\nyears as of December 31, 2020,\nunchanged from September 30,\n2020 and an increase from the\nprior year. The weighted-\naverage maturity is calculated\nbased on the contractual\nmaturity of each security. For\nsecurities that are redeemable\nprior to maturity at the\noption of the holder, the\nweighted-average maturity is\ncalculated based on the\nearliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable. Citi\u2019s\nlong-term debt outstanding at\nthe Citigroup parent company\nincludes benchmark senior and\nsubordinated debt and what\nCiti refers to as customer-\nrelated debt, consisting of\nstructured notes, such as\nequity- and credit-linked\nnotes, as well as non-\nstructured notes. Citi\u2019s\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt is generally driven by\ncustomer demand and\ncomplements benchmark debt\nissuance as a source of\nfunding for Citi\u2019s non-bank\nentities. Citi\u2019s long-term\ndebt at the bank includes bank\nnotes, FHLB advances and\nsecuritizations.\n\nLong-Term Debt Outstanding The\nfollowing table sets forth\nCiti\u2019s end-of-period total\nlong-term debt outstanding for\neach of the dates indicated:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  billions                                                      \n  of                Dec. 31,        Sept. 30,         Dec. 31,  \n  dollars               2020             2020             2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Non-bank\u2026                                                     \n  Benchmark                                                     \n  debt:                                                         \n  Senior       $       126.2    $       126.3    $       106.6  \n  debt                                                          \n  Subordin\u2026             27.1             27.4             25.5  \n  debt                                                          \n  Trust                  1.7              1.7              1.7  \n  preferred                                                     \n  Customer\u2026             65.2             61.0             53.8  \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                6.7              8.1              7.9  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $       226.9    $       224.5    $       195.5  \n  non-bank                                                      \n  Bank                                                          \n  FHLB         $        10.9    $        14.7    $         5.5  \n  borrowin\u2026                                                     \n  Securiti\u2026             16.6             16.4             20.7  \n  Citibank                                                      \n  benchmark             13.6             14.2             23.1  \n  senior                                                        \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                3.7              3.5              4.0  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $        44.8    $        48.8    $        53.3  \n  bank                                                          \n  Total                                                         \n  long-term    $       271.7    $       273.3    $       248.8  \n  debt                                                          \n                                                                \nNote: Amounts represent the\ncurrent value of long-term\ndebt on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet that, for\ncertain debt instruments,\nincludes consideration of fair\nvalue, hedging impacts and\nunamortized discounts and\npremiums.

As of December 31,\n2020, non-bank included $56.4\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries, as\nwell as certain Citigroup\nconsolidated hedging\nactivities. (2) Local country\nand other includes debt issued\nby Citi\u2019s affiliates in\nsupport of their local\noperations. Within non-bank,\ncertain secured financing is\nalso included. Within bank,\nborrowings under certain U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored liquidity\nprograms are also included.\n(3) Predominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Citi-branded credit\ncard receivables. As of the\nfourth quarter of 2020, Citi\u2019s\ntotal long-term debt\noutstanding increased year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nthe issuance of unsecured\nbenchmark senior debt and\ncustomer-related debt at the\nnon-bank entities, as well as\nan increase in FHLB borrowings\nat the bank, partially offset\nby declines in unsecured\nbenchmark senior debt and\nsecuritizations at the bank.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding decreased, driven\nprimarily by a decline in FHLB\nborrowings at the bank and\nlocal country and other debt\nat the non-bank, partially\noffset by higher customer-\nrelated debt at the non-bank.\nAs part of its liability\nmanagement, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs.

and FRB to\nperiodically submit a plan for\nCiti\u2019s rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event\nof material financial distress\nor failure. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\nresolution plan submissions,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisks\u201d above. Citigroup\u2019s\npreferred resolution strategy\nis \u201csingle point of entry\u201d\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode.\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s preferred \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d resolution\nplan strategy, only Citigroup,\nthe parent holding company,\nwould enter into bankruptcy,\nwhile Citigroup\u2019s material\nlegal entities (as defined in\nthe public section of its 2019\nresolution plan, which can be\nfound on the FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s\nwebsites) would remain\noperational outside of any\nresolution or insolvency\nproceedings. Citigroup\u2019s\nresolution plan has been\ndesigned to minimize the risk\nof systemic impact to the U.S.\nand global financial systems,\nwhile maximizing the value of\nthe bankruptcy estate for the\nbenefit of Citigroup\u2019s\ncreditors, including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders.\n\nIn addition, in line with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s final total\nloss-absorbing capacity (TLAC)\nrule, Citigroup believes it\nhas developed the resolution\nplan so that Citigroup\u2019s\nshareholders and unsecured\ncreditors\u2014including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders\u2014bear any losses\nresulting from Citigroup\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Accordingly, any\nvalue realized by holders of\nits unsecured long-term debt\nmay not be sufficient to repay\nthe amounts owed to such debt\nholders in the event of a\nbankruptcy or other resolution\nproceeding of Citigroup.\n\nThe FDIC has also indicated\nthat it was developing a\nsingle point of entry strategy\nto implement the Orderly\nLiquidation Authority under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, which provides the FDIC\nwith the ability to resolve a\nfirm when it is determined\nthat bankruptcy would have\nserious adverse effects on\nfinancial stability in the\nU.S.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in\nresponse to feedback received\nfrom the Federal Reserve and\nFDIC, Citigroup took the\nfollowing actions:\n\n(i) Citicorp LLC (Citicorp),\nan existing wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Citigroup, was\nestablished as an intermediate\nholding company (an IHC) for\ncertain of Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities;\n\n(ii) Citigroup executed an\ninter-affiliate agreement with\nCiticorp, Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities and certain other\naffiliated entities pursuant\nto which Citicorp is required\nto provide liquidity and\ncapital support to Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities in the event\nCitigroup were to enter\nbankruptcy proceedings (Citi\nSupport Agreement);\n\n(iii) pursuant to the Citi\nSupport Agreement:\n\n\u2022 Citigroup made an initial\ncontribution of assets,\nincluding certain high-quality\nliquid assets and inter-\naffiliate loans (Contributable\nAssets), to Citicorp, and\nCiticorp became the business-\nas-usual funding vehicle for\nCitigroup\u2019s operating material\nlegal entities;\n\n\u2022 Citigroup will be obligated\nto continue to transfer\nContributable Assets to\nCiticorp over time, subject to\ncertain amounts retained by\nCitigroup to, among other\nthings, meet Citigroup\u2019s near-\nterm cash needs;\n\n\u2022 in the event of a Citigroup\nbankruptcy, Citigroup will be\nrequired to contribute most of\nits remaining assets to\nCiticorp; and\n\n(iv) the obligations of both\nCitigroup and Citicorp under\nthe Citi Support Agreement, as\nwell as the Contributable\nAssets, are secured pursuant\nto a security agreement.\n\nThe Citi Support Agreement\nprovides two mechanisms,\nbesides Citicorp\u2019s issuing of\ndividends to Citigroup,\npursuant to which Citicorp\nwill be required to transfer\ncash to Citigroup during\nbusiness as usual so that\nCitigroup can fund its debt\nservice as well as other\noperating needs: (i) one or\nmore funding notes issued by\nCiticorp to Citigroup and (ii)\na committed line of credit\nunder which Citicorp may make\nloans to Citigroup.\n\nOn December 17, 2019, the FRB\nand FDIC issued feedback on\nthe resolution plans filed on\nJuly 1, 2019 by the eight U.S.\nGSIBs, including Citi. The FRB\nand FDIC identified one\nshortcoming, but no\ndeficiencies, in Citi\u2019s\nresolution plan relating to\ngovernance mechanisms. On July\n1, 2020, the FRB and FDIC\nprovided information to the\neight largest domestic banking\norganizations, including Citi,\nrequired to be included in the\ntargeted resolution plans due\non July 1, 2021.\n                                                                \n  Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)                          \n                                                                \nU.S. GSIBs are required to\nmaintain minimum levels of\nTLAC and eligible LTD, each\nset by reference to the GSIB\u2019s\nconsolidated risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and total\nleverage exposure. The\nintended purpose of the\nrequirements is to facilitate\nthe orderly resolution of U.S.\nGSIBs under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code and Title II\nof the Dodd-Frank Act. For\nadditional information,\nincluding Citi\u2019s TLAC and LTD\namounts and ratios, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Current\nRegulatory Capital Standards\u201d\nand \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Compliance\nRisks\u201d above.\n                               96                               \nSECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS\nAND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $200\nbillion as of December 31,\n2020 increased 20% from the\nprior year and declined 4%\nfrom the prior quarter.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, secured funding\ndecreased 16% from the prior\nyear and declined 7%\nsequentially, both driven by\nnormal business activity.\nAverage balances for secured\nfunding were $227 billion for\nthe quarter ended December 31,\n2020.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury\n\nsecurities, U.S. agency\nsecurities and foreign\ngovernment debt\n\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $30 billion as of the\nfourth quarter of 2020\ndecreased 34% year-over-year\nand 21% sequentially,\nprimarily driven by a decline\nin FHLB advances (see Note 17\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                                                                \n  Overall Short-Term Borrowings                                 \n                                                                \nThe following table contains the year-end, average and maximum\nmonth-end amounts for the following respective short-term\nborrowings categories at the end of each of the three prior\nyears:\n                                                                \n          \u2026                                                     \n          \u2026                                                     \n          \u2026                                                     \n  \u2026       \u2026                                                     \n  \u2026       \u2026                           O\u2026                        \n  \u2026       \u2026                           b\u2026                        \n  \u2026       \u2026        2\u2026        \u2026        2\u2026        \u2026        2\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026    $  \u2026     $  1\u2026     $  \u2026     $  8\u2026     $  \u2026     $  9\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       \u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       \u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        1\u2026        \u2026        1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       \u2026  %     3\u2026  %     \u2026  %     0\u2026  %     \u2026  %     2\u2026  %  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n                                                                \n(1) Original maturities of less than one year.\n\n(2) Other borrowings include commercial paper, brokerage\npayables and borrowings from the FHLB and other market\nparticipants.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Liquidity Risks\u201d\nabove.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $0.6 billion,\nunchanged from September 30,\n2020. Other funding sources,\nsuch as secured financing\ntransactions and other margin\nrequirements, for which there\nare no explicit triggers,\ncould also be adversely\naffected.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.4\nbillion, unchanged from\nSeptember 30, 2020. Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured financing transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely affected.\n\nIn total, as of December 31,\n2020, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup and Citibank across\nall three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$1.0 billion, unchanged from\nSeptember 30, 2020 (see also\nNote 22 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings at certain Citibank\nsubsidiaries. Mitigating\nactions available to Citibank\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, selling or financing\nhighly liquid government\nsecurities, tailoring levels\nof secured lending, adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nassets, reducing loan\noriginations and renewals,\nraising additional deposits or\nborrowing from the FHLB or\ncentral banks. Citi believes\nthese mitigating actions could\nsubstantially reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above.\n                               98                               \n                                                                \n  Citibank\u2014Additional Potential Impacts                         \n                                                                \nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of December 31,\n2020, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximately\n$10.0 billion to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, compared to $11.4\nbillion as of September 30,\n2020 (fo r additional\ninformation, see Note 21 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               99                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  OVERVIEW                                                      \n                                                                \nMarket risk is the potential\nfor losses arising from\nchanges in the value of Citi\u2019s\nassets and liabilities\nresulting from changes in\nmarket variables such as\ninterest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices,\ncommodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their\nimplied volatilities.

In all\ncases, the businesses are\nultimately responsible for the\nmarket risks taken and for\nremaining within their defined\nlimits.\n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS                         \n                                                                \nMarket risk from non-trading\nportfolios stems from the\npotential impact of changes in\ninterest rates and foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s net\ninterest revenues, the changes\nin Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) from its debt\nsecurities portfolios and\ncapital invested in foreign\ncurrencies.\n                                                                \n  Net Interest Revenue at Risk                                  \n                                                                \nNet interest revenue, for\ninterest rate exposure\npurposes, is the difference\nbetween the yield earned on\nthe non-trading portfolio\nassets (including customer\nloans) and the rate paid on\nthe liabilities (including\ncustomer deposits or company\nborrowings). Net interest\nrevenue is affected by changes\nin the level of interest\nrates, as well as the amounts\nand mix of assets and\nliabilities, and the timing of\ncontractual and assumed\nrepricing of assets and\nliabilities to reflect market\nrates.\n\nCiti\u2019s principal measure of\nrisk to net interest revenue\nis interest rate exposure\n(IRE). IRE measures the change\nin expected net interest\nrevenue in each currency\nresulting solely from\nunanticipated changes in\nforward interest rates.\n\nCiti\u2019s estimated IRE\nincorporates various\nassumptions including\nprepayment rates on loans,\ncustomer behavior and the\nimpact of pricing decisions.\nFor example, in rising\ninterest rate scenarios,\nportions of the deposit\nportfolio may be assumed to\nexperience rate increases that\nare less than the change in\nmarket interest rates. In\ndeclining interest rate\nscenarios, it is assumed that\nmortgage portfolios experience\nhigher prepayment rates.\nCiti\u2019s estimated IRE below\nassumes that its businesses\nand/or Citi Treasury make no\nadditional changes in balances\nor positioning in response to\nthe unanticipated rate\nchanges.\n\nIn order to manage changes in\ninterest rates effectively,\nCiti may modify pricing on new\ncustomer loans and deposits,\npurchase fixed-rate\nsecurities, issue debt that is\neither fixed or floating or\nenter into derivative\ntransactions that have the\nopposite risk exposures. Citi\nregularly assesses the\nviability of\n\nthese and other strategies to\nreduce its interest rate risks\nand implements such strategies\nwhen it believes those actions\nare prudent.\n\nCiti manages interest rate\nrisk as a consolidated\nCompany-wide position. Citi\u2019s\nclient-facing businesses\ncreate interest rate-sensitive\npositions, including loans and\ndeposits, as part of their\nongoing activities. Citi\nTreasury aggregates these risk\npositions and manages them\ncentrally. Operating within\nestablished limits, Citi\nTreasury makes positioning\ndecisions and uses tools, such\nas Citi\u2019s investment\nsecurities portfolio, company-\nissued debt and interest rate\nderivatives, to target the\ndesired risk profile. Changes\nin Citi\u2019s interest rate risk\nposition reflect the\naccumulated changes in all\nnon-trading assets and\nliabilities, with potentially\nlarge and offsetting impacts,\nas well as in Citi Treasury\u2019s\npositioning decisions.\n\nCitigroup employs additional\nmeasurements, including stress\ntesting the impact of non-\nlinear interest rate movements\non the value of the balance\nsheet, and the analysis of\nportfolio duration and\nvolatility, particularly as\nthey relate to mortgage loans\nand mortgage-backed securities\nand the potential impact of\nthe change in the spread\nbetween different market\nindices.\n\nInterest Rate Risk of\nInvestment Portfolios\u2014Impact\n\non AOCI\n\nCiti also measures the\npotential impacts of changes\nin interest rates on the value\nof its AOCI , which can in\nturn impact Citi\u2019s common\nequity and tangible common\nequity. This will impact\nCiti\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\nand other regulatory capital\nratios. Citi\u2019s goal is to\nbenefit from an increase in\nthe market level of interest\nrates, while limiting the\nimpact of changes in AOCI on\nits regulatory capital\nposition.\n\nAOCI at risk is managed as\npart of the Company-wide\ninterest rate risk position.\nAOCI at risk considers\npotential changes in AOCI (and\nthe corresponding impact on\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio) relative to\nCiti\u2019s capital generation\ncapacity.\n                              100                               \nThe following table sets forth the estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue, AOCI and the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio (on a fully implemented basis), each assuming an\nunanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 basis point (bps)\nincrease in interest rates:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millions                                                      \n  of                                                            \n  dollars,                                                      \n  except                                                        \n  as                                                            \n  otherwi\u2026        Dec. 31,        Sept. 30,        Dec. 31,     \n  noted               2020             2020            2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimat\u2026                                                      \n  annuali\u2026                                                      \n  impact                                                        \n  to net                                                        \n  interest                                                      \n  revenue                                                       \n  U.S.        $        373     $         65     $        20     \n  dollar(\u2026                                                      \n  All                                                           \n  other                683              702             606     \n  currenc\u2026                                                      \n  Total       $      1,056     $        767     $       626     \n  As a                                                          \n  percent\u2026                                                      \n  of                  0.05  %          0.04  %         0.03  %  \n  average                                                       \n  interes\u2026                                                      \n  assets                                                        \n  Estimat\u2026                                                      \n  initial                                                       \n  negative    $     -5,645     $     -5,757     $    -5,002     \n  impact                                                        \n  toAOCI(\u2026                                                      \n  Estimat\u2026                                                      \n  initial                                                       \n  impact                                                        \n  on                                                            \n  Common               -34              -36             -31     \n  Equity                                                        \n  Tier 1                                                        \n  Capital                                                       \n  ratio                                                         \n  (bps)                                                         \n                                                                \n(1) Certain trading-oriented\nbusinesses within Citi have\naccrual-accounted positions\nthat are excluded from the\nestimated impact to net\ninterest revenue in the table,\nsince these exposures are\nmanaged economically in\ncombination with mark-to-\nmarket positions. The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(89) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof December 31, 2020.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nThe year-over-year increase in\nthe estimated impact to net\ninterest revenue primarily\nreflected changes in Citi\u2019s\nbalance sheet composition and\nCiti Treasury positioning. The\nyear-over-year changes in the\nestimated impact to AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio primarily\nreflected the impact of the\ncomposition of Citi Treasury\u2019s\ninvestment and derivatives\nportfolio.\n\nIn the event of a parallel\ninstantaneous 100 bps increase\nin interest rates, Citi\nexpects that the negative\nimpact to AOCI would be offset\nin shareholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio over a period of\ntime. As of December 31, 2020,\nCiti expects that the negative\n$5.6 billion impact to AOCI in\nsuch a scenario could\npotentially be offset over\napproximately 31 months.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity\n\nTier 1 Capital ratio (on a\nfully implemented basis) under\nfive different changes in\ninterest rate scenarios for\nthe U.S. dollar and Citi\u2019s\nother currencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d). The rate\nscenarios are also impacted by\nconvexity related to mortgage\nproducts.\n\nIn addition, in the table\nbelow, the magnitude of the\nimpact to Citi\u2019s net interest\nrevenue and AOCI is greater\nunder Scenario 2 as compared\nto Scenario 3. This is because\nthe combination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  of                                                            \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  ex\u2026                                                           \n  as                                                            \n  ot\u2026                                                           \n  no\u2026                                                           \n  Ov\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  10\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  an\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to        Sce\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026  \n  net          1          2           3          4           5  \n  in\u2026        100        100           \u2014          \u2014       (100)  \n  re\u2026        100          \u2014         100       (10\u2026       (100)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.\u2026    $   373    $   348    $    141    $  -113    $   -217  \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  All                                                           \n  ot\u2026        683        489          42        -42        -342  \n  cu\u2026                                                           \n  To\u2026    $  1,0\u2026    $   837    $    183    $  -155    $   -559  \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  -5,\u2026    $  -3,\u2026    $  -1,9\u2026    $  1,3\u2026    $  2,472  \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to                                                            \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  Eq\u2026        -34        -24         -12          7           9  \n  Ti\u2026                                                           \n  1                                                             \n  Ca\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur\ninstantaneously.

This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nEuro, Australian dollar and\nSingapore dollar.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency translation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the impact\nof these changes on Citi\u2019s TCE\nand Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

Citi\u2019s market risk\nmanagement, within the Risk\norganization, works to ensure\nthat factor sensitivities are\ncalculated, monitored and\nlimited for all material risks\ntaken in the trading\nportfolios.\n                                                                \n  Value at Risk (VAR)                                           \n                                                                \nVAR estimates, at a 99%\nconfidence level, the\npotential decline in the value\nof a position or a portfolio\nunder normal market conditions\nassuming a one-day holding\nperiod. VAR statistics, which\nare based on historical data,\ncan be materially different\nacross firms due to\ndifferences in portfolio\ncomposition, differences in\nVAR methodologies and\ndifferences in model\nparameters. As a result, Citi\nbelieves VAR statistics can be\nused more effectively as\nindicators of trends in risk-\ntaking within a firm, rather\nthan as a basis for inferring\ndifferences in risk-taking\nacross firms.\n\nCiti uses a single,\nindependently approved Monte\nCarlo simulation VAR model\n(see \u201cVAR Model Review and\nValidation\u201d below), which has\nbeen designed to capture\nmaterial risk sensitivities\n(such as first- and second-\norder sensitivities of\npositions to changes in market\nprices) of various asset\nclasses/risk types (such as\ninterest rate, credit\n\nspread, foreign exchange,\nequity and commodity risks).\nCiti\u2019s VAR includes positions\nthat are measured at fair\nvalue; it does not include\ninvestment securities\nclassified as AFS or HTM. For\ninformation on these\nsecurities, see Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nCiti believes its VAR model is\nconservatively calibrated to\nincorporate fat-tail scaling\nand the greater of short-term\n(approximately the most recent\nmonth) and long-term (three\nyears) market volatility. The\nMonte Carlo simulation\ninvolves approximately 450,000\nmarket factors, making use of\napproximately 350,000 time\nseries, with sensitivities\nupdated daily, volatility\nparameters updated intra-\nmonthly and correlation\nparameters updated monthly.\nThe conservative features of\nthe VAR calibration contribute\nan approximate 32% add-on to\nwhat would be a VAR estimated\nunder the assumption of stable\nand perfectly, normally\ndistributed markets.\n\nAs set forth in the table\nbelow, Citi\u2019s average trading\nVAR increased from 2019 to\n2020, mainly due to\nsignificant market volatility\nduring the first half of 2020\nacross all asset classes,\ndriven by macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties\nrelated to the COVID-19\npandemic. Citi\u2019s average\ntrading and credit portfolio\nVAR also increased in 2020,\nprimarily due to the higher\nmarket volatility, increased\nhedging activity and changes\nin portfolio composition.\n\nYear-end and Average Trading\nVAR and Trading and Credit\nPortfolio VAR\n                                                                \n  In

In addition, product specific back-testing on\nportfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing\nmodel performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi\u2019s\nU.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting (as described below) is performed against buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios\nacross the organization (trading desk level, ICG business\nsegment and Citigroup) and the results are shared with U.S.\nbanking regulators. Material VAR model and assumption changes\nmust be independently validated within Citi\u2019s risk management\norganization. All model changes, including those for the VAR\nmodel, are validated by the model validation group within Citi\u2019s\nModel Risk Management. In the event of significant model\nchanges, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to\nimplementation. In addition, significant model and assumption\nchanges are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by\nCiti\u2019s U.S. banking regulators. Citi uses the same independently\nvalidated VAR model for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management\nVAR (i.e., total trading and total trading and credit portfolios\nVARs) and, as such, the model review and validation process for\nboth purposes is as described above. Regulatory VAR, which is\ncalculated in accordance with Basel III, differs from Risk\nManagement VAR due to the fact that certain positions included\nin Risk Management VAR are not eligible for market risk\ntreatment in Regulatory VAR. The composition of Risk Management\nVAR is discussed under\n\n\u201cValue at Risk\u201d above. The applicability of the VAR model for\npositions eligible for market risk treatment under U.S.\nregulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved\nby Citi\u2019s U.S. banking regulators. In accordance with Basel III,\nRegulatory VAR includes all trading book-covered positions and\nall foreign exchange and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel\nIII, Regulatory VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the\nintent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore\nclassified as non-trading book and categories of exposures that\nare specifically excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR\nexcludes CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi\u2019s own\nfair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from\nRegulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as\ncomputed under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-\nweighted assets. Regulatory VAR Back-Testing In accordance with\nBasel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR\nback-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a\n99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit\nand loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is\nheld constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following\nday). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-\nmarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in\ncovered positions from the close of the previous business day.\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue,\nnet interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year when buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions.\n                              112                               \nThe following graph shows the\ndaily buy-and-hold profit and\nloss associated with Citi\u2019s\ncovered positions compared to\nCiti\u2019s one-day Regulatory VAR\nduring 2020. As of December\n31, 2020, four back-testing\nexceptions were observed at\nthe Citigroup level. These\nexceptions occurred in March\nand were due to losses across\nmultiple businesses during the\nonset of the pandemic-related\nvolatility.\n\nThe difference between the\n65.26% of days with buy-and-\nhold gains for Regulatory VAR\nback-testing and the 97.7% of\ndays with trading, net\ninterest and other revenue\nassociated with Citi\u2019s trading\nbusinesses, shown in the\nhistogram of daily trading-\nrelated revenue below,\nreflects, among other things,\nthat a significant portion of\nCiti\u2019s trading-related revenue\nis not generated from daily\nprice movements on these\npositions and exposures, as\nwell as differences in the\nportfolio composition of\nRegulatory VAR and Risk\nManagement VAR.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold Profit     \n  and Loss(1)\u201412 Months ended December 31, 2020                 \n  In millions of dollars                                        \n                                                                \n(1) Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking\nregulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market\nrevenue movement attributable to the trading position from the\nclose of the previous business day.

In general, changes in\nmarket values are defined over\na one-year horizon. For the\nmost liquid positions and\nmarket factors, changes in\nmarket values are defined over\na shorter two-month horizon.\nThe limited set of positions\nand market factors whose\nmarket value changes are\ndefined over a two-month\nhorizon are those that in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment have\nhistorically remained very\nliquid during financial\ncrises, even as the trading\nliquidity of most other\npositions and market factors\nmaterially declined.\n                              114                               \n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISK                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nOperational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems\nor from external events. This\nincludes legal risk, which is\nthe risk of loss (including\nlitigation costs, settlements,\nand regulatory fines)\nresulting from the failure of\nCiti to comply with laws,\nregulations, prudent ethical\nstandards, and contractual\nobligations in any aspect of\nits businesses, but excludes\nstrategic and reputation\nrisks. Citi also recognizes\nthe impact of operational risk\non the reputation risk\nassociated with Citi\u2019s\nbusiness activities.\n\nOperational risk is inherent\nin Citi\u2019s global business\nactivities, as well as related\nsupport functions, and can\nresult in losses. Citi\nmaintains a comprehensive\nfirm-wide risk taxonomy to\nclassify operational risks\nthat it faces using\nstandardized definitions\nacross the firm\u2019s Operational\nRisk Management Framework (see\ndiscussion below). This\ntaxonomy also supports\nregulatory requirements and\nexpectations inclusive of\nthose related to U.S. Basel\nIII capital requirements, CCAR\nprocess and heightened\nstandards under U.S. banking\nrequirements.\n\nCiti manages operational risk\nconsistent with the overall\nframework described in\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Overview\u201d above. Citi\u2019s\ngoal is to keep operational\nrisk at appropriate levels\nrelative to the\ncharacteristics of its\nbusinesses, the markets in\nwhich it operates, its capital\nand liquidity and the\ncompetitive, economic and\nregulatory environment. This\nincludes effectively managing\noperational risk and\nmaintaining or reducing\noperational risk exposures\nwithin Citi\u2019s operational risk\nappetite.\n\nTo anticipate, mitigate and\ncontrol operational risk,\nCiti\u2019s Independent Operational\nRisk Management group has\nestablished a global-\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework with policies and\npractices for identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\nmitigating, and reporting\noperational risks and the\noverall operating\neffectiveness of the internal\ncontrol environment. As part\nof this framework, Citi has\ndefined its operational risk\nappetite and established a\nmanager\u2019s control assessment\n(MCA) process for self-\nidentification of significant\noperational risks, assessment\nof the performance of key\ncontrols and mitigation of\nresidual risk above acceptable\nlevels.\n\nEach major business segment\nmust implement operational\nrisk processes consistent with\nthe requirements of this\nframework. This includes:\n\n\u2022 Understanding the\noperational risks they are\nexposed to;\n\n\u2022 designing controls to\nmitigate identified risks;\n\n\u2022 establishing key indicators;\n\n\u2022 monitoring and reporting\nwhether the operational risk\nexposures are in or out of\ntheir operational risk\nappetite;\n\n\u2022 having processes in place to\nbring operational risk\nexposures within acceptable\nlevels;\n\n\u2022 periodically estimate and\naggregate the operational\nrisks they are exposed to; and\n\n\u2022 ensuring that sufficient\nresources are available to\nactively improve the\noperational risk environment\nand mitigate emerging risks.\n\nCiti considers operational\nrisks that result from the\nintroduction of new or changes\nto existing products, or\nresult from significant\nchanges in its organizational\nstructures, systems, processes\nand personnel.\n\nCiti has a governance\nstructure for the oversight of\noperational risk exposures\nthrough Business Risk and\nControls Committees (BRCCs),\nwhich include a Citigroup BRCC\nas well as business,\nfunctions, regional and\ncountry BRCCs. BRCCs are\nchaired by the individuals in\nthe first line of defense and\nprovide escalation channels\nfor senior management to\nreview operational risk\nexposures including breaches\nof operational risk appetite,\nkey indicators, operational\nrisk events, and control\nissues. Membership includes\nsenior business and functions\nleadership as well as members\nof the second line of defense.\n\nCiti also has an Operational\nRisk Management Committee that\nprovides senior management of\nthe second line of defense\nrisk organizations with a\nplatform to assess Citi\u2019s\noperational risk profile and\nto review that actions are\ntaken to bring Citi\u2019s\noperational risk exposures\nwithin operational risk\nappetite. Members include\nCiti\u2019s Chief Risk Officer and\nCiti\u2019s Head of Operational\nRisk Management and senior\nmembers of their\norganizations. These members\ncover multiple dimensions of\nrisk management and include\nbusiness and regional Chief\nRisk Officers and senior\noperational risk managers.\n\nIn addition, Independent Risk\nManagement, including the\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup, works proactively with\nCiti\u2019s businesses and\nfunctions to drive a strong\nand embedded operational risk\nmanagement culture and\nframework across Citi. The\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup actively challenges\nbusiness and functions\nimplementation of the\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework requirements and the\nquality of operational risk\nmanagement practices and\noutcomes.\n\nInformation about businesses\u2019\nkey operational risks,\nhistorical operational risk\nlosses and the control\nenvironment is reported by\neach major business segment\nand functional area. Citi\u2019s\noperational risk profile and\nrelated information is\nsummarized and reported to\nsenior management, as well as\nto the Audit and Risk\nCommittees of Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors by the Head of\nOperational Risk Management.\n\nOperational risk is measured\nthrough\n\nOperational Risk Capital and\nOperational Risk Regulatory\nCapital for the Advanced\nApproaches under Basel III.\nProjected operational risk\nlosses under stress scenarios\nare estimated as a required\npart of the Federal Reserve\nBoard\u2019s CCAR process.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s operational risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisk\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Erroneous Revlon-Related Payment                              \n                                                                \nIn August 2020, Citi, as\nadministrative agent for a\nRevlon credit facility, in\naddition to making an interest\npayment, erroneously paid the\nlenders under the facility an\naggregate of approximately\n$894 million, which is an\namount equal to the principal\nbalance of the loan at that\ntime. Human error at Citi and\nat a third-party vendor, and\nlimitations in Citi\u2019s loan\n                              115                               \nprocessing systems, were the\nmain contributing factors.\nAfter a careful assessment of\nthe incident, Citi immediately\nput in additional controls to\nprevent similar loan\ndisbursement errors in the\nfuture, while also embarking\non a major upgrade of the loan\ninfrastructure and controls.\n\nAs of February 26, 2021,\n$389.8 million has been repaid\nto Citi. In August 2020, Citi\ncommenced litigation against\ncertain fund managers of\nlenders that have not returned\nthe remaining $504.2 million\nof erroneously transferred\nfunds, and obtained a\ntemporary restraining order\nagainst the fund managers and\nthose acting with them,\nfreezing the funds from\ntransfer or disbursement. On\nFebruary 16, 2021, the court\nissued a judgment in favor of\nthe defendants, which Citi\nintends to appeal. As a result\nof the court\u2019s decision, Citi\nnow has rights as a creditor\nrelated to the Revlon loan.\nFor additional information,\nsee Notes 27, 29 and 30 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                                \n  Cybersecurity Risk                                            \n                                                                \nCybersecurity risk is the\nbusiness risk associated with\nthe threat posed by a cyber\nattack, cyber breach or the\nfailure to protect Citi\u2019s most\nvital business information\nassets or operations,\nresulting in a financial or\nreputational loss (for\nadditional information, see\nthe operational systems and\ncybersecurity risk factors in\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisks\u201d above). With an\nevolving threat landscape,\never-increasing sophistication\nof cybersecurity attacks and\nuse of new technologies to\nconduct financial\ntransactions, Citi and its\nclients, customers and third\nparties are and will continue\nto be at risk for cyber\nattacks and information\nsecurity incidents. Citi\nrecognizes the significance of\nthese risks and, therefore,\nemploys an intelligence-led\nstrategy to protect against,\ndetect, respond to and recover\nfrom cyber attacks. Further,\nCiti actively participates in\nfinancial industry, government\nand cross-sector knowledge-\nsharing groups to enhance\nindividual and collective\ncyber resilience.\n\nCiti\u2019s technology and\ncybersecurity risk management\nprogram is built on three\nlines of defense. Citi\u2019s first\nline of defense under the\nOffice of the Chief\nInformation Security Officer\nprovides frontline business,\noperational and technical\ncontrols and capabilities to\nprotect against cybersecurity\nrisks, and to respond to cyber\nincidents and data breaches.\nCiti manages these threats\nthrough state-of-the-art\nFusion Centers, which serve as\ncentral command for monitoring\nand coordinating responses to\ncyber threats. The enterprise\ninformation security team is\nresponsible for infrastructure\ndefense and security controls,\nperforming vulnerability\nassessments and third-party\ninformation security\nassessments, employee\nawareness and training\nprograms and security incident\nmanagement, in each case\nworking in coordination with a\nnetwork of information\nsecurity officers who are\nembedded within the businesses\nand functions on a global\nbasis.\n\nCiti\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement-Technology and\nCyber (ORM-T/C) and\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement-Technology and\nInformation Security (ICRM-T)\ngroups serve as the second\nline of defense, and actively\nevaluate, anticipate and\nchallenge Citi\u2019s risk\nmitigation practices and\ncapabilities. Internal audit\nserves as the third line of\ndefense and independently\nprovides assurance on how\n\neffectively the organization\nas a whole manages\ncybersecurity risk. Citi also\nhas multiple senior committees\nsuch as the Information\nSecurity Risk Committee\n(ISRC), which governs\nenterprise-level risk\ntolerance inclusive of\ncybersecurity risk.\n\nCiti seeks to proactively\nidentify and remediate\ntechnology and cybersecurity\nrisks before they materialize\nas incidents that negatively\naffect business operations.\nAccordingly, the ORM-T/C team\nindependently challenges and\nmonitors capabilities in\naccordance with Citi\u2019s defined\nTechnology and Cyber Risk\nAppetite statements. To\naddress evolving cybersecurity\nrisks and corresponding\nregulations, ORM-T/C and\nICRM-T team collectively also\nmonitor cyber legal and\nregulatory requirements,\nidentify and define emerging\nrisks, execute strategic cyber\nthreat assessments, perform\nnew products and initiative\nreviews, perform data\nmanagement risk oversight and\nconduct cyber risk assurance\nreviews (inclusive of third-\nparty assessments). In\naddition, ORM-T/C employs\ntools and oversees and\nchallenges metrics that are\nboth tailored to cybersecurity\nand technology and aligned\nwith Citi\u2019s overall\noperational risk management\nframework to effectively\ntrack, identify and manage\nrisk.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCompliance risk is the risk to\ncurrent or projected financial\ncondition and resilience\narising from violations of\nlaws, rules, or regulations,\nor from non-conformance with\nprescribed practices, internal\npolicies and procedures or\nethical standards. Compliance\nrisk exposes Citi to fines,\ncivil money penalties, payment\nof damages and the voiding of\ncontracts. Compliance risk can\nresult in diminished\nreputation, harm to the firm\u2019s\ncustomers, limited business\nopportunities and lessened\nexpansion potential. It\nencompasses the risk of\nnoncompliance with all laws\nand regulations, as well as\nprudent ethical standards and\nsome contractual obligations.\nIt could also include exposure\nto litigation (known as legal\nrisk) from all aspects of\ntraditional and non-\ntraditional banking.\n\nCiti seeks to operate with\nintegrity, maintain strong\nethical standards and adhere\nto applicable policies and\nregulatory and legal\nrequirements. Citi must\nmaintain and execute a\nproactive Compliance Risk\nManagement (CRM) Policy that\nis designed to manage\ncompliance risk effectively\nacross Citi, with a view to\nfundamentally strengthen the\ncompliance risk management\nculture across the lines of\ndefense taking into account\nCiti\u2019s risk governance\nframework and regulatory\nrequirements. Independent\nCompliance Risk Management\u2019s\n(ICRM) primary objectives are\nto:\n\n\u2022 Drive and embed a culture of\ncompliance and control\nthroughout Citi;\n\n\u2022 Maintain and oversee an\nintegrated CRM Policy and\nCompliance Risk Framework that\nfacilitates enterprise-wide\ncompliance with local,\nnational or cross-border laws,\nrules or regulations, Citi\u2019s\ninternal policies, standards\nand procedures and relevant\nstandards of conduct;\n\n\u2022 Assess compliance risks and\nissues across product lines,\nfunctions and geographies,\nsupported by globally\nconsistent systems and\ncompliance risk management\nprocesses; and\n\n\u2022 Provide compliance risk data\naggregation and reporting\ncapabilities.\n                              116                               \nTo anticipate, control and\nmitigate compliance risk, Citi\nhas established the CRM Policy\nto achieve standardization and\ncentralization of\nmethodologies and processes,\nand to enable more consistent\nand comprehensive execution of\ncompliance risk management.\n\nCiti has a commitment, as well\nas an obligation, to identify,\nassess and mitigate compliance\nrisks associated with its\nbusinesses and functions. ICRM\nis responsible for oversight\nof Citi\u2019s CRM Policy, while\nall businesses and global\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for managing their\ncompliance risks and operating\nwithin the Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nCiti carries out its\nobjectives and fulfills its\nresponsibilities through the\nCompliance Risk Framework,\nwhich is composed of the\nfollowing integrated key\nactivities, to holistically\nmanage compliance risk:\n\n\u2022 Management of Citi\u2019s\ncompliance with laws, rules\nand regulations by identifying\nand analyzing changes,\nassessing the impact, and\nimplementing appropriate\npolicies, processes and\ncontrols.\n\n\u2022 Developing and providing\ncompliance training to ensure\ncolleagues are aware of and\nunderstand the key laws, rules\nand regulations.\n\n\u2022 Monitoring compliance risk\nappetite, which is articulated\nthrough qualitative compliance\nrisk statements describing\nCiti\u2019s appetite for certain\ntypes of risk and quantitative\nmeasures to monitor the\nCompany\u2019s compliance risk\nexposure.\n\n\u2022 Monitoring and testing of\ncompliance risks and controls\nin assessing conformance with\nlaws, rules, regulations and\ninternal policies.\n\n\u2022 Issue identification,\nescalation and remediation to\ndrive accountability,\nincluding measurement and\nreporting of compliance risk\nmetrics against established\nthresholds in support of the\nCRM Policy and Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi is\nworking to address the FRB and\nOCC consent orders, which\ninclude improvements to Citi\u2019s\nCompliance Risk Framework and\nits Enterprise-wide\napplication (for additional\ninformation regarding the\nconsent orders, see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d\nabove).\n                                                                \n  REPUTATION RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s reputation is a vital\nasset in building trust with\nits stakeholders and Citi is\ndiligent in communicating its\ncorporate values to its\ncolleagues, customers,\ninvestors and regulators. To\nsupport this, Citi has defined\na reputation risk appetite\napproach. Under this approach,\neach major business segment\nhas implemented a risk\nappetite statement and related\nkey indicators to monitor and\naddress weaknesses that may\nresult in significant\nreputation risks. The approach\nrequires that each business\nsegment or region escalates\nsignificant reputation risks\nthat require review or\nmitigation through its\nReputation Risk Committee or\nequivalent.\n\nThe Reputation Risk Committees\nare part of the governance\ninfrastructure that Citi has\nin place to review the\nreputation risk posed by\nbusiness activities, sales\npractices, product design, or\nperceived conflicts of\ninterest. These committees may\nalso raise potential\nreputation risks for due\n\nconsideration by the\nReputation Risk Committee at\nthe corporate level. The\nCitigroup Reputation Risk\nCommittee\n\nmay escalate reputation risks\nto the Nomination, Governance\n\nand Public Affairs Committee\nor other appropriate committee\n\nof the Citigroup Board of\nDirectors. The Reputation Risk\nCommittees, which are composed\nof Citi\u2019s most senior\nexecutives, govern the process\nby which material reputation\nrisks are identified,\nmonitored, reported, managed\nand escalated, and appropriate\nactions are taken in line with\nCompany-wide strategic\nobjectives, risk appetite\nthresholds and regulatory\nexpectations, while promoting\nthe culture of risk awareness\nand high standards of\nintegrity and ethical behavior\nacross the Company, consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s mission and value\nproposition.\n\nFurther, the responsibility\nfor maintaining Citi\u2019s\nreputation is shared by all\ncolleagues, who are guided by\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nColleagues are expected to\nexercise sound judgment and\ncommon sense in decisions and\nactions. They are also\nexpected to promptly and\nappropriately escalate all\nissues that present potential\nreputation risk.\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Executive Management\nTeam, led by Citi\u2019s CEO, is\nresponsible for the\ndevelopment and execution of\nCiti\u2019s strategy. This strategy\nis translated into forward-\nlooking plans that are then\ncascaded across the\norganization. Strategic risk\nis monitored through a range\nof practices: regular\nCitigroup Board of Director\nmeetings provide strategic\ncheckpoints where management\u2019s\nprogress is assessed and where\ndecisions to refine the\nstrategic direction of the\nCompany are evaluated; Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team\nassesses progress against\nexecuting the defined plans;\nCEO reviews, which include a\nrisk assessment of the plans,\noccur across products, regions\nand functions to focus on\nprogress against executing the\nplans; products, regions and\nfunctions have internal\nreviews to assess performance\nat lower levels across the\norganization; and specific\nforums exist to focus on key\nareas that drive strategic\nrisk such as balance sheet\nmanagement, the introduction\nof new or modified products\nand services and country\nmanagement, among others. In\naddition to these day-to-day\npractices, significant\nstrategic actions, such as\nmergers, acquisitions or\ncapital expenditures, are\nreviewed and approved by, or\nnotified to, the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  U.K.\u2019s Future Relationship with the EU                        \n                                                                \nAs previously disclosed, the\nU.K. formally left the\nEuropean Union (EU) on January\n31, 2020. Subsequently, the\nU.K. and the EU entered into a\nTrade and Cooperation\nAgreement (TCA) that set out\npreferential arrangements in\nareas such as trade in goods\nand in services that became\neffective on January 1, 2021.\nWhile entering into the TCA\navoided a \u201cno deal\u201d exit\nscenario, many questions\nremain as to the future\nrelationship between the U.K.\nand the EU. For example, the\nTCA minimally covers financial\nservices. The U.K. and the EU\nhave committed under the TCA\nto negotiate further details\nregarding financial services,\nbut there can be no assurance\nas to the successful\ncompletion or ultimate outcome\nof those negotiations. Citi\nplanned extensively for the\nU.K. exit from\n                              117                               \nthe EU and successfully\nimplemented its transition\nplans to date. However, future\nlegislative and regulatory\ndevelopments in the U.K. and\nthe EU as a result of the exit\nmay negatively impact Citi.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisks\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  LIBOR Transition Risk                                         \n                                                                \nThe ICE Benchmark\nAdministration concluded the\nconsultation on its intent to\ncease publication of one week\nand two month USD LIBOR on\nDecember 31, 2021 and to\nextend the publication of all\nremaining USD LIBORs until\nJune 30, 2023 for legacy\ncontracts.

Citi\nrecognizes that a transition\naway from and discontinuance\nof LIBOR presents various\nrisks and challenges that\ncould significantly impact\nfinancial markets and market\nparticipants, including Citi\n(for information about Citi\u2019s\nrisks from a transition away\nfrom and discontinuation of\nLIBOR or any other interest\nrate benchmark, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nabove). Accordingly, Citi has\ncontinued its efforts to\nidentify and manage its LIBOR\ntransition risks. Citi is also\nclosely monitoring\nlegislative, regulatory and\nother developments related to\nLIBOR transition matters and\nrelief.\n\nCiti has established a LIBOR\ngovernance and implementation\nprogram focused on identifying\nand addressing the LIBOR\ntransition impacts to Citi\u2019s\nclients, operational\ncapabilities and legal and\nfinancial contracts, among\nothers. The program operates\nglobally across Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses and functions and\nincludes active involvement of\nsenior management, oversight\nby Citi\u2019s Asset & Liability\nCommittee and reporting to the\nRisk Management Committee of\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. As part of the\nprogram, Citi has continued to\nimplement its LIBOR transition\naction plans and associated\nroadmaps under the following\nkey workstreams: program\nmanagement; transition\nstrategy and risk management;\ncustomer management, including\ninternal communications and\ntraining, legal/contract\nmanagement and product\nmanagement; financial\nexposures and risk management;\nregulatory and industry\nengagement; operations and\ntechnology; and finance, risk,\ntax and treasury.\n\nDuring 2020, Citi continued to\nparticipate in a number of\nworking groups formed by\nglobal regulators, including\nthe Alternative Reference\nRates Committee (ARRC)\nconvened by the Federal\nReserve Board. These working\ngroups promote and advance\ndevelopment of alternative\nreference rates and seek to\nidentify and address potential\nchallenges from any transition\nto such rates. Citi also\ncontinued to engage with\nregulators, financial\naccounting bodies and others\non LIBOR transition matters.\n\nMoreover, Citi has continued\nto identify its LIBOR\ntransition exposures,\nincluding financial\ninstruments that do not\ncontain contract provisions\nthat adequately contemplate\nthe discontinuance of\nreference rates and that would\nrequire additional negotiation\nwith counterparties. Citi\u2019s\nLIBOR transition efforts\ninclude, among other things,\nusing alternative reference\nrates in certain newly issued\nfinancial instruments and\nproducts. Since 2019, Citi has\nissued preferred stock and\nbenchmark debt referencing the\nSecured Overnight Financing\nRate (SOFR) as well as updated\nthe LIBOR determination method\nin its debt documentation with\nthe ARRC\n\nrecommended fallback language.\nIn addition, in 2020, Citi\ntransitioned the discounting\nof centrally cleared EUR and\nUSD interest rate derivatives\nto the Euro Short-Term Rate\n(ESTR) and SOFR, respectively;\nannounced the adoption of the\nnewly published Interbank\nOffered Rate (IBOR) Fallbacks\nProtocol of the International\nSwaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (ISDA) for\nexisting IBOR derivatives\ntransactions; and increased\nCiti\u2019s virtual client\ncommunication efforts,\nincluding outreach regarding\nthese new industry-led\nprotocols and solutions.\nFurther, Citi has also been\ninvesting in its systems and\ninfrastructure, as client\nactivity moves away from LIBOR\nto alternative reference\nrates.\n                                                                \n  Climate Risk                                                  \n                                                                \nClimate change presents\nimmediate and long-term risks\nto Citi and to its clients and\ncustomers, with the risks\nexpected to increase over\ntime. Climate risk refers to\nthe risk of loss arising from\nclimate change and is divided\ninto physical risk and\ntransition risk. Physical risk\nconsiders how chronic and\nacute climate change (e.g.,\nincreased storms, drought,\nfires, floods) can directly\ndamage physical assets (e.g.,\nreal estate, crops) or\notherwise impact their value\nor productivity. Transition\nrisk considers how changes in\npolicy, technology and market\npreference to address climate\nchange (e.g., carbon price\npolicies, power generation\nshifts from fossil fuels to\nrenewable energy) can lead to\nchanges in the value of\nassets, commodities and\ncompanies.\n\nClimate risk is an overarching\nrisk that can act as a driver\nof other types of risk in the\nCiti risk taxonomy, such as\ncredit risk from obligors\nexposed to high climate risk,\nreputational risk from\nincreased stakeholder concerns\nabout financing high carbon\nindustries and operational\nrisk from physical climate\nrisks to Citi\u2019s facilities.\n\nCiti currently identifies\nclimate risk as an \u201cemerging\nrisk\u201d within its risk\ngovernance framework. Emerging\nrisks are risks or thematic\nissues that are either new to\nthe landscape, or in the case\nof climate risk, existing\nrisks that are rapidly\nchanging or evolving in an\nescalating fashion, which are\ndifficult to assess due to\nlimited data or other\nuncertainties. For additional\ninformation on climate risk,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisk\u201d above.\n\nWith the increased importance\nand focus on climate risk,\nCiti has continued to expand\nits governance of climate risk\nand integrate climate\nconsiderations into the\npriorities of Citigroup\u2019s\nBoard of Directors and senior\nmanagement. In particular,\nCiti has:\n\n\u2022 appointed a Chief\nSustainability Officer;\n\n\u2022 appointed a Head of Climate\nRisk to partner with the Head\nof Environmental and Social\nRisk Management to deliver a\nCompany-wide strategy\nconcerning climate risk;\n\n\u2022 formed a global, cross-\nfunctional senior-executive\nlevel Climate Risk Advisory\nCouncil to provide oversight\nof and guidance to Citi\u2019s\nclimate risk integration\nefforts; and\n\n\u2022 increased the frequency and\ndepth of Board and senior-\nlevel review of climate-\nrelated matters.\n\nCiti manages and mitigates the\ncredit and reputational risks\nfrom climate change through a\nnumber of internal\ninitiatives, including Citi\u2019s\nEnvironmental and Social Risk\n                              118                               \nManagement (ESRM) Policy.\nFirst established in 2003, the\nESRM Policy is part of Citi\u2019s\nbroader credit risk management\npolicy and is applicable to\nall Citi entities globally.\nThe ESRM Policy provides the\nframework for how Citi\nidentifies, mitigates and\nmanages the potential\nenvironmental and social risks\n(including climate risks)\nassociated with clients\u2019\nactivities that could lead to\ncredit or reputation risks to\nthe Company. It guides how\nCiti evaluates lending,\nunderwriting and advisory in\nenvironmentally sensitive\nand/or high-carbon sectors,\nand presents opportunities for\nCiti to engage clients on\nsolutions to thematic risks.\n\nIn project-related lending,\nCiti\u2019s ESRM Policy\nincorporates the updates from\nthe fourth iteration of the\nEquator Principles, which Citi\nhelped shape, that expands\nclimate risk requirements to\ninclude physical risk as well\nas transition risk. Citi\u2019s\nESRM Policy covers lending and\nunderwriting with identified\nuse of proceeds directed to\nphysical assets and\nactivities, as well as sector\nstandards for corporate\nrelationships in higher-risk\nsectors, including carbon-\nintensive sectors. In 2020,\nCiti updated its sector\nstandards for thermal and coal\nmining, coal-fired power and\nArctic oil and gas.\n\nCiti has also made climate\nrisk one of the three key\npillars of its 2025\nSustainable Progress Strategy.\nUnder this pillar, Citi\nintends to measure, manage and\nreduce the climate risk and\nimpact of its client\nportfolios and enhance its\nTaskforce on Climate-Related\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD)\nimplementation and disclosure\nthrough policy development,\nportfolio analysis and client\nengagement. In December 2020,\nCiti released its second\nreport detailing its\nimplementation of the TCFD\nrecommendations: Finance for a\nClimate-Resilient Future II.\nIn this report, Citi discusses\nits implementation of the TCFD\nrecommendations, and Citi\u2019s\nrecent pilot testing of\nclimate scenario analyses to\nassess climate-related impacts\nand risks in specific sectors,\nspanning both transition and\nphysical climate risks.\nClimate data is still\nimproving in terms of its\naccessibility and reliability,\nand the industry and Citi\ncontinue to develop better\nmethodological approaches\ntoward assessing climate\nchange impacts. Nonetheless,\nCiti expects to integrate more\nquantitative analysis of\nclimate risks into credit\nassessments in the future and\nto quantify the carbon\nemissions associated with its\nclient portfolios. Citi will\ncontinue to disclose its\nprogress in this area in its\nannual Environmental, Social,\nand Governance (ESG) Report\nand TCFD reporting.\n\nIn addition, Citi continues to\nparticipate in financial\nindustry collaborations to\ndevelop and pilot new\nmethodologies and approaches\nfor measuring and assessing\nthe potential financial risks\nof climate change. Citi is\nalso closely monitoring\nregulatory developments on\nclimate risk and sustainable\nfinance, and actively engaging\nwith regulators on these\ntopics.\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nenvironmental and social\npolicies and priorities, see\nCiti\u2019s website at\nwww.citigroup.com.

For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries, most\nsignificantly in the United\nKingdom (U.K.) and Ireland,\n\nin order to more efficiently\nserve its corporate customers.\nAs an example, with respect to\nthe U.K., only 37% of\ncorporate loans presented in\nthe table below are to U.K.\ndomiciled entities (42% for\nunfunded commitments), with\nthe balance of the loans\npredominately to European\ndomiciled counterparties.\nApproximately 80% of the total\nU.K. funded loans and 86% of\nthe total U.K. unfunded\ncommitments were investment\ngrade as of December 31, 2020.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

As of\nDecember 31, 2020, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.0 billion. Citi uses the\nU.S. dollar as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\nArgentina because the\nArgentine economy is\nconsidered highly inflationary\nunder U.S. GAAP.\n\nDuring August 2020, the\nArgentine government announced\nthe successful restructuring\nof almost all of its foreign\ncurrency debt issued under\nforeign law, for which it had\npreviously postponed principal\nand interest payments.\nHowever, during September\n2020, the Argentine government\ntightened its existing capital\nand currency controls, which\ncontinue to restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access U.S. dollars\nin Argentina and remit\nearnings from its Argentine\noperations. Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations is likely\n\nto increase as Citi generates\nnet income in its Argentine\n\nfranchise and its earnings are\nunable to be remitted.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of December\n31, 2020, the international\nNDF market had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\u2019s\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge nearly all of its\nArgentine peso exposure. As a\nresult, and to the extent that\nCiti does not execute NDF\ncontracts for this unhedged\nexposure in the future, Citi\nwould record devaluations on\nits net Argentine\npeso\u2010denominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate\nallowances for credit losses\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\nsuch risks under U.S. GAAP as\nof December 31, 2020. However,\nU.S. regulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures. For additional\ninformation on emerging\nmarkets risks, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n\nFFIEC\u2014Cross-Border Claims on\nThird Parties and Local\nCountry Assets\n\nCiti\u2019s cross-border\ndisclosures are based on the\ncountry exposure bank\nregulatory reporting\nguidelines of the Federal\nFinancial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC).\nThe following summarizes some\nof the FFIEC key reporting\nguidelines:\n\n\u2022 Amounts are based on the\ndomicile of the ultimate\nobligor, counterparty,\ncollateral (only including\nqualifying liquid collateral),\nissuer or guarantor, as\napplicable (e.g., a security\nrecorded by a Citi U.S. entity\nbut issued by the U.K.\ngovernment is considered U.K.\nexposure; a loan recorded by a\nCiti Mexico entity to a\ncustomer domiciled in Mexico\nwhere the underlying\ncollateral is held in Germany\nis considered German\nexposure).\n\n\u2022 Amounts do not consider the\nbenefit of collateral received\nfor secured financing\ntransactions (i.e., repurchase\nagreements, reverse repurchase\nagreements and securities\nloaned and borrowed) and are\nreported based on notional\namounts.\n\n\u2022 Netting of derivative\nreceivables and payables,\nreported at fair value, is\npermitted, but only under a\nlegally binding netting\nagreement with the same\nspecific counterparty, and\ndoes not include the benefit\nof margin received or hedges.\n\n\u2022 Credit default swaps (CDS)\nare included based on the\ngross notional amount sold and\npurchased and do not include\nany offsetting CDS on the same\nunderlying entity.\n\n\u2022 Loans are reported without\nthe benefit of hedges.\n\nGiven the requirements noted\nabove, Citi\u2019s FFIEC cross-\nborder exposures and total\noutstandings tend to\nfluctuate, in some cases\nsignificantly, from period to\nperiod. As an example, because\ntotal outstandings under FFIEC\nguidelines do not include the\nbenefit of margin or hedges,\nmarket volatility in interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates\nand credit spreads may cause\nsignificant fluctuations in\nthe level of total\noutstandings, all else being\nequal.\n                              121                               \nThe tables below show each country whose total outstandings\nexceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) Non-bank financial institutions.\n\n(2) Included in total outstanding.\n\n(3) Total outstanding includes cross-border claims on third\nparties, as well as local country assets.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements contains a summary\nof all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. These policies, as\nwell as estimates made by\nmanagement, are integral to\nthe presentation of Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition. While all\nof these policies require a\ncertain level of management\njudgment and estimates, this\nsection highlights and\ndiscusses the significant\naccounting policies that\nrequire management to make\nhighly difficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. Substantially all\nof\n\nthese assets and liabilities\nare reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a majority\nof which are carried at fair\nvalue. In addition, certain\nloans, short-term borrowings,\nlong-term debt and deposits,\nas well as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet\nto meet customer needs and to\nmanage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. These judgments have\nthe potential to impact the\nCompany\u2019s financial\nperformance for instruments\nwhere the changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in either\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nare recognized in earnings.\nWhere Citi does not intend to\nsell the security nor could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nthe portion of the loss\nrelated to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAdjudicating the temporary\nnature of fair value\nimpairments is also inherently\njudgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 1, 6, 24 and 25 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                                                                \n  Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                             \n                                                                \nCiti provides reserves for an\nestimate of current expected\ncredit losses in the funded\nloan portfolio and for\nunfunded lending commitments,\nstandby letters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees\n(excluding those that are\nperformance guarantees), on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet\nin Allowance for credit losses\non loans (ACLL) and Other\nliabilities , respectively. In\naddition, Citi provides\nallowances for an estimate of\ncurrent expected credit losses\nfor other financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost,\nincluding held-to-maturity\nsecurities, reverse repurchase\nagreements, securities\nborrowed, deposits with banks\nand other financial\nreceivables carried at\namortized cost (these\nallowances, together with the\nACLL, are referred to as the\nACL).\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. For the\nquantitative component, Citi\nuses a forward-looking base\nmacroeconomic forecast that is\ncomplemented by a qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent. As further\ndiscussed below, this\nqualitative component reflects\n(i) economic uncertainty\nrelated to an alternative\ndownside scenario, (ii) loss\nadjustments for concentration\nand collateral and (iii)\nspecific adjustments based on\nthe associated portfolio for\nestimating the ACL.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent based on (i) its\ninternal system of credit risk\nratings, (ii) its\ncomprehensive internal history\nand rating agency information\nregarding default rates and\nloss data, including internal\ndata on the severity of losses\nin the event of\n                              123                               \ndefault, and (iii) a\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast of future\nmacroeconomic conditions. For\nits consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit loss is determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nfor the borrowers\u2019 probability\nof default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables that inform the\nforecasts. For corporate\nportfolios, the loss\nlikelihood and loss severity\nmodels cover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand business segments that\ncontribute to the portfolios.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s\ndelinquency-managed portfolios\ncontaining smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans also\nprimarily use PD, LGD and EAD\nmodels to determine expected\ncredit losses and reserve\nbalances based on leading\ncredit indicators, including\nloan delinquencies and changes\nin portfolio size, as well as\nother current economic factors\nand credit trends, including\nhousing prices, unemployment\nand gross domestic product\n(GDP). This methodology is\napplied separately for each\nproduct within each geographic\nregion in which these\nportfolios exist, including\nthe U.S., Mexico and Asia .\nThis evaluation process is\nsubject to numerous estimates\nand judgments. The frequency\nof default, risk ratings, loss\nrecovery rates, size and\ndiversity of individual large\ncredits and ability of\nborrowers with foreign\ncurrency obligations to obtain\nthe foreign currency necessary\nfor orderly debt servicing,\namong other things, are all\ntaken into account. Changes in\nthese estimates could have a\ndirect impact on Citi\u2019s credit\ncosts and the allowance in any\nperiod. Qualitative Management\nAdjustment Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component\nconsiders, among other things,\nthe uncertainty of forward-\nlooking economic scenarios\nbased on the likelihood and\nseverity of a downside\nscenario, certain portfolio\ncharacteristics and\nconcentrations, collateral\ncoverage, model limitations,\nidiosyncratic events and other\nrelevant criteria under\nbanking supervisory guidance\nfor the ACL. In the current\nmacroeconomic environment, the\nqualitative management\nadjustment also reflects the\nuncertainty around the\nestimated impact of the\npandemic on credit loss\nestimates. 4Q20 Combined\nQuantitative and Qualitative\nComponents In the fourth\nquarter of 2020, Citi (i)\nreleased $0.2 billion of the\nACL for its consumer\nportfolios and (ii) released\n$1.3 billion of the ACL for\nits corporate portfolios,\nprimarily driven by an\nimprovement in the base\nmacroeconomic forecast. In the\nfourth quarter, the\nqualitative management\nadjustment component\nincorporated an alternative\ndownside scenario, reflecting\nmore adverse economic\nconditions and, subsequently a\nslower Real GDP recovery, at a\n15% likelihood. This\nqualitative management\nadjustment component\ncontributed to an increase in\nthe ACL of approximately $0.7\nbillion resulting in a total\nqualitative management\nadjustment of $3.8 billion and\nan overall ACL balance of\n$27.8 billion at December 31,\n2020. The extent of the\npandemic\u2019s ultimate impact on\nCiti\u2019s ACL will depend on,\namong other things, (i) how\nconsumers respond to the\ngovernment stimulus and\nassistance programs;\n\n(ii) the impact on\nunemployment; (iii) the timing\nand extent of the economic\nrecovery; (iv) the severity\nand duration of the resurgence\nof COVID-19; (v) the rate of\ndistribution and\nadministration of vaccines;\nand (vi) the extent of any\nmarket volatility. Citi\nbelieves its analysis of the\nACL reflects the forward view\nof the economic analysis as of\nDecember 31, 2020, based on\nits November 5, 2020 base\nmacroeconomic forecast.\nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nuses a multitude of variables\nin its base macroeconomic\nforecast as part of its\ncalculation of both the\nquantitative and qualitative\n(including the downside\nscenario) components of the\nACL, including both domestic\nand international variables\nfor its global portfolios and\nexposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. Real GDP rate represent\nthe key macroeconomic\nvariables that most\nsignificantly affect its\nestimate of its consumer and\ncorporate ACLs. The tables\nbelow show these macroeconomic\nvariables used in determining\nCiti\u2019s 1Q20, 2Q20, 3Q20 and\n4Q20 consumer and corporate\nACLs, comparing Citi\u2019s\nforecasted 1Q21, 3Q21 and 1Q22\nquarterly average U.S.\nunemployment rate and Citi\u2019s\nforecasted 2020, 2021 and 2022\nyear-over-year U.S. Real GDP\ngrowth rate:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            1Q21       3Q21       1Q22       13-quar\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          6.9  %     6.6  %     6.3  %         6.1  %  \n  at 1Q20                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          8.1        6.3        5.8            7.2     \n  at 2Q20                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          8.2        6.8        6.3            6.6     \n  at 3Q20                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          7.3        6.5        6.2            6.1     \n  at 4Q20                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking 13\nquarters in forecast horizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. Real GDP                  2020       2021       2022     \n  Citi forecast                  -1.3  %     1.5  %     1.9  %  \n  at 1Q20                                                       \n  Citi forecast                  -5.1        5.5        3.3     \n  at 2Q20                                                       \n  Citi forecast                  -5.1        3.3        2.8     \n  at 3Q20                                                       \n  Citi forecast                  -4.0        3.7        2.7     \n  at 4Q20                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the Real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level. Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 4Q20, the U.S. unemployment\nrate and Real GDP growth rate\nare expected to continue to\nimprove, as the U.S. moves\npast the peak of the pandemic-\nrelated health and economic\ncrisis. Consumer As discussed\nabove, Citi\u2019s total consumer\nACL release (including\nCorporate/Other ) of $0.2\nbillion in the fourth quarter\nof 2020 reduced the ACL\nbalance to $19.6 billion, or\n6.77% of total consumer loans\nat December 31, 2020, and\nreflected the update of the\nbase macroeconomic forecast\nfor the fourth quarter, as\nwell as changes in loan\nvolumes. Citi\u2019s consumer ACL\nis largely driven by the cards\nbusinesses,\n                              124                               \nwhere the receivables have\nlonger estimated tenors under\nthe CECL lifetime expected\ncredit loss methodology, net\nof recoveries, than under the\nprevious incurred loss model.\n\nFor cards, including Citi\u2019s\ninternational businesses, the\nlevel of reserves relative to\nEOP loans decreased to 10.98%\nat December 31, 2020, compared\nto 11.42% at September 30,\n2020, primarily due to the\nupdate of the base\nmacroeconomic forecast for the\nfourth quarter of 2020. For\nthe remaining consumer\nexposures, the level of\nreserves relative to EOP loans\ndecreased slightly to 2.0% at\nDecember 31, 2020, compared to\n2.1% at September 30, 2020.\n\nCorporate\n\nCiti\u2019s corporate ACLL release\nof $1.6 billion in the fourth\nquarter of 2020 reduced the\nACLL reserve balance to $5.4\nbillion, or 1.42% of total\nfunded loans, and reflected\nthe update of the\nmacroeconomic forecast\nscenario for the fourth\nquarter, as well as fewer\ndowngrades in the portfolio.\n\nThe ACLUC build of $0.4\nbillion in the fourth quarter\nof 2020 increased the total\ncorporate ACLUC reserve\nbalance included in Other\nliabilities to $2.7 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt December 31, 2020, the\nratio of the ACLL to total\nfunded loans was 3.73% (6.77%\nfor consumer loans and 1.42%\nfor corporate loans), compared\nto 4.00% at September 30, 2020\n(6.96% for consumer loans and\n1.82% for corporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $5.7 billion at December\n31, 2020, up $394 million from\nSeptember 30, 2020. Consumer\nnon-accrual loans increased\n$451 million to $2.1 billion\nat December 31, 2020, from\n$1.7 billion at September 30,\n2020, while corporate non-\naccrual loans decreased $57\nmillion to $3.5 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020, from $3.6\nbillion at September 30, 2020.\nIn addition, the ratio of\ncorporate non-accrual loans to\ntotal corporate loans was\n0.91%, and the ratio of\nconsumer non-accrual loans to\ntotal consumer loans was\n0.74%, at December 31, 2020.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has elected to phase in\nthe CECL impact for regulatory\ncapital purposes. The\ntransition provisions were\nrecently modified to defer the\nphase-in. After two years with\nno impact on capital, the CECL\ntransition impact will phase\nin over a three-year\ntransition period with 25% of\nthe impact (net of deferred\ntaxes) recognized on the first\nday of each subsequent year,\ncommencing January 1, 2022,\nand will be fully implemented\non January 1, 2025. In\naddition, 25% of the build\n(pretax) made in 2020 and 2021\nwill be deferred and amortized\nover the same timeframe.\n\nFor a further description of\nthe ACL and related accounts,\nsee Notes 1 and 15 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor a discussion of the\nadoption of the CECL\naccounting pronouncement, see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually on July 1\n(the annual test) and through\ninterim assessments between\nannual tests if an event\noccurs or circumstances change\nthat would\n\nmore-likely-than-not reduce\nthe fair value of a reporting\nunit below its carrying\namount, such as a significant\nadverse change in the business\nclimate, a decision to sell or\ndispose of all or a\nsignificant portion of a\nreporting unit or a\nsignificant decline in Citi\u2019s\nstock price. During 2020, the\nannual test was performed,\nwhich resulted in no goodwill\nimpairment as described in\nNote 16 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020,\nCitigroup\u2019s activities are\nconducted through the Global\nConsumer Banking and\nInstitutional Clients Group\nbusiness segments and\nCorporate/Other . Goodwill\nimpairment testing is\nperformed at the level below\nthe business segment (referred\nto as a reporting unit).\n\nCiti utilizes allocated equity\nas a proxy for the carrying\nvalue of its reporting units\nfor purposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. The\nallocated equity in the\nreporting units is determined\nbased on the capital the\nbusiness would require if it\nwere operating as a standalone\nentity, incorporating\nsufficient capital to be in\ncompliance with both current\nand expected regulatory\ncapital requirements,\nincluding capital for\nspecifically identified\ngoodwill and intangible\nassets. The capital allocated\nto the businesses is\nincorporated into the annual\nbudget process, which is\napproved by Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors.\n\nGoodwill impairment testing\ninvolves management judgment,\nrequiring an assessment of\nwhether the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit can be\nsupported by the fair value of\nthe reporting unit using\nwidely accepted valuation\ntechniques, such as the market\napproach (earnings multiples\nand/or transaction multiples)\nand/or the income approach\n(discounted cash flow (DCF)\nmethod). In applying these\nmethodologies, Citi utilizes a\nnumber of factors, including\nactual operating results,\nfuture business plans,\neconomic projections and\nmarket data.\n\nSimilar to 2019, Citigroup\nengaged an independent\nvaluation specialist in 2020\nto assist in Citi\u2019s valuation\nfor all the reporting units\nwith goodwill balances,\nemploying both the market\napproach and the DCF method.\nThe resulting fair values were\nrelatively consistent and\nappropriate weighting was\ngiven to outputs from both\nmethods.\n\nUnder the market approach and\nin calculation of the terminal\nvalue under the income\napproach, the key assumptions\nare the selected price to\nearnings and price to tangible\nbook value multiples. The\nselection of the multiples\nconsiders the operating\nperformance and financial\ncondition of the reporting\nunits as compared with those\nof a group of selected\npublicly traded guideline\ncompanies. Among other\nfactors, the level and\nexpected growth in return on\ntangible equity relative to\nthose of the guideline\ncompanies is considered. Since\nthe guideline company prices\nused are on a minority\ninterest basis, the selection\nof the multiples considers\nrecent transactions prices, as\nwell as data in comparable\nmacroeconomic environments,\nwhich reflect control rights\nand privileges, in arriving at\na multiple that reflects an\nappropriate control premium.\n\nFor valuation under the income\napproach, the key assumptions\nused are the cash flows for\nthe forecasted period, the\nterminal growth rate and the\ndiscount rate. The cash flows\nfor the forecasted period are\nestimated based on\nmanagement\u2019s most recent\nprojections available as of\nthe testing date, given\n                              125                               \nconsideration to minimum\nequity capital requirement.\nThe projections incorporate\nmacroeconomic variables\ndeveloped at the same time.\nThe terminal growth rate is\nselected based on management\u2019s\nlong-term expectation for the\nbusinesses. The discount rate\nis based on the reporting\nunit\u2019s estimated cost of\nequity capital computed under\nthe capital asset pricing\nmodel and reflects the risk\nand uncertainty in the\nfinancial markets in the\ninternally generated cash flow\nprojections.\n\nSince none of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units are publicly\ntraded, individual reporting\nunit fair value determinations\ncannot be directly correlated\nto Citigroup\u2019s common stock\nprice. The sum of the fair\nvalues of the reporting units\nexceeded the overall market\ncapitalization of Citi as of\nJuly 1, 2020. However, Citi\nbelieves that it is not\nmeaningful to reconcile the\nsum of the fair values of the\nCompany\u2019s reporting units to\nits market capitalization due\nto several factors. The market\ncapitalization of Citigroup\nreflects the execution risk in\na transaction involving\nCitigroup due to its size.\nHowever, the individual\nreporting units\u2019 fair values\nare not subject to the same\nlevel of execution risk nor a\nbusiness model that is\nperceived to be as complex. In\naddition, the market\ncapitalization of Citigroup\ndoes not include consideration\nof the individual reporting\nunit\u2019s control premium.\n\nAt July 1, 2020, the fair\nvalues of Citi\u2019s reporting\nunits as a percentage of their\ncarrying values ranged from\napproximately 115% to 136%,\nresulting in no impairment.\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, the current\nenvironment continues to\nevolve due to the challenge\nand uncertainties related to\nthe pandemic. Further\ndeterioration in macroeconomic\nand market conditions,\nincluding potential adverse\neffects to economic forecasts\ndue to the severity and\nduration of the pandemic, as\nwell as the responses of\ngovernments, customers and\nclients, could negatively\ninfluence the assumptions used\nin the valuations, in\nparticular, the discount\nrates, exit multiples and\ngrowth rates used in net\nincome projections. If the\nfuture were to differ from\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of\nkey assumptions (e.g., net\ninterest revenue and loan\nvolume), and associated cash\nflows were to decrease, Citi\ncould potentially experience\nmaterial goodwill impairment\ncharges in the future.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 16 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for additional\ninformation on goodwill,\nincluding the changes in the\ngoodwill balance year-over-\nyear and the segments\u2019\ngoodwill balances as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n                                                                \n  Income Taxes                                                  \n                                                                \nOverview\n\nCiti is subject to the income\ntax laws of the U.S., its\nstates and local\nmunicipalities and the\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions in\nwhich Citi operates. These tax\nlaws are complex and are\nsubject to differing\ninterpretations by the\ntaxpayer and the relevant\ngovernmental taxing\nauthorities. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax\nlaws may be subject to review\nand adjudication by the court\nsystems of the various tax\njurisdictions or may be\nsettled with the taxing\nauthority upon audit.\n\nIn establishing a provision\nfor income tax expense, Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication\n\nof these inherently complex\ntax laws. Citi must also make\nestimates about when in the\nfuture certain items will\naffect taxable income in the\nvarious tax jurisdictions,\nboth domestic and foreign.\nDeferred taxes are recorded\nfor the future consequences of\nevents that have been\nrecognized in the financial\nstatements or tax returns,\nbased upon enacted tax laws\nand rates. Deferred tax assets\n(DTAs) are recognized subject\nto management\u2019s judgment that\nrealization is more-likely-\nthan-not. For example, if it\nis more-likely-than-not that a\ncarry-forward would expire\nunused, Citi would set up a\nvaluation allowance against\nthat DTA. Citi has established\nvaluation allowances as\ndescribed below.\n\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act (Tax Reform),\nbeginning in 2018, Citi is\ntaxed on income generated by\nits U.S. operations at a\nfederal tax rate of 21%. The\neffect on Citi\u2019s state tax\nrate is dependent upon how and\nwhen the individual states\nthat have not yet addressed\nthe federal tax law changes\nchoose to adopt the various\nnew provisions of the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code.\n\nCiti\u2019s non-U.S. branches and\nsubsidiaries are subject to\ntax at their local tax rates.\nNon-U.S. branches also\ncontinue to be subject to U.S.\ntaxation. The impact of this\non Citi\u2019s earnings depends on\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate and allocations of\noverall domestic loss (ODL)\nand expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to branch earnings.\nCiti expects no residual U.S.\ntax on such earnings since it\ncurrently has sufficient\nbranch tax carry-forwards.\nWith respect to non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries, dividends from\nthese subsidiaries will be\nexcluded from U.S. taxation.\nWhile the majority of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. subsidiary earnings\nare classified as Global\nIntangible Low Taxed Income\n(GILTI), Citi expects no\nmaterial residual U.S. tax on\nsuch earnings based on its\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 local\ntax rates, which exceed, on\naverage, the GILTI tax rate.\nFinally, Citi does not expect\nthe Base Erosion Anti-Abuse\nTax (BEAT) to affect its tax\nprovision.\n                                                                \n  Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances                  \n                                                                \nAt December 31, 2020, Citi had\nnet DTAs of $24.8 billion,\nunchanged from September 30,\n2020. Citi\u2019s net DTAs\nincreased $1.7 billion from\n$23.1 billion at December 31,\n2019, primarily due to an\nincrease in the ACL and\nadoption impact of the CECL\nstandard, partially offset by\ngains in AOCI . Of Citi\u2019s\ntotal net DTAs of $24.8\nbillion as of December 31,\n2020, $9.5 billion, primarily\nrelated to tax carry-forwards,\nwas excluded in calculating\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital. Net\nDTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences are deducted from\nregulatory capital if in\nexcess of the 10%/15%\nlimitations (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d above). For the\nquarter and year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, Citi did\nnot have any such DTAs.\nAccordingly, the remaining\n$15.3 billion of net DTAs as\nof December 31, 2020 was not\ndeducted in calculating\nregulatory capital pursuant to\nBasel III standards, and was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder those rules.\n\nCiti\u2019s total valuation\nallowance (VA) at December 31,\n2020 was $5.2 billion, a\ndecrease of $1.3 billion from\n$6.5 billion at December 31,\n2019, primarily driven by\nusage of carry-forwards in the\nFTC branch basket. Citi\u2019s VA\nof $5.2 billion is composed of\n(i) $3.4 billion on its FTC\ncarry-forwards, (ii) $1.0\nbillion on its U.S. residual\nDTA related to\n                              126                               \nits non-U.S. branches, (iii)\n$0.6 billion on local non-U.S.\nDTAs and (iv) $0.2 billion on\nstate net operating loss and\ncapital loss carry-forwards.\n\nAs stated above with regard to\nthe impact of non-U.S.\nbranches on Citi\u2019s earnings,\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate and the allocations of\nODL and expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to the branch basket\nare also the main factors in\ndetermining the branch VA.\nCiti computed these factors\nfor 2020. While the COVID-19\npandemic reduced branch\nearnings, the allocated ODL\ndid not decline since a large\nportion of the pandemic losses\nwill not be recognizable for\nU.S. taxable income until a\nfuture period. In addition,\nlower than forecasted U.S.\ninterest rates resulted in a\nlower allocation of interest\nexpense to non-U.S. branches.\nThe combination of these\nfactors drove the VA release\nof $0.5 billion in Citi\u2019s\nfull-year effective tax rate.\nCiti also released $0.1\nbillion of branch basket VA in\nthe fourth quarter, with\nrespect to future years based\nupon Citi\u2019s operating plan and\nestimates of future branch\nbasket factors, as discussed\nabove.\n\nCiti\u2019s VA of $1.0 billion\nagainst FTC carry-forwards in\nits general basket declined\n$0.1 billion in 2020,\nprimarily due to expired FTCs.\nIn the general FTC basket,\nforeign source income, an\nimportant driver in the\nutilization of FTC carry-\nforwards for the current year\nand future years in the carry-\nforward period, has been\nreduced due to the compression\nin interest rate spreads.\nOverall U.S. taxable income,\nwhich impacts ODL usage and,\ncorrespondingly, the\nutilization of FTC carry-\nforwards is also lower because\nof the impacts of the\npandemic. Accordingly,\nmanagement has taken actions\nto increase future foreign\nsource income and U.S. taxable\nincome. These planning actions\ninclude geographic asset\nmovements, deferral of future\nFTC recognition and\ncapitalization of expenses for\ntax purposes, resulting in no\ntax provision change to Citi\u2019s\ngeneral basket VA in 2020. In\nlight of the pandemic, Citi\nwill continue to monitor its\nforecasts and mix of earnings,\nwhich could affect Citi\u2019s VA\nagainst FTC carry-forwards.\nCiti continues to look for\nadditional actions that are\nprudent and feasible, taking\ninto account client,\nregulatory and operational\nconsiderations. See Note 9 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nRecognized FTCs comprised\napproximately $4.4 billion of\nCiti\u2019s DTAs as of December 31,\n2020, compared to\napproximately $6.3 billion as\nof December 31, 2019. The\ndecrease was primarily due to\ncurrent-year usage. The FTC\ncarry-forward period\nrepresents the most time-\nsensitive component of Citi\u2019s\nDTAs.\n\nCiti had an overall domestic\nloss (ODL) of approximately\n$26 billion at December 31,\n2020, which allows Citi to\nelect a percentage between 50%\nand 100% of future years\u2019\ndomestic source income to be\nreclassified as foreign source\nincome. (See Note 9 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for a description\nof the ODL.)\n\nThe majority of Citi\u2019s U.S.\nfederal net operating loss\ncarry-forward and all of its\nNew York State and City net\noperating loss carry-forwards\nare subject to a carry-forward\nperiod of 20 years. This\nprovides enough time to fully\nutilize the net DTAs\npertaining to these existing\nnet operating loss carry-\nforwards. This is due to\nCiti\u2019s forecast of sufficient\nU.S. taxable income and the\ncontinued taxation of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income by New York\nState and City.\n\nAlthough realization is not\nassured, Citi believes that\nthe realization of its\nrecognized net DTAs of $24.8\nbillion at December 31, 2020\nis more-likely-than-not, based\non management\u2019s expectations\nas to future taxable income in\nthe jurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\navailable tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC\nTopic 740, Income Taxes ).\nCiti has concluded that it has\nthe necessary positive\nevidence to support the\nrealization of its net DTAs\nafter taking its valuation\nallowances into consideration.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s income taxes, including\nits income tax provision, tax\nassets and liabilities and a\ntabular summary of Citi\u2019s net\nDTAs balance as of December\n31, 2020 (including the FTCs\nand applicable expiration\ndates of the FTCs), see Note 9\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.

The new law was\ngenerally effective January 1,\n2018.\n\nCiti recorded a one-time, non-\ncash charge to continuing\noperations of $22.6 billion in\nthe fourth quarter of 2017,\ncomposed of (i) a $12.4\nbillion remeasurement due to\nthe reduction of the U.S.\ncorporate tax rate and the\nchange to a \u201cquasi-territorial\ntax system,\u201d (ii) a $7.9\nbillion valuation allowance\nagainst Citi\u2019s FTC carry-\nforwards and its U.S. residual\nDTAs related to its non-U.S.\nbranches and (iii) a $2.3\nbillion reduction in Citi\u2019s\nFTC carry-forwards related to\nthe deemed repatriation of\nundistributed earnings of\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries. Of this\none-time charge, $16.4 billion\nwas considered provisional\npursuant to Staff Accounting\nBulletin (SAB) 118.\n\nCiti completed its accounting\nfor Tax Reform under SAB 118\nduring the fourth quarter of\n2018 and recorded a one-time,\nnon-cash tax benefit of $94\nmillion in Corporate/Other ,\nrelated to amounts that were\nconsidered provisional\npursuant to SAB 118.\n                              127                               \nThe table below details the fourth quarter of 2018 changes to\nCiti\u2019s provisional impact from Tax Reform:\n                                                                \n  Provisional Impact of Tax Reform                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                            Provisional         SAB 118 impact  \n                                amounts              to fourth  \n  In billions of        included in the        quarter of 2018  \n  dollars                2017 Form 10-K          tax provision  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Quasi-territor\u2026    $              6.2    $               0.2  \n  tax system                                                    \n  Valuation                         7.9                   -1.2  \n  allowance                                                     \n  Deemed                            2.3                    0.9  \n  repatriation                                                  \n  Total of                                                      \n  provisional        $             16.4    $              -0.1  \n  items                                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  2017 Impact of Tax Reform                                     \n                                                                \nThe table below discloses the as-reported GAAP results for 2018\nand 2017, as well as the 2017 adjusted results excluding the\none-time 2017 impact of Tax Reform.

Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting is\ndesigned to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the\nreliability of its financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal reporting purposes in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that\n(i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that in reasonable\ndetail accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and\ndispositions of Citi\u2019s assets,\n(ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of\nfinancial statements in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles\nand that Citi\u2019s receipts and\nexpenditures are made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof Citi\u2019s management and\ndirectors and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse or disposition of Citi\u2019s\nassets that could have a\nmaterial effect on its\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect all\nmisstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nCiti\u2019s management assessed the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020 based on the\ncriteria set forth by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework\n(2013) . Based on this\nassessment, management\nbelieves that, as of December\n31, 2020, Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was effective. In\naddition, there were no\nchanges in Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting during the fiscal\nquarter ended December 31,\n2020 that materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n\nThe effectiveness of Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020 has been\naudited by KPMG LLP, Citi\u2019s\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in\ntheir report below, which\nexpressed an unqualified\nopinion on the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n                              130                               \n                                                                \n  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                    \n                                                                \nCertain statements in this\nForm 10-K, including but not\nlimited to statements included\nwithin the Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and\nResults of Operations, are\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the\nrules and regulations of the\nSEC.

We also have\naudited the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl \u2013 Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nIn our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements referred to above\npresent fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the\nfinancial position of the\nCompany as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, and the results\nof its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the years in\nthe three-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2020, in\nconformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Also in our\nopinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2020 based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl \u2013 Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nChange in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, the Company has\nchanged its method of\naccounting for the recognition\nand measurement of credit\nlosses as of January 1, 2020\ndue to the adoption of ASC\nTopic 326, Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is\nresponsible for these\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, for maintaining\neffective internal control\nover financial reporting, and\nfor its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting, included in the\naccompanying management's\nannual report on internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on\nthe Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and an\nopinion on the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting based on\nour audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in\naccordance with the standards\nof the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free\nof material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud,\nand whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was maintained in\nall material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included\nperforming procedures to\nassess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as\nevaluating the overall\npresentation of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audit of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing\nthe risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other\nprocedures as we considered\nnecessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that\nour audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our\nopinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting is a\nprocess designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal purposes in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that,\nin reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit\npreparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of\nthe company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                              132                               \nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters\ncommunicated below are matters\narising from the current\nperiod audit of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements and (2) involved\nour especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex\njudgments. The communication\nof critical audit matters does\nnot alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as\na whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical\naudit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\n\nAssessment of the fair value\nof Level 3 assets and\nliabilities measured on a\nrecurring basis\n\nAs described in Notes 1, 24\nand 25 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis\nwere $918.1 billion and\n$308.8. billion, respectively\nat December 31, 2020. The\nCompany estimated the fair\nvalue of Level 3 assets and\nliabilities measured on a\nrecurring basis ($16.1 billion\nand $36.0 billion,\nrespectively at December 31,\n2020) utilizing various\nvaluation techniques with one\nor more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers\nbeing unobservable including,\nbut not limited to, complex\ninternal valuation models,\nalternative pricing procedures\nor comparables analysis and\ndiscounted cash flows.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the measurement of fair\nvalue for Level 3 assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis as\na critical audit matter. A\nhigh degree of audit effort,\nincluding specialized skills\nand knowledge, and subjective\nand complex auditor judgment\nwas involved in the assessment\nof the Level 3 fair values due\nto measurement uncertainty.\nSpecifically, the assessment\nencompassed the evaluation of\nthe fair value methodology,\nincluding methods, models and\nsignificant assumptions and\ninputs used to estimate fair\nvalue. Significant assumptions\nand inputs include interest\nrate, price, yield, credit\nspread, volatilities,\ncorrelations and forward\nprices. The assessment also\nincluded an evaluation of the\nconceptual soundness and\nperformance of the valuation\nmodels.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We involved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in evaluating the\ndesign and testing the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s Level\n3 fair value measurements\nincluding controls over:\n\n\u2022 valuation methodologies,\nincluding significant inputs\nand assumptions\n\n\u2022 independent price\nverification\n\n\u2022 evaluating that significant\nmodel assumptions and inputs\nreflected those which a market\nparticipant would use to\ndetermine an exit price in the\ncurrent market environment\n\n\u2022 the valuation models used\nwere mathematically accurate\nand appropriate to value the\nfinancial instruments\n\n\u2022 relevant information used\nwithin the Company\u2019s models\nthat was reasonably available\nwas considered in the fair\nvalue determination.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nmethodology for compliance\nwith U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles. We\ninvolved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in developing an\nindependent fair value\nestimate for a selection of\ncertain Level 3 assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis\nbased on independently\ndeveloped valuation models and\nassumptions, as applicable,\nusing market data sources we\ndetermined to be relevant and\nreliable and compared our\nindependent expectation to the\nCompany\u2019s fair value\nmeasurements.\n\nAssessment of the allowance\nfor credit losses collectively\nevaluated for impairment\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, the Company\nadopted ASU No. 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit\nLosses (ASC 326) as of January\n1, 2020. As discussed in Notes\n1 and 15 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses related to loans and\nunfunded lending commitments\ncollectively evaluated for\nimpairment (the collective\nACLL) was $27.6 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020. The\nexpected credit losses for the\nquantitative component of the\ncollective ACLL is the product\nof multiplying the probability\nof default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD), and exposure at\ndefault (EAD) for consumer and\ncorporate loans. For consumer\ncredit cards, the Company uses\nthe payment rate approach over\nthe life of the loan, which\nleverages payment rate curves,\nto determine the payments that\nshould be applied to liquidate\nthe end-of-period balance in\nthe estimation of EAD. For\nunconditionally cancelable\naccounts, reserves are based\non the expected life of the\nbalance as of the evaluation\ndate and do not include any\nundrawn commitments that are\nunconditionally cancelable.\nThe Company\u2019s models utilize a\nsingle forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast and\nmacroeconomic assumptions over\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast periods. Reasonable\nand supportable forecast\nperiods vary by product. For\nconsumer loan models, the\nCompany uses a 13-quarter\nreasonable and supportable\nperiod and reverts to\nhistorical loss experience\nthereafter. For corporate loan\nmodels, the Company uses a\nnine-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period followed by\na three-quarter transition to\nhistorical loss experience.\nAdditionally, for consumer\nloans, these models consider\nleading credit indicators\nincluding loan delinquencies,\nas well as economic factors.\nFor corporate loans, these\nmodels consider the credit\nquality as measured by risk\nratings and economic factors.\nThe qualitative component\nconsiders idiosyncratic events\nand the uncertainty of\nforward-looking economic\nscenarios.\n                              133                               \nWe identified the assessment\nof the collective ACLL as a\ncritical audit matter. The\nassessment involved\nsignificant measurement\nuncertainty requiring complex\nauditor judgment, and\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge as well as\nexperience in the industry.\nThis assessment encompassed\nthe evaluation of the various\ncomponents of the collective\nACLL methodology, including\nthe methods and models used to\nestimate the PD, LGD, and EAD\nand certain key assumptions\nand inputs for the Company\u2019s\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Key assumptions\nand inputs for consumer loans\nincluded loan delinquencies,\ncertain credit indicators,\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast periods, expected\nlife as well as economic\nfactors, including\nunemployment rates, gross\ndomestic product (GDP), and\nhousing prices which are\nconsidered in the model. For\ncorporate loans, key\nassumptions and inputs\nincluded risk ratings,\nreasonable and supportable\nforecasts, credit conversion\nfactor for unfunded lending\ncommitments, and economic\nfactors, including GDP and\nunemployment rates considered\nin the model. Key assumptions\nand inputs for the qualitative\ncomponent included the\nlikelihood and severity of a\ndownside scenario and\nconsideration of uncertainties\ndue to idiosyncratic events as\na result of the COVID-19\npandemic. The assessment also\nincluded an evaluation of the\nconceptual soundness and\nperformance of the PD, LGD,\nand EAD models. In addition,\nauditor judgment was required\nto evaluate the sufficiency of\naudit evidence obtained.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s\nmeasurement of the collective\nACLL estimate, including\ncontrols over the:\n\n\u2022 approval of the collective\nACLL methodologies\n\n\u2022 determination of the key\nassumptions and inputs used to\nestimate the quantitative and\nqualitative components of the\ncollective ACLL\n\n\u2022 performance monitoring of\nthe PD, LGD, and EAD models.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nprocess to develop the\ncollective ACLL estimate by\ntesting certain sources of\ndata, factors and assumptions\nthat the Company used and\nconsidered the relevance and\nreliability of such data,\nfactors, and assumptions. In\naddition, we involved credit\nrisk professionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n\n\u2022 reviewing the Company\u2019s\ncollective ACLL methodologies\nand key assumptions for\ncompliance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n\n\u2022 evaluating judgments made by\nthe Company relative to the\ndevelopment and performance\nmonitoring testing of the PD,\nLGD, and EAD models by\ncomparing them to relevant\nCompany-specific metrics\n\n\u2022 assessing the conceptual\nsoundness and performance\ntesting of the PD, LGD, and\nEAD models by\n\ninspecting the model\ndocumentation to determine\nwhether the models are\nsuitable for their intended\nuse\n\n\u2022 assessing the economic\nforecast scenarios through\ncomparison to publicly\navailable forecasts\n\n\u2022 evaluating the methodology\nused to develop certain\neconomic forecast scenarios by\ncomparing it to relevant\nindustry practices\n\n\u2022 testing corporate loan risk\nratings for a selection of\nborrowers by evaluating the\nfinancial performance of the\nborrower, sources of\nrepayment, and any relevant\nguarantees or underlying\ncollateral\n\n\u2022 evaluating the methodology\nused in determining the\nqualitative components and the\neffect of that component on\nthe collective ACLL compared\nwith relevant credit risk\nfactors and consistency with\ncredit trends.\n\nWe also assessed the\nsufficiency of the audit\nevidence obtained related to\nthe collective ACLL by\nevaluating the:\n\n\u2022 cumulative results of the\naudit procedures\n\n\u2022 qualitative aspects of the\nCompany\u2019s accounting practices\n\n\u2022 potential bias in the\naccounting estimates.\n\nAssessment of the\nrealizability of deferred tax\nassets, specifically as it\nrelates to general basket\nforeign tax credits\n\nAs discussed in Note 9 to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, the Company\u2019s net\ndeferred tax assets (DTA) were\n$31.0 billion as of December\n31, 2020. This balance is net\nof a valuation allowance of\n$5.2 billion recorded by the\nCompany. The estimation of the\nDTA for general basket foreign\ntax credits (FTCs) and related\nvaluation allowance was $5.3\nbillion and $1.0 billion\nrespectively. The Company\nevaluated the realization of\nthe DTA for general basket\nFTCs to determine whether\nthere was more than a 50%\nlikelihood that the DTA for\ngeneral basket FTCs would be\nrealized, based primarily on\nthe Company\u2019s expectations of\nfuture taxable income in each\nrelevant jurisdiction,\navailable tax planning\nstrategies and timing of tax\ncredit expirations. In\nparticular, the COVID-19\npandemic has negatively\naffected the economy and\nbusiness activities in\ncountries where the Company\noperates, which has impacted\nthe Company\u2019s future forecasts\nof taxable income as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the realizability of the\nDTA for general basket FTCs as\na critical audit matter. Due\nto the significant measurement\nuncertainty associated with\nthe realizability of the DTA\nfor general basket FTCs, there\nwas a high degree of\nsubjectivity and judgment in\nevaluating global tax\nregulations and future taxable\nincome. This assessment\nencompassed the evaluation of\nthe Company\u2019s estimations that\nare subjective and complex due\nto its global structure, given\nthe Company\u2019s assumptions used\nto determine that sufficient\ntaxable income will be\ngenerated or tax planning\nstrategies implemented to\nsupport the realization\n                              134                               \nof the DTA for general basket\nFTCs before expiration of\nforeign tax credits.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain controls related to\nthe Company\u2019s DTA\nrealizability process,\nincluding controls over the:\n\n\u2022 realizability of the\nCompany\u2019s deferred tax assets\nfor general basket FTCs\n\n\u2022 appropriateness of future\ntaxable income and tax\nplanning strategies.\n\nWe tested the Company\u2019s\nprocess to develop the\nvaluation allowance estimate.\nThis included performing an\nassessment of the policy and\nmethodology used by management\nin the valuation allowance\ndetermination. We involved\nincome tax professionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in\nassessing:\n\n\u2022 certain assumptions used to\ndetermine the Company\u2019s future\ntaxable income, including the\ninterpretation of the various\ntax laws and regulations and\nthe source and character of\nfuture taxable income\n\n\u2022 the timing of tax credit\nexpirations\n\n\u2022 the prudence and feasibility\nof certain tax planning\nstrategies.\n\nWe performed sensitivity\nanalyses over the Company\u2019s\nexpectations of future taxable\nincome and timing of tax\ncredit expirations.\n\nEvaluation of goodwill in the\nNorth American and Asia Global\nConsumer Banking reporting\nunits\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 16\nto the consolidated financial\nstatements, the goodwill\nbalance as of December 31,\n2020 was $22.2 billion, of\nwhich $12.1 billion related to\nreporting units within the\nGlobal Consumer Banking\nsegment and $10.1 billion\nrelated to reporting units\nwithin the Institutional\nClients Group segment. The\nCompany performs goodwill\nimpairment testing on an\nannual basis and whenever\nevents or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that\nthe carrying value of a\nreporting unit likely exceeds\nits fair value. This involves\nestimating the fair value of\nthe reporting units using both\ndiscounted cash flow analyses\nand a market multiples\napproach. The COVID-19\npandemic has negatively\naffected the economy and\nbusiness activities in\ncountries where the Company\noperates, which impacted the\nCompany\u2019s future forecasts\nused in the discounted cash\nflow analyses.\n\nWe identified the evaluation\nof the goodwill impairment\nanalysis for the North America\nGlobal Consumer Banking and\nAsia Global Consumer Banking\nreporting units, two of the\nthree reporting units within\nthe Global Consumer Banking\nsegment, as a critical audit\nmatter. The estimated fair\nvalue of the North America and\nAsia Global Consumer Banking\nreporting units marginally\nexceeded their carrying\nvalues, indicating a higher\nrisk due to measurement\nuncertainty that the goodwill\nmay be impaired and,\ntherefore, involved a high\ndegree of subjective auditor\njudgment. Specifically, the\nassessment encompassed the\nevaluation of the key\nassumptions used in estimating\nthe fair value of the North\nAmerica and Asia Global\nConsumer Banking reporting\nunits, which include the long-\nterm growth rate, discount\nrate, exit multiple\nassumptions, certain\nforecasted macroeconomic\nassumptions used to inform the\nforecasted income by reporting\nunit, and certain assumptions\nused to forecast income by\nreporting unit including the\nforecast period, net interest\nrevenue, and loan volume used\nin the discounted cash flow\nanalyses.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s\ndetermination of the estimated\nfair value of the North\nAmerica Global Consumer\nBanking and Asia Global\nConsumer Banking reporting\nunits, including controls\nrelated to management\u2019s\nprocess for assessing the\nappropriateness of:\n\n\u2022 certain assumptions\nincluding the long-term growth\nrate, discount rate and exit\nmultiple used in the\ndiscounted cash flow analyses\n\n\u2022 certain forecasted\nmacroeconomic assumptions used\nto inform the forecasted\nincome by reporting unit\n\n\u2022 certain assumptions used to\nforecast income by reporting\nunit including the forecast\nperiod, net interest revenue\nand loan volume.\n                              135                               \nWe compared the Company\u2019s\nhistorical revenue forecasts\nto actual results to assess\nthe Company\u2019s ability to\naccurately forecast. We\nevaluated the reasonableness\nof the Company\u2019s forecasts by\ncomparing to analyst reports.\n\nIn addition, we involved a\nvaluation professional with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n\n\u2022 developing an independent\nrange of long-term growth rate\nassumptions by reviewing\npublicly available data for\nthe United States and Asian\nmarkets and comparable\nindustries and comparing it to\nthe Company\u2019s assumption\n\n\u2022 evaluating the discount rate\nby assessing the methodology\nused by management and\ndeveloping an independent\nassumption for the

(Citibank) is a\ncommercial bank and wholly\nowned subsidiary of Citigroup.\nCitibank\u2019s principal offerings\ninclude consumer finance,\nmortgage lending and retail\nbanking (including commercial\nbanking) products and\nservices; investment banking,\ncash management and trade\nfinance; and private banking\nproducts and services.\nVariable Interest Entities\n(VIEs) An entity is a variable\ninterest entity (VIE) if it\nmeets either of the criteria\noutlined in Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC)\nTopic 810, Consolidation ,\nwhich are (i) the entity has\nequity that is insufficient to\npermit the entity to finance\nits activities without\nadditional subordinated\nfinancial support from other\nparties, or (ii) the entity\nhas equity investors that\ncannot make significant\ndecisions about the entity\u2019s\noperations or that do not\nabsorb their proportionate\nshare of the entity\u2019s expected\nlosses or expected returns.\nThe Company consolidates a VIE\nwhen it has both the power to\ndirect the activities that\nmost significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and\na right to receive benefits or\nthe obligation to absorb\nlosses of the entity that\ncould be\n\npotentially significant to the\nVIE (that is, Citi is the\nprimary beneficiary). In\naddition to variable interests\nheld in consolidated VIEs, the\nCompany has variable interests\nin other VIEs that are not\nconsolidated because the\nCompany is not the primary\nbeneficiary. All\nunconsolidated VIEs are\nmonitored by the Company to\nassess whether any events have\noccurred to cause its primary\nbeneficiary status to change.\nAll entities not deemed to be\nVIEs with which the Company\nhas involvement are evaluated\nfor consolidation under other\nsubtopics of ASC 810.See Note\n21 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for more\ndetailed information. Foreign\nCurrency Translation Assets\nand liabilities of Citi\u2019s\nforeign operations are\ntranslated from their\nrespective functional\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars\nusing period-end spot foreign\nexchange rates. The effects of\nthose translation adjustments\nare reported in Accumulated\nother comprehensive income\n(loss) , a component of\nstockholders\u2019 equity, net of\nany related hedge and tax\neffects, until realized upon\nsale or substantial\nliquidation of the foreign\noperation, at which point such\namounts related to the foreign\nentity are reclassified into\nearnings. Revenues and\nexpenses of Citi\u2019s foreign\noperations are translated\nmonthly from their respective\nfunctional currencies into\nU.S. dollars at amounts that\napproximate weighted average\nexchange rates. For\ntransactions that are\ndenominated in a currency\nother than the functional\ncurrency, including\ntransactions denominated in\nthe local currencies of\nforeign operations that use\nthe U.S. dollar as their\nfunctional currency, the\neffects of changes in exchange\nrates are primarily included\nin Principal transactions ,\nalong with the related effects\nof any economic hedges.\nInstruments used to hedge\nforeign currency exposures\ninclude foreign currency\nforward, option and swap\ncontracts and, in certain\ninstances, designated issues\nof non-U.S. dollar debt.\nForeign operations in\ncountries with highly\ninflationary economies\ndesignate the U.S. dollar as\ntheir functional currency,\nwith the effects of changes in\nexchange rates primarily\nincluded in Other revenue .\nInvestment Securities\nInvestments include debt and\nequity securities. Debt\nsecurities include bonds,\nnotes and redeemable preferred\nstocks, as well as certain\nloan-backed and structured\nsecurities that are subject to\nprepayment risk. Equity\nsecurities include common and\nnonredeemable preferred stock.\nDebt Securities \u2022 Debt\nsecurities classified as\n\u201cheld-to-maturity\u201d are\nsecurities that the Company\nhas both the ability and the\nintent to hold until maturity\nand are carried at amortized\ncost. Interest income on such\nsecurities is included in\nInterest revenue . \u2022 Debt\nsecurities classified as\n\u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d are\ncarried at fair value with\nchanges in fair value reported\nin Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) ,\na\n                              146                               \ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, net of applicable income\ntaxes and hedges. Interest income on such securities is included\nin Interest revenue . Equity Securities \u2022 Marketable equity\nsecurities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecognized in earnings. \u2022 Non-marketable equity securities are\nmeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in\nearnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or\n(ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal\nHome Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to\nbe carried at cost. Non-marketable equity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are carried at cost plus or minus\nchanges resulting from observed prices for orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. \u2022\nCertain investments that would otherwise have been accounted for\nusing the equity method are carried at fair value with changes\nin fair value recognized in earnings, since the Company elected\nto apply fair value accounting. For investments in debt\nsecurities classified as HTM or AFS, the accrual of interest\nincome is suspended for investments that are in default or for\nwhich it is likely that future interest payments will not be\nmade as scheduled. Debt securities not measured at fair value\nthrough earnings include securities held in HTM or AFS, and\nequity securities accounted for under the Measurement\nAlternative or equity method. These securities are subject to\nevaluation for impairment as described in Note 15 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for HTM securities and in Note\n13 for AFS, Measurement Alternative and equity method\ninvestments. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments\nare included in earnings, primarily on a specific identification\nbasis. The Company uses a number of valuation techniques for\ninvestments carried at fair value, which are described in Note\n24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading Account\nAssets and Liabilities Trading account assets include debt and\nmarketable equity securities, derivatives in a receivable\nposition, residual interests in securitizations and physical\ncommodities inventory. In addition, as described in Note 25 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements, certain assets that\nCitigroup has elected to carry at fair value under the fair\nvalue option, such as loans and purchased guarantees, are also\nincluded in Trading account assets . Trading account liabilities\ninclude securities sold, not yet purchased (short positions) and\nderivatives in a net payable position, as well as certain\nliabilities that Citigroup has elected to carry at fair value\n(as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). Other than physical commodities inventory, all\ntrading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair\nvalue. Revenues generated from trading assets and trading\nliabilities are generally reported in Principal transactions and\ninclude realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains\nand losses resulting from changes in the fair value of such\ninstruments. Interest income on trading assets is recorded in\nInterest revenue reduced by interest expense on trading\nliabilities. Physical commodities inventory is carried at the\nlower of cost or market with related losses reported in\nPrincipal transactions . Realized gains and losses on sales of\ncommodities inventory are included in Principal transactions .\nInvestments in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold,\nsilver, platinum and palladium) are accounted for as hybrid\ninstruments containing a debt host contract and an embedded non-\nfinancial derivative instrument indexed to the price of the\nrelevant precious metal. The embedded derivative instrument is\nseparated from the debt host contract and accounted for at fair\nvalue. The debt host contract is carried at fair value under the\nfair value option, as described in Note 25 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Derivatives used for trading purposes\ninclude interest rate, currency, equity, credit and commodity\nswap agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and\nfinancial and commodity futures and forward contracts.\nDerivative asset and liability positions are presented net by\ncounterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when a valid\nmaster netting agreement exists and the other conditions set out\nin ASC Topic 210-20, Balance Sheet\u2014Offsetting , are met. See\nNote 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company\nuses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of\ntrading assets and liabilities, which are described in Note 24\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements. Securities Borrowed\nand Securities Loaned Securities borrowing and lending\ntransactions do not constitute a sale of the underlying\nsecurities for accounting purposes and are treated as\ncollateralized financing transactions. Such transactions are\nrecorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or received plus\naccrued interest. As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair\nvalue accounting to a number of securities borrowing and lending\ntransactions. Fees paid or received for all securities lending\nand borrowing transactions are recorded in Interest expense or\nInterest revenue at the contractually specified rate. The\nCompany monitors the fair value of securities borrowed or loaned\non a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in\norder to maintain contractual margin protection. As described in\nNote 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company\nuses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair\nvalue of securities lending and borrowing transactions.\nRepurchase and Resale Agreements Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase (repos) and securities purchased under\nagreements to resell (reverse repos) do not constitute a sale\n(or purchase) of the underlying securities for accounting\npurposes and are treated as collateralized financing\ntransactions. As described in Note 25 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, the Company has elected to apply fair\nvalue accounting to certain of such transactions, with changes\nin fair value reported in earnings. Any transactions for which\nfair value accounting has not been\n                              147                               \nelected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received\nplus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has\nelected fair value accounting, interest paid or received on all\nrepo and reverse repo transactions is recorded in Interest\nexpense or Interest revenue at the contractually specified rate.\nWhere the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance\nSheet\u2014Offsetting: Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements ,\nare met, repos and reverse repos are presented net on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. The Company\u2019s policy is to take\npossession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase\nagreements. The Company monitors the fair value of securities\nsubject to repurchase or resale on a daily basis and obtains or\nposts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection. As described in Note 24 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, the Company uses a discounted cash flow\ntechnique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo\ntransactions. Loans Loans are reported at their outstanding\nprincipal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized\ndeferred fees and costs, except for credit card receivable\nbalances, which include accrued interest and fees. Loan\norigination fees and certain direct origination costs are\ngenerally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over\nthe lives of the related loans. As described in Note 25 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements, Citi has elected fair value\naccounting for certain loans. Such loans are carried at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value reported in earnings. Interest\nincome on such loans is recorded in Interest revenue at the\ncontractually specified rate. Loans that are held-for-investment\nare classified as Loans, net of unearned income on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash flows are\nincluded within the cash flows from investing activities\ncategory in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the line\nChange in loans . However, when the initial intent for holding a\nloan has changed from held-for-investment to held-for-sale\n(HFS), the loan is reclassified to HFS, but the related cash\nflows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing\nactivities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the\nline Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans . Consumer\nLoans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed\nprimarily by the Global Consumer Banking (GCB) businesses and\nCorporate/Other . Consumer Non-accrual and Re-aging Policies As\na general rule, interest accrual ceases for installment and real\nestate (both open- and closed-end) loans when payments are\n90days contractually past due. For credit cards and other\nunsecured revolving loans, however, Citi generally accrues\ninterest until payments are 180days past due. As a result of OCC\nguidance, home equity loans in regulated bank entities are\nclassified as non-accrual if the related residential first\nmortgage is 90days or more past due. Also as a result of OCC\nguidance, mortgage loans in regulated bank entities are\nclassified as non-accrual within 60days of notification that the\nborrower has filed for bankruptcy, other than Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA)-insured loans. Loans that have been\nmodified to grant a concession to a borrower in financial\ndifficulty may not be accruing interest at the time of the\nmodification. The policy for returning such modified loans to\naccrual status varies by product and/or region. In most cases, a\nminimum number of payments (ranging from oneto six) is required,\nwhile in other cases the loan is never returned to accrual\nstatus. For regulated bank entities, such modified loans are\nreturned to accrual status if a credit evaluation at the time\nof, or subsequent to, the modification indicates the borrower is\nable to meet the restructured terms, and the borrower is current\nand has demonstrated a reasonable period of sustained payment\nperformance (minimum six monthsof consecutive payments). For\nU.S. consumer loans, generally one of the conditions to qualify\nfor modification (other than for loan modifications made through\nthe CARES Act relief provisions or banking agency guidance for\npandemic-related issues) is that a minimum number of payments\n(typically ranging from oneto three) must be made. Upon\nmodification, the loan is re-aged to current status. However,\nre-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer loans, such\nas credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer\nloans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for the\nloan to be re-aged to current status is that at least\nthreeconsecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent\namount, must be received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines,\nthe number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject\nto limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five\nyears). Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\nloans may only be modified under those respective agencies\u2019\nguidelines, and payments are not always required in order to re-\nage a modified loan to current. Consumer Charge-Off Policies\nCiti\u2019s charge-off policies follow the general guidelines below:\n\u2022 Unsecured installment loans are charged off at 120days\ncontractually past due. \u2022 Unsecured revolving loans and credit\ncard loans are charged off at 180days contractually past due. \u2022\nLoans secured with non-real estate collateral are written down\nto the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at\n120days contractually past due. \u2022 Real estate-secured loans are\nwritten down to the estimated value of the property, less costs\nto sell, at 180days contractually past due. \u2022 Real estate-\nsecured loans are charged off no later than 180days\ncontractually past due if a decision has been made not to\nforeclose on the loans. \u2022 Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are\ncharged off within 60days of notification of filing by the\nbankruptcy court or in accordance with Citi\u2019s charge-off policy,\nwhichever occurs earlier. \u2022 Real estate-secured loans in\nbankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans, are written down to\nthe estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, within\n60days of\n                              148                               \nnotification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or in\naccordance with Citi\u2019s charge-off policy, whichever is earlier.\nCorporate Loans Corporate loans represent loans and leases\nmanaged by Institutional Clients Group ( ICG ). Corporate loans\nare identified as impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual)\nbasis when it is determined, based on actual experience and a\nforward-looking assessment of the collectability of the loan in\nfull, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or\nwhen interest or principal is 90days past due, except when the\nloan is well collateralized and in the process of collection.\nAny interest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is\nreversed at 90days past due and charged against current\nearnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only\nto the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate collectability of principal, all cash\nreceipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded\ninvestment in the loan. Impaired corporate loans and leases are\nwritten down to the extent that principal is deemed to be\nuncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans and leases,\nwhere repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of\nthe underlying collateral and there are no other available and\nreliable sources of repayment, are written down to the lower of\ncarrying value or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are\nreturned to accrual status when all contractual principal and\ninterest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there\nis a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance\nwith the contractual terms. Loans Held-for-Sale Corporate and\nconsumer loans that have been identified for sale are classified\nas loans HFS and included in Other assets . The practice of\nCiti\u2019s U.S. prime mortgage business has been to sell\nsubstantially all of its conforming loans. As such, U.S. prime\nmortgage conforming loans are classified as HFS and the fair\nvalue option is elected at origination, with changes in fair\nvalue recorded in Other revenue . With the exception of those\nloans for which the fair value option has been elected, HFS\nloans are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value,\nwith any write-downs or subsequent recoveries charged to Other\nrevenue . The related cash flows are classified in the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the cash flows from\noperating activities category on the line Change in loans held-\nfor-sale . Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL) Commencing January\n1, 2020, Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASC) 326,\nFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses , using the methodologies\ndescribed below. For information about Citi\u2019s accounting for\nloan losses prior to January 1, 2020, see \u201cSuperseded Accounting\nPrinciples\u201d below. The current expected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology is based on relevant information about past events,\nincluding historical experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable (R&S) forecasts that affect the\ncollectability of the reported financial asset balances. If the\nasset\u2019s life extends beyond the R&S forecast period, then\nhistorical experience is considered over the remaining life of\nthe assets in the ACL. The resulting ACL is adjusted in each\nsubsequent reporting period through Provisions for credit losses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Income to reflect changes in\nhistory, current conditions and forecasts as well as changes in\nasset positions and portfolios. ASC 326 defines the ACL as a\nvaluation account that is deducted from the amortized cost of a\nfinancial asset to present the net amount that management\nexpects to collect on the financial asset over its expected\nlife. All financial assets carried at amortized cost are in the\nscope of ASC 326, while assets measured at fair value are\nexcluded. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor a discussion of impairment on available-for-sale (AFS)\nsecurities. Increases and decreases to the allowances are\nrecorded in Provisions for credit losses . The CECL methodology\nutilizes a lifetime expected credit loss (ECL) measurement\nobjective for the recognition of credit losses for held-for-\ninvestment (HFI) loans, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities,\nreceivables and other financial assets measured at amortized\ncost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired.\nWithin the life of a loan or other financial asset, the\nmethodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the\nprovision for credit losses and the related ACL than prior U.S.\nGAAP. Estimation of ECLs requires Citi to make assumptions\nregarding the likelihood and severity of credit loss events and\ntheir impact on expected cash flows, which drive the probability\nof default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD) models and, where Citi discounts the ECL, using\ndiscounting techniques for certain products. Where the asset\u2019s\nlife extends beyond the R&S forecast period, Citi considers\nhistorical experience over the remaining life of the assets in\nestimating the ACL. Citi uses a multitude of variables in its\nmacroeconomic forecast as part of its calculation of both the\nqualitative and quantitative components of the ACL, including\nboth domestic and international variables for its global\nportfolios and exposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of the U.S.\nunemployment rate and U.S. Real GDP growth rate represent the\nkey macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its\nestimate of its consumer and corporate ACLs. Under the\nquantitative base scenario, Citi\u2019s 4Q\u201920 forecasts are for U.S.\nunemployment to continue to improve as the U.S. moves past the\npeak of the health and economic crisis. The downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse economic conditions and subsequently\nhigher unemployment rates and slower GDP recovery. The following\nare the main factors and interpretations that Citi considers\nwhen estimating the ACL under the CECL methodology: \u2022 The most\nimportant reasons for the 2020 change in the ACL since the\nadoption of CECL on January 1, 2020 are the pandemic and the\nresulting economic recessions, which led to higher unemployment\nand lower GDP forecasts than were expected at the beginning of\nthe year; the impact of government stimulus and relief programs;\nand portfolio changes and lower loan balances resulting from\nchanged customer spending patterns.\n                              149                               \n\u2022 CECL reserves are estimated over the contractual term of the\nfinancial asset, which is adjusted for expected prepayments.\nExpected extensions are generally not considered unless the\noption to extend the loan cannot be canceled unilaterally by\nCiti. Modifications are also not considered, unless Citi has a\nreasonable expectation that it will execute a troubled debt\nrestructuring (TDR). \u2022 Credit enhancements that are not\nfreestanding (such as those that are included in the original\nterms of the contract or those executed in conjunction with the\nlending transaction) are considered loss mitigants for purposes\nof CECL reserve estimation. \u2022 For unconditionally cancelable\naccounts such as credit cards, reserves are based on the\nexpected life of the balance as of the evaluation date (assuming\nno further charges) and do not include any undrawn commitments\nthat are unconditionally cancelable. Reserves are included for\nundrawn commitments for accounts that are not unconditionally\ncancelable (such as letters of credit and corporate loan\ncommitments, HELOCs, undrawn mortgage loan commitments and\nfinancial guarantees). \u2022 CECL models are designed to be\neconomically sensitive. They utilize the macroeconomic forecasts\nprovided by Citi\u2019s economic forecasting team (EFT) that are\napproved by senior management. Analysis is performed and\ndocumented to determine the necessary qualitative management\nadjustment (QMA) to capture forward-looking macroeconomic\nexpectations and model uncertainty. \u2022 The portion of the\nforecast that reflects the EFT\u2019s reasonable and supportable\n(R&S) period indicates the maximum length of time its models can\nproduce a R&S macroeconomic forecast, after which mean reversion\nreflecting historical loss experience is used for the remaining\nlife of the loan to estimate expected credit losses. For the\nloss forecast, businesses consume the macroeconomic forecast as\ndetermined to be appropriate and justifiable. Citi\u2019s ability to\nforecast credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&S)\nperiod is based on the ability to forecast economic activity\nover a reasonable and supportable time window. The R&S period\nreflects the overall ability to have a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast of credit loss based on economic forecasts.\n\u2022 The loss models consume all or a portion of the R&S economic\nforecast and then revert to historical loss experience. The R&S\nforecast period for consumer loans is 13 quarters and, in most\ncases, reverts to historically based loss experience either\nimmediately or using a straight-line approach thereafter, while\nthe R&S period for wholesale is nine quarters with an additional\nstraight-line reversion period of three quarters for ECL\nparameters. \u2022 The ACL incorporates provisions for accrued\ninterest on products that are not subject to a non-accrual and\ntimely write-off policy (e.g., cards and Ready Credit, etc.). \u2022\nThe reserves for TDRs are calculated using the discounted cash\nflow method and consider appropriate macroeconomic forecast data\nfor the exposure type. For TDR loans that are collateral\ndependent, the ACL is based on the fair value of the collateral.\n\u2022 Citi uses the most recent available information to inform its\nmacroeconomic forecasts, allowing sufficient time for analysis\nof the results and corresponding approvals. Key variables are\nreviewed for significant changes through year end and changes to\nportfolio positions are reflected in the ACL. \u2022 Reserves are\ncalculated at an appropriately granular level and on a pooled\nbasis where financial assets share risk characteristics. At a\nminimum, reserves are calculated at a portfolio level (product\nand country). Where a financial asset does not share risk\ncharacteristics with any of the pools, it is evaluated for\ncredit losses individually. Quantitative and Qualitative\nComponents of the ACL The loss likelihood and severity models\nuse both internal and external information and are sensitive to\nforecasts of different macroeconomic conditions. For the\nquantitative component, Citi uses a single forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast, complemented by the qualitative\ncomponent that reflects economic uncertainty due to a different\npossible more adverse scenario for estimating the ACL. Estimates\nof these ECLs are based upon (i) Citigroup\u2019s internal system of\ncredit risk ratings; (ii) historical default and loss data,\nincluding comprehensive internal history and rating agency\ninformation regarding default rates and internal data on the\nseverity of losses in the event of default; and (iii) a R&S\nforecast of future macroeconomic conditions. ECL is determined\nprimarily by utilizing models for the borrowers\u2019 PD, LGD and\nEAD. Adjustments may be made to this data, including (i)\nstatistically calculated estimates to cover the historical\nfluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, the\nhistorical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans\nand the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations\nin the global portfolio, and (ii) adjustments made for\nspecifically known items, such as current environmental factors\nand credit trends. Any adjustments needed to the modeled\nexpected losses in the quantitative calculations are addressed\nthrough a qualitative adjustment. The qualitative adjustment\nconsiders, among other things: the uncertainty of forward-\nlooking scenarios based on the likelihood and severity of a\npossible recession; the uncertainty of economic conditions\nrelated to an alternative downside scenario; certain portfolio\ncharacteristics and concentrations; collateral coverage; model\nlimitations; idiosyncratic events; and other relevant criteria\nunder banking supervisory guidance for loan loss reserves. The\nqualitative adjustment also reflects the estimated impact of the\npandemic on the economic forecasts and the impact on credit loss\nestimates. The total ACL is composed of the quantitative and\nqualitative components. Consumer Loans For consumer loans, most\nportfolios including North America cards, mortgages and personal\ninstallment loans (PILs) are covered by the PD, LGD and EAD loss\nforecasting models.\n                              150                               \nSome smaller international portfolios are covered by econometric\nmodels where the gross credit loss (GCL) rate is forecasted. The\nmodeling of all retail products is performed by examining risk\ndrivers for a given portfolio; these drivers relate to exposures\nwith similar credit risk characteristics and consider past\nevents, current conditions and R&S forecasts. Under the PD x LGD\nx EAD approach, GCLs and recoveries are captured on an\nundiscounted basis. Citi incorporates expected recoveries on\nloans into its reserve estimate, including expected recoveries\non assets previously written off. CECL defines the exposure\u2019s\nexpected life as the remaining contractual maturity including\nany expected prepayments. Subsequent changes to the contractual\nterms that are the result of a re-underwriting are not included\nin the loan\u2019s expected CECL life. Citi does not establish\nreserves for the uncollectible accrued interest on non-revolving\nconsumer products, such as mortgages and installment loans,\nwhich are subject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy.\nAs such, only the principal balance is subject to the CECL\nreserve methodology and interest does not attract a further\nreserve. FAS 91-deferred origination costs and fees related to\nnew account originations are amortized within a 12-month period,\nand an ACL is provided for components in the scope of the ASC.\nSeparate valuation allowances are determined for impaired\nsmaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified\nin a TDR. Long-term modification programs, and short-term (less\nthan 12 months) modifications that provide concessions (such as\ninterest rate reductions) to borrowers in financial difficulty,\nare reported as TDRs. In addition, loan modifications that\ninvolve a trial period are reported as TDRs at the start of the\ntrial period. The ACL for TDRs is determined using a discounted\ncash flow (DCF) approach. When a DCF approach is used, the\ninitial allowance for ECLs is calculated as the expected\ncontractual cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s original\neffective interest rate. DCF techniques are applied only for\nconsumer loans classified as TDR loan exposures. For cards, Citi\nuses the payment rate approach, which leverages payment rate\ncurves, to determine the payments that should be applied to\nliquidate the end-of-period balance (CECL balance) in the\nestimation of EAD. The payment rate approach uses customer\npayment behavior (payment rate) to establish the portion of the\nCECL balance that will be paid each month. These payment rates\nare defined as the percentage of principal payments received in\nthe respective month divided by the prior month\u2019s billed\nprincipal balance. The liquidation (CECL payment) amount for\neach forecast period is determined by multiplying the CECL\nbalance by that period\u2019s forecasted payment rate. The cumulative\nsum of these payments less the CECL balance produces the balance\nliquidation curve. Citi does not apply a non-accrual policy to\ncredit card receivables; rather, they are subject to full\ncharge-off at 180 days past due. As such, the entire customer\nbalance up until write-off, including accrued interest and fees,\nwill be subject to the CECL reserve methodology. Corporate Loans\nand HTM Securities Citi records allowances for credit losses on\nall financial assets carried at amortized cost that are in the\nscope of CECL, including corporate loans classified as HFI and\nHTM debt securities. Discounting techniques are applied for\ncorporate loans classified as HFI and HTM securities and non-\naccrual/TDR loan exposures. All cash flows are fully discounted\nto the reporting date. The ACL includes Citi\u2019s estimate of all\ncredit losses expected to be incurred over the estimated full\ncontractual life of the financial asset. The contractual life of\nthe financial asset does not include expected extensions,\nrenewals or modifications, except for instances where the\nCompany reasonably expects to extend the tenor of the financial\nasset pursuant to a future TDR Where Citi has an unconditional\noption to extend the contractual term, Citi does not consider\nthe potential extension in determining the contractual term;\nhowever, where the borrower has the sole right to exercise the\nextension option without Citi\u2019s approval, Citi does consider the\npotential extension in determining the contractual term. The\ndecrease in credit losses under CECL at the date of adoption on\nJanuary 1, 2020, compared with the prior incurred loss\nmethodology, is largely due to more precise contractual\nmaturities that result in shorter remaining tenors, the\nincorporation of recoveries and use of more specific historical\nloss data based on an increase in portfolio segmentation across\nindustries and geographies. The Company primarily bases its ACL\non models that assess the likelihood and severity of credit\nevents and their impact on cash flows under R&S forecasted\neconomic scenarios. Allowances consider the probability of the\nborrower\u2019s default, the loss the Company would incur upon\ndefault and the borrower\u2019s exposure at default. Such models\ndiscount the present value of all future cash flows, using the\nasset\u2019s effective interest rate (EIR). Citi applies a more\nsimplified approach based on historical loss rates to certain\nexposures recorded in Other assets and certain loan exposures in\nthe private bank. The Company considers the risk of nonpayment\nto be zero for U.S. Treasuries and U.S. government-sponsored\nagency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, as such,\nCiti does not have an ACL for these securities. For all other\nHTM debt securities, ECLs are estimated using PD models and\ndiscounting techniques, which incorporate assumptions regarding\nthe likelihood and severity of credit losses. For structured\nsecurities, specific models use relevant assumptions for the\nunderlying collateral type. A discounting approach is applied to\nHTM direct obligations of a single issuer, similar to that used\nfor corporate HFI loans. Other Financial Assets with Zero\nExpected Credit Losses For certain financial assets, zero\nexpected credit losses will be recognized where the expectation\nof nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, based on\nthere being no history of loss and the nature of the\nreceivables. Secured Financing Transactions Most of Citi\u2019s\nreverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing arrangements\nand margin loans require that the borrower continually adjust\nthe amount of the collateral securing Citi\u2019s interest, primarily\nresulting from changes in the fair value of such collateral. In\nsuch arrangements, ACLs are recorded based only on the amount by\nwhich the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of\nthe collateral. No ACLs are recorded where the fair value of the\ncollateral is\n                              151                               \nequal to or exceeds the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis, as Citi\ndoes not expect to incur credit losses on such well-\ncollateralized exposures. For certain margin loans presented in\nLoans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, credit losses are\nestimated using the same approach as corporate loans. Accrued\nInterest CECL permits entities to make an accounting policy\nelection not to reserve for interest, if the entity has a policy\nin place that will result in timely reversal or write-off of\ninterest. However, when a non-accrual or timely charge-off\npolicy is not applied, an ACL is recognized on accrued interest.\nFor HTM debt securities, Citi established a non-accrual policy\nthat results in timely write-off of accrued interest. For\ncorporate loans, where a timely charge-off policy is used, Citi\nhas elected to recognize an ACL on accrued interest receivable.\nThe LGD models for corporate loans include an adjustment for\nestimated accrued interest. Reasonably Expected TDRs For\ncorporate loans, the reasonable expectation of TDR concept\nrequires that the contractual life over which ECLs are estimated\nbe extended when a TDR that results in a tenor extension is\nreasonably expected. Reasonably expected TDRs are included in\nthe life of the asset. A discounting technique or collateral-\ndependent practical expedient is used for non-accrual and TDR\nloan exposures that do not share risk characteristics with other\nloans and are individually assessed. Loans modified in\naccordance with the CARES Act and bank regulatory guidance are\nnot classified as TDRs. Purchased Credit Deteriorated (PCD)\nAssets ASC 326 requires entities that have acquired financial\nassets (such as loans and HTM securities) with an intent to\nhold, to evaluate whether those assets have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since\norigination. These assets are subject to specialized accounting\nat initial recognition under CECL. Subsequent measurement of PCD\nassets will remain consistent with other purchased or originated\nassets, i.e., non-PCD assets. CECL introduces the notion of PCD\nassets, which replaces purchased credit impaired (PCI)\naccounting under prior U.S. GAAP. CECL requires the estimation\nof credit losses to be performed on a pool basis unless a PCD\nasset does not share characteristics with any pool. If certain\nPCD assets do not meet the conditions for aggregation, those PCD\nassets should be accounted for separately. This determination\nmust be made at the date the PCD asset is purchased. In\nestimating ECLs from day 2 onward, pools can potentially be\nreassembled based upon similar risk characteristics. When PCD\nassets are pooled, Citi determines the amount of the initial ACL\nat the pool level. The amount of the initial ACL for a PCD asset\nrepresents the portion of the total discount at acquisition that\nrelates to credit and is recognized as a \u201cgross-up\u201d of the\npurchase price to arrive at the PCD asset\u2019s (or pool\u2019s)\namortized cost. Any difference between the unpaid principal\nbalance and the amortized cost is considered to be related to\nnon-credit factors and results in a discount or premium, which\nis amortized to interest income over the life of the individual\nasset (or pool). Direct expenses incurred related to the\nacquisition of PCD assets and other assets and liabilities in a\nbusiness combination are expensed as incurred. Subsequent\naccounting for acquired PCD assets is the same as the accounting\nfor originated assets; changes in the allowance are recorded in\nProvisions for credit losses . Consumer Citi does not purchase\nwhole portfolios of PCD assets in its retail businesses.\nHowever, there may be a small portion of a purchased portfolio\nthat is identified as PCD at the purchase date. Interest income\nrecognition does not vary between PCD and non-PCD assets. A\nconsumer financial asset is considered to be more-than-\ninsignificantly credit deteriorated if it is more than 30 days\npast due at the purchase date. Corporate Citi generally\nclassifies wholesale loans and debt securities classified HTM or\nAFS as PCD when both of the following criteria are met: (i) the\npurchase price discount is at least 10% of par and (ii) the\npurchase date is more than 90 days after the origination or\nissuance date. Citi classifies HTM beneficial interests rated\nAA- and lower obtained at origination from certain\nsecuritization transactions as PCD when there is a significant\ndifference (i.e., 10% or greater) between contractual cash\nflows, adjusted for prepayments, and expected cash flows at the\ndate of recognition. Reserve Estimates and Policies Management\nprovides reserves for an estimate of lifetime ECLs in the funded\nloan portfolio on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the form of\nan ACL. These reserves are established in accordance with\nCitigroup\u2019s credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Citi\u2019s Chief Risk\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the\ncredit loss reserves each quarter with risk management and\nfinance representatives for each applicable business area.\nApplicable business areas include those having classifiably\nmanaged portfolios, where internal credit risk ratings are\nassigned (primarily ICG) and delinquency managed portfolios\n(primarily GCB) or modified consumer loans, where concessions\nwere granted due to the borrowers\u2019 financial difficulties. The\naforementioned representatives for these business areas present\nrecommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded\nlending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and\nqualitative data discussed below: Estimated credit losses for\nnon-performing, non-homogeneous exposures within a business\nline\u2019s classifiably managed portfolio and impaired smaller-\nbalance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified due to\nthe borrowers\u2019 financial difficulties, where it was determined\nthat a concession was granted to the borrower. Consideration may\nbe given to the following, as appropriate, when determining this\nestimate: (i) the present value of expected future cash flows\ndiscounted at the loan\u2019s original effective rate, (ii) the\nborrower\u2019s overall financial condition, resources and payment\nrecord and (iii) the prospects for support from financially\nresponsible guarantors or the realizable value of any\ncollateral. In the determination of the\n                              152                               \nACL for TDRs, management considers a combination of historical\nre-default rates, the current economic environment and the\nnature of the modification program when forecasting expected\ncash flows. When impairment is measured based on the present\nvalue of expected future cash flows, the entire change in\npresent value is recorded in Provisions for credit losses .\nEstimated credit losses in the delinquency-managed portfolios\nfor performing exposures. In addition, risk management and\nfinance representatives who cover business areas with\ndelinquency-managed portfolios containing smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans present their recommended reserve balances\nbased on leading credit indicators, including loan delinquencies\nand changes in portfolio size as well as economic trends,\nincluding current and future housing prices, unemployment,\nlength of time in foreclosure, costs to sell and GDP. This\nmethodology is applied separately for each product within each\ngeographic region in which these portfolios exist. This\nevaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and\njudgments. The frequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery\nrates, size and diversity of individual large credits and\nability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain\nthe foreign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing, among\nother things, are all taken into account during this review.\nChanges in these estimates could have a direct impact on the\ncredit costs in any period and could result in a change in the\nallowance. Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments Credit\nloss reserves are recognized on all off-balance sheet\ncommitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. Corporate\nloan EAD models include an incremental usage factor (or credit\nconversion factor) to estimate ECLs on amounts undrawn at the\nreporting date. Off-balance sheet commitments include unfunded\nexposures, revolving facilities, securities underwriting\ncommitments, letters of credit, HELOCs and financial guarantees,\nwhich excludes performance guarantees. This reserve is\nclassified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other\nliabilities . Changes to the allowance for unfunded lending\ncommitments are recorded in Provision for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments . Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\nMortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are recognized as intangible\nassets when purchased or when the Company sells or securitizes\nloans acquired through purchase or origination and retains the\nright to service the loans. Mortgage servicing rights are\naccounted for at fair value, with changes in value recorded in\nOther revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income.\nFor additional information on the Company\u2019s MSRs, see Notes 16\nand 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair\nvalue of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment\ntesting and interim assessments between annual tests if an event\noccurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying\namount. Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other and\nupon the adoption of ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2020, the\nCompany has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine\nif it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If,\nafter assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the\nCompany determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nno further testing is necessary. If, however, the Company\ndetermines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the\nCompany must perform the quantitative test. The Company has an\nunconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for\nany reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly\nto the quantitative test. The quantitative test requires a\ncomparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to\nits carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the\nreporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related\ngoodwill is considered not impaired and no further analysis is\nnecessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds\nthe fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount\nequal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to that reporting unit. Upon any business disposition,\ngoodwill is allocated to, and derecognized with, the disposed\nbusiness based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed\nbusiness to the fair value of the reporting unit. Additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s goodwill impairment testing can be found\nin Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible\nAssets Intangible assets\u2014 including core deposit intangibles,\npresent value of future profits, purchased credit card\nrelationships, credit card contract related intangibles, other\ncustomer relationships and other intangible assets, but\nexcluding MSRs\u2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nIntangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite useful\nlives, primarily trade names, are not amortized and are subject\nto annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the carrying\nvalue of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair\nvalue. For other intangible assets subject to amortization, an\nimpairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not\nrecoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset.\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities Other assets include, among\nother items, loans HFS, deferred tax assets, equity method\ninvestments, interest and fees receivable, lease right-of-use\nassets, premises and equipment (including purchased and\ndeveloped software), repossessed assets and other receivables.\nOther liabilities include, among other items, accrued expenses\nand other payables, lease liabilities, deferred tax liabilities\nand reserves for legal claims, taxes, unfunded lending\ncommitments, repositioning reserves and other payables.\n                              153                               \nOther Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Assets Real estate or\nother assets received through foreclosure or repossession are\ngenerally reported in Other assets , net of a valuation\nallowance for selling costs and subsequent declines in fair\nvalue. Securitizations There are two key accounting\ndeterminations that must be made relating to securitizations.\nCiti first makes a determination as to whether the\nsecuritization entity must be consolidated. Second, it\ndetermines whether the transfer of financial assets to the\nentity is considered a sale under GAAP. If the securitization\nentity is a VIE, the Company consolidates the VIE if it is the\nprimary beneficiary (as discussed in \u201cVariable Interest\nEntities\u201d above). For all other securitization entities\ndetermined not to be VIEs in which Citigroup participates,\nconsolidation is based on which party has voting control of the\nentity, giving consideration to removal and liquidation rights\nin certain partnership structures. Only securitization entities\ncontrolled by Citigroup are consolidated. Interests in the\nsecuritized and sold assets may be retained in the form of\nsubordinated or senior interest-only strips, subordinated\ntranches, spread accounts and servicing rights. In credit card\nsecuritizations, the Company retains a seller\u2019s interest in the\ncredit card receivables transferred to the trusts, which is not\nin securitized form. In the case of consolidated securitization\nentities, including the credit card trusts, these retained\ninterests are not reported on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe securitized loans remain on the balance sheet. Substantially\nall of the consumer loans sold or securitized through non-\nconsolidated trusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential\nmortgage loans. Retained interests in non-consolidated mortgage\nsecuritization trusts are classified as Trading account assets ,\nexcept for MSRs, which are included in Intangible assets on\nCitigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Debt Short-term\nborrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for at amortized\ncost, except where the Company has elected to report the debt\ninstruments, including certain structured notes, at fair value,\nor the debt is in a fair value hedging relationship. Transfers\nof Financial Assets For a transfer of financial assets to be\nconsidered a sale: (i) the assets must be legally isolated from\nthe Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the\npurchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets\ntransferred (or, if the purchaser is an entity whose sole\npurpose is to engage in securitization and asset-backed\nfinancing activities through the issuance of beneficial\ninterests and that entity is constrained from pledging the\nassets it receives, each beneficial interest holder must have\nthe right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests) and\n(iii) the Company may not have an option or obligation to\nreacquire the assets. If these sale requirements are met, the\nassets are removed from the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is\nconsidered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized\nas the Company\u2019s liability. A legal opinion on a sale generally\nis obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has\ncontinuing involvement with assets transferred or with the\nsecuritization entity. For a transfer to be eligible for sale\naccounting, that opinion must state that the asset transfer\nwould be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would\nnot be consolidated with the Company\u2019s other assets in the event\nof the Company\u2019s insolvency. For a transfer of a portion of a\nfinancial asset to be considered a sale, the portion transferred\nmust meet the definition of a participating interest. A\nparticipating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an\nentire financial asset; all cash flows must be divided\nproportionately, with the same priority of payment; no\nparticipating interest in the transferred asset may be\nsubordinated to the interest of another participating interest\nholder; and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange\nthe entire financial asset unless all participating interest\nholders agree. Otherwise, the transfer is accounted for as a\nsecured borrowing. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further discussion. Risk Management\nActivities\u2014Derivatives Used for Hedging Purposes The Company\nmanages its exposures to market movements outside of its trading\nactivities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either\ndirectly or through the use of derivative financial products,\nincluding interest rate swaps, futures, forwards and purchased\noptions, as well as foreign-exchange contracts. These end-user\nderivatives are carried at fair value in Trading account assets\nand Trading account liabilities . See Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of\nthe Company\u2019s hedging and derivative activities. Instrument-\nspecific Credit Risk Citi presents separately in AOCI the\nportion of the total change in the fair value of a liability\nresulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk,\nwhen the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair\nvalue in accordance with the fair value option for financial\ninstruments. Accordingly, the change in fair value of\nliabilities for which the fair value option was elected, related\nto changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit spreads, is presented in\nAOCI . Employee Benefits Expense Employee benefits expense\nincludes current service costs of pension and other\npostretirement benefit plans (which are accrued on a current\nbasis), contributions and unrestricted awards under other\nemployee plans, the amortization of restricted stock awards and\ncosts of other employee benefits. For its most significant\npension and postretirement benefit plans (Significant Plans),\nCitigroup measures and discloses plan obligations, plan assets\nand periodic plan expense quarterly, instead of annually. The\neffect of remeasuring the Significant Plan obligations and\nassets by updating plan actuarial assumptions on a quarterly\nbasis is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) and periodic plan expense. All other plans (All Other\nPlans) are remeasured annually.See Note 8 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                              154                               \nStock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation\nexpense related to stock and option awards over the requisite\nservice period, generally based on the instruments\u2019 grant-date\nfair value, reduced by actual forfeitures as they occur.\nCompensation cost related to awards granted to employees who\nmeet certain age plus years-of-service requirements (retirement-\neligible employees) is accrued in the year prior to the grant\ndate, in the same manner as the accrual for cash incentive\ncompensation. Certain stock awards with performance conditions\nor certain clawback provisions are subject to variable\naccounting, pursuant to which the associated compensation\nexpense fluctuates with changes in Citigroup\u2019s common stock\nprice.See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes The Company is subject to the income tax laws of\nthe U.S. and its states and municipalities, as well as the\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are\ncomplex and may be subject to different interpretations by the\ntaxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In\nestablishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company\nmust make judgments and interpretations about these tax laws.\nThe Company must also make estimates about when in the future\ncertain items will affect taxable income in the various tax\njurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and\nadjudication by the court systems of the various tax\njurisdictions, or may be settled with the taxing authority upon\nexamination or audit. The Company treats interest and penalties\non income taxes as a component of Income tax expense . Deferred\ntaxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that\nhave been recognized in financial statements or tax returns,\nbased upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are\nrecognized subject to management\u2019s judgment about whether\nrealization is more-likely-than-not. ASC 740, Income Taxes ,\nsets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate\nlevel of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions.\nThis interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein a tax\nbenefit is recognized if a position is more-likely-than-not to\nbe sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be\nthe highest tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be\nrealized. ASC 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to\nenhance transparency of an entity\u2019s tax reserves. See Note 9 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description\nof the Company\u2019s tax provision and related income tax assets and\nliabilities. Commissions, Underwriting and Principal\nTransactions Commissions and fees revenues are recognized in\nincome when earned. Underwriting revenues are recognized in\nincome typically at the closing of the transaction. Principal\ntransactions revenues are recognized in income on a trade-date\nbasis.See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a\ndescription of the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies for\nCommissions and fees , and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for details of Principal transactions revenue.\nEarnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) is computed after\ndeducting preferred stock dividends. The Company has granted\nrestricted and deferred share awards with dividend rights that\nare considered to be participating securities, which are akin to\na second class of common stock. Accordingly, a portion of\nCitigroup\u2019s earnings is allocated to those participating\nsecurities in the EPS calculation. Basic earnings per share is\ncomputed by dividing income available to common stockholders\nafter the allocation of dividends and undistributed earnings to\nthe participating securities by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per\nshare reflects the potential dilution that could occur if\nsecurities or other contracts to issue common stock were\nexercised. It is computed after giving consideration to the\nweighted average dilutive effect of the Company\u2019s stock options\nand warrants and convertible securities and after the allocation\nof earnings to the participating securities. Anti-dilutive\noptions and warrants are disregarded in the EPS calculations.\nUse of Estimates Management must make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and the\nrelated Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such\nestimates are used in connection with certain fair value\nmeasurements. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further discussions on estimates used in the\ndetermination of fair value. Moreover, estimates are significant\nin determining the amounts of other-than-temporary impairments,\nimpairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, provisions\nfor probable losses that may arise from credit-related exposures\nand probable and estimable losses related to litigation and\nregulatory proceedings, and income taxes. While management makes\nits best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from\nthose estimates. Cash Flows Cash equivalents are defined as\nthose amounts included in Cash and due from banks and\npredominately all of Deposits with banks . Cash flows from risk\nmanagement activities are classified in the same category as the\nrelated assets and liabilities. Related Party Transactions The\nCompany has related party transactions with certain of its\nsubsidiaries and affiliates. These transactions, which are\nprimarily short-term in nature, include cash accounts,\ncollateralized financing transactions, margin accounts,\nderivative transactions, charges for operational support and the\nborrowing and lending of funds, and are entered into in the\nordinary course of business.\n                              155                               \nACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting for Financial Instruments \u2014 Credit\nLosses Overview In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments \u2014\nCredit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU introduced a new credit loss\nmethodology, the current expected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology, which requires earlier recognition of credit losses\nwhile also providing additional disclosure about credit risk.\nCiti adopted the ASU as of January 1, 2020, which, as discussed\nbelow, resulted in an increase in Citi\u2019s Allowance for credit\nlosses and a decrease to opening Retained earnings , net of\ndeferred income taxes, at January 1, 2020. The CECL methodology\nutilizes a lifetime \u201cexpected credit loss\u201d measurement objective\nfor the recognition of credit losses for loans, held-to-maturity\ndebt securities, receivables and other financial assets measured\nat amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated\nor acquired. The ACL is adjusted each period for changes in\nexpected lifetime credit losses. The CECL methodology represents\na significant change from prior U.S. GAAP and replaced the prior\nmultiple existing impairment methods, which generally required\nthat a loss be incurred before it was recognized. Within the\nlife cycle of a loan or other financial asset, the methodology\ngenerally results in the earlier recognition of the provision\nfor credit losses and the related ACL than prior U.S. GAAP. For\navailable-for-sale debt securities where fair value is less than\ncost that Citi intends to hold or more-likely-than-not will not\nbe required to sell, credit-related impairment, if any, is\nrecognized through an ACL and adjusted each period for changes\nin credit risk. January 1, 2020 CECL Transition (Day 1) Impact\nThe CECL methodology\u2019s impact on expected credit losses, among\nother things, reflects Citi\u2019s view of the current state of the\neconomy, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and Citi\u2019s\nportfolios. At the January 1, 2020 date of adoption, based on\nforecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures at that\ntime, the aggregate impact to Citi was an approximate $\n4.1billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase in the\nAllowance for credit losses , along with a $ 3.1billion after-\ntax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset\nincrease of $ 1.0billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a\n$ 4.9billion build to the Allowance for credit losses for Citi\u2019s\nconsumer exposures, primarily driven by the impact on credit\ncard receivables of longer estimated tenors under the CECL\nlifetime expected credit loss methodology (loss coverage of\napproximately 23months) compared to shorter estimated tenors\nunder the probable loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP (loss\ncoverage of approximately 14months), net of recoveries; and (ii)\na release of $ 0.8billion of reserves primarily related to\nCiti\u2019s corporate net loan loss exposures, largely due to more\nprecise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining\ntenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific\nhistorical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies. Under the CECL\nmethodology, the Allowance for credit losses consists of\nquantitative and qualitative components. Citi\u2019s quantitative\ncomponent of the Allowance for credit losses is model based and\nutilizes a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast,\ncomplemented by the qualitative component described below, in\nestimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the\ncorporate classifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and\nsupportable forecast periods vary by product. For example,\nCiti\u2019s consumer models use a 13-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period and revert to historical loss experience\nthereafter, while its corporate loan models use a nine-quarter\nreasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter\ngraduated transition to historical loss experience. Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the Allowance for credit losses\nconsiders (i) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios based\non the likelihood and severity of a possible recession as\nanother possible scenario; (ii) certain portfolio\ncharacteristics, such as portfolio concentration and collateral\ncoverage; and (iii) model limitations as well as idiosyncratic\nevents. Citi calculates a judgmental management adjustment,\nwhich is an alternative, more adverse scenario that only\nconsiders downside risk. Accounting for Variable Post-Charge-Off\nThird-Party Collection Costs During the second quarter of 2020\nCiti changed its accounting for variable post-charge-off third-\nparty collection costs, whereby these costs were accounted for\nas an increase in expenses as incurred rather than a reduction\nin expected credit recoveries. Citi concluded that such a change\nin the method of accounting is preferable in Citi\u2019s\ncircumstances as it better reflects the nature of these\ncollection costs. That is, these costs do not represent reduced\npayments from borrowers and are similar to Citi\u2019s other\nexecutory third-party vendor contracts that are accounted for as\noperating expenses as incurred. As a result of this change, Citi\nhad a consumer ACL release of $ 426million in the second quarter\nof 2020 for its U.S. cards portfolios and $ 122million in the\nthird quarter of 2020 for its international portfolios. In the\nfourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the second quarter of 2020\naccounting conclusion from a \u201cchange in accounting estimate\neffected by a change in accounting principle\u201d to a \u201cchange in\naccounting principle,\u201d which requires an adjustment to opening\nretained earnings rather than net income, with retrospective\napplication to the earliest period presented. Citi considered\nthe guidance in ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error\nCorrections ; ASC Topic 270, Interim Reporting ; ASC Topic\n250-S99-1, Assessing Materiality ; and ASC Topic 250-S99-23,\nAccounting Changes Not Retroactively Applied Due to\nImmateriality, Considering the Effects of Prior Year\nMisstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year\nFinancial Statements . Citi believes that the effects of the\nrevisions were not material to any previously reported quarterly\nor annual period. As a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and quarterly\nresults have been revised to reflect this change as if it were\neffective as of January 1, 2020 (impacts to 2018 and 2019 were\nde minimis). Accordingly, Citi recorded an increase to its\nbeginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330million\nand a decrease of $ 443million to its ACL. Further, Citi\nrecorded a decrease of $ 18million to its provisions for credit\nlosses on loans in the\n                              156                               \nfirst quarter of 2020 and an increase of $ 339million and $\n122million to its provisions for credit losses on loans in the\nsecond and third quarters of 2020, respectively. In addition,\nCiti`s operating expenses increased by $ 49million and $\n45million, with a corresponding decrease in net credit losses,\nin the first and second quarters of 2020, respectively. As a\nresult of these changes, Citi\u2019s net income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 was $ 330million lower, or $ 0.16per share\nlower, than under the previous presentation as a change in\naccounting estimate. Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting, which provides optional guidance to ease\nthe potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the\neffects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting.\nSpecifically, the guidance permits an entity, when certain\ncriteria are met, to consider amendments to contracts made to\ncomply with reference rate reform to meet the definition of a\nmodification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows hedge accounting\nto be maintained and permits a one-time transfer or sale of\nqualifying held-to-maturity securities. The expedients and\nexceptions provided by the amendments are permitted to be\nadopted any time through December 31, 2022 and do not apply to\ncontract modifications made and hedging relationships entered\ninto or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for certain\noptional expedients elected for certain hedging relationships\nexisting as of December 31, 2022. The ASU was adopted by Citi as\nof June 30, 2020 with prospective application and did not impact\nfinancial results in 2020. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU\nNo. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope , which\nclarifies that the scope of the initial accounting relief issued\nby the FASB in March 2020 includes derivative instruments that\ndo not reference a rate that is expected to be discontinued but\nthat use an interest rate for margining, discounting, or\ncontract price alignment that is modified as a result of\nreference rate reform (commonly referred to as the \"discounting\ntransition\"). The amendments do not apply to contract\nmodifications made after December 31, 2022, new hedging\nrelationships entered into after December 31, 2022, and existing\nhedging relationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods\nafter December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships\nexisting as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain optional\nexpedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through\nthe end of the hedging relationship. The ASU was adopted by Citi\non a full retrospective basis upon issuance and did not impact\nfinancial results in 2020. Lease Accounting In February 2016,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which\nincreases the transparency and comparability of accounting for\nlease transactions. The ASU requires lessees to recognize\nliabilities for operating leases and corresponding right-of-use\n(ROU) assets on the balance sheet. The ASU also requires\nquantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding key\ninformation about leasing arrangements. Lessee accounting for\nfinance leases, as well as lessor accounting, is largely\nunchanged. Effective January 1, 2019, Citi prospectively adopted\nthe provisions of the ASU. At adoption, Citi recognized a lease\nliability and a corresponding ROU asset of approximately $\n4.4billion on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to its\nfuture lease payments as a lessee under operating leases. In\naddition, Citi recorded a $ 151million increase in Retained\nearnings for the cumulative effect of recognizing previously\ndeferred gains on sale/leaseback transactions. Adoption of the\nASU did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement\nof Income. See Notes 14 and 26 for additional details. Citi has\nelected not to separate lease and non-lease components in its\nlease contracts and accounts for them as a single lease\ncomponent. Citi has also elected not to record an ROU asset for\nshort-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less and do\nnot contain purchase options that Citi is reasonably certain to\nexercise. The cost of short-term leases is recognized in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term. In addition, Citi applies the portfolio approach\nto account for certain equipment leases with nearly identical\ncontractual terms. Lessee accounting Operating lease ROU assets\nand lease liabilities are included in Other assets and Other\nliabilities , respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFinance lease assets and liabilities are included in Other\nassets and Long-term debt , respectively, on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Citi uses its incremental borrowing rate,\nfactoring in the lease term, to determine the lease liability,\nwhich is measured at the present value of future lease payments.\nThe ROU asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease\nliability plus any prepaid rent and remaining initial direct\ncosts, less any remaining lease incentives and accrued rent. The\nROU asset is subject to impairment, during the lease term, in a\nmanner consistent with the impairment of long-lived assets. The\nlease terms include periods covered by options to extend or\nterminate the lease depending on whether Citi is reasonably\ncertain to exercise such options. Lessor accounting Lessor\naccounting is largely unchanged under the ASU. Citi acts as a\nlessor for power, railcar, shipping and aircraft assets, where\nCiti has executed operating, direct financing and leveraged\nleasing arrangements. In a direct financing or a leveraged\nlease, Citi derecognizes the leased asset and records a lease\nfinancing receivable at lease commencement in Loans . Upon lease\ntermination, Citi may obtain control of the asset, which is then\nrecorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and\nany remaining receivable for the asset\u2019s residual value is\nderecognized. Under the ASU, leveraged lease accounting is\ngrandfathered and may continue to be applied until the leveraged\nlease is terminated or modified. Upon modification, the lease\nmust be classified as an operating, direct finance or sales-type\nlease in accordance with the ASU.\n                              157                               \nSeparately, as part of managing its real estate footprint, Citi\nsubleases excess real estate space via operating lease\narrangements. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 On December 22,\n2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which\nset forth the accounting for the changes in tax law caused by\nthe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform). SAB 118\nprovided guidance where the accounting under ASC 740 was\nincomplete for certain income tax effects of Tax Reform, at the\ntime of the issuance of an entity\u2019s financial statements for the\nperiod in which Tax Reform was enacted (provisional items). Citi\ndisclosed several provisional items recorded as part of its $\n22.6billion fourth quarter 2017 charge related to Tax Reform.\nCiti completed its accounting for Tax Reform under SAB 118\nduring the fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded a one-time, non-\ncash tax benefit of $ 94million in Corporate/Other related to\namounts that were considered provisional pursuant to SAB 118.\nThe adjustments for the provisional amounts consisted of a $\n1.2billion benefit relating to a reduction of the valuation\nallowance against Citi\u2019s FTC carry-forwards and its U.S.\nresidual DTAs related to its non-U.S. branches, offset by\nadditional charges of $ 0.2billion related to the impact of a\nchange to a \u201cquasi-territorial tax system\u201d and $ 0.9billion\nrelated to the impact of deemed repatriation of undistributed\nearnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Also, Citi has made a policy\nelection to account for taxes on Global Intangible Low Taxed\nIncome (GILTI) as incurred. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (Revenue Recognition), which outlines a single\ncomprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for\nrevenue arising from contracts with customers. The core\nprinciple of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes\nrevenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to\ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which\nthe entity expects to be entitled, in exchange for those goods\nor services. The ASU defines the promised good or service as the\nperformance obligation under the contract. While the guidance\nreplaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP, the\nASU is not applicable to financial instruments and, therefore,\ndoes not impact a majority of Citi\u2019s revenues, including net\ninterest income, loan fees, gains on sales and mark-to-market\naccounting. In accordance with the new revenue recognition\nstandard, Citi has identified the specific performance\nobligation (promised services) associated with the contract with\nthe customer and has determined when that specific performance\nobligation has been satisfied, which may be at a point in time\nor over time depending on how the performance obligation is\ndefined. The contracts with customers also contain the\ntransaction price, which consists of fixed consideration and/or\nconsideration that may vary (variable consideration), and is\ndefined as the amount of consideration an entity expects to be\nentitled to when or as the performance obligation is satisfied,\nexcluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties\n(including transaction taxes). The amounts recognized at the\npoint in time the performance obligation is satisfied may differ\nfrom the ultimate transaction price associated with that\nperformance obligation when a portion of it is based on variable\nconsideration. For example, some consideration is based on the\nclient\u2019s month-end balance or market values, which are unknown\nat the time the contract is executed. The remaining transaction\nprice amount, if any, will be recognized as the variable\nconsideration becomes determinable. In certain transactions, the\nperformance obligation is considered satisfied at a point in\ntime in the future. In this instance, Citi defers revenue on the\nbalance sheet that will only be recognized upon completion of\nthe performance obligation. The new revenue recognition standard\nfurther clarified the guidance related to reporting revenue\ngross as principal versus net as an agent. In many cases, Citi\noutsources a component of its performance obligations to third\nparties. Citi has determined that it acts as principal in the\nmajority of these transactions and therefore presents the\namounts paid to these third parties gross within operating\nexpenses. The Company has retrospectively adopted this standard\nas of January 1, 2018 and as a result was required to report\namounts paid to third parties where Citi is principal to the\ncontract within Operating expenses. The adoption resulted in an\nincrease in both revenue and expenses of approximately $\n1billion for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018\nwith similar amounts for prior years. Prior to adoption, these\nexpense amounts were reported as contra revenue primarily within\nCommissions and fees and Administration and other fiduciary fees\nrevenues. Accordingly, prior periods have been reclassified to\nconform to the new presentation. See Note 5 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for a description of the Company\u2019s revenue\nrecognition policies for Commissions and fees and Administration\nand other fiduciary fees . Income Tax Impact of Intra-Entity\nTransfers of Assets In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2016-16, Income Taxes\u2014Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other\nThan Inventory , which requires an entity to recognize the\nincome tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset\nother than inventory when the transfer occurs. The ASU was\neffective January 1, 2018 and was adopted as of that date. The\nimpact of this standard was an increase of DTAs by approximately\n$ 300million, a decrease of Retained earnings by approximately $\n80million and a decrease of prepaid tax assets by approximately\n$ 380million. Clarifying the Definition of a Business In January\n2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business Combinations\n(Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business. The\ndefinition of a business directly and indirectly affects many\nareas of accounting (e.g., acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and\nconsolidation). The ASU narrows the definition of a business by\nintroducing a quantitative screen as the first step, such that\nif substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets\nacquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a\ngroup of similar identifiable assets, then the set of\ntransferred assets and activities is not a business. If the set\nis not clarified from the quantitative screen, the entity\n                              158                               \nthen evaluates whether the set meets the requirement that a\nbusiness include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive\nprocess that together significantly contribute to the ability to\ncreate outputs. Citi adopted the ASU upon its effective date on\nJanuary 1, 2018, prospectively. The ongoing impact of the ASU\nwill depend upon the acquisition and disposal activities of\nCiti. If fewer transactions qualify as a business, there could\nbe less initial recognition of Goodwill , but also less goodwill\nallocated to disposals. There was no impact during 2018 from the\nadoption of this ASU. Changes in Accounting for Pension and\nPostretirement (Benefit) Expense In March 2017, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2017-07, Compensation\u2014Retirement Benefits (Topic 715):\nImproving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net\nPeriodic Postretirement Benefit Cost , which changes the income\nstatement presentation of net benefit expense and requires\nrestating the Company\u2019s financial statements for each of the\nearlier periods presented in Citi\u2019s annual and interim financial\nstatements. The change in presentation was effective for annual\nand interim periods starting January 1, 2018. The ASU requires\nthat only the service cost component of net benefit expense be\nincluded in Compensation and benefits on the income statement.\nThe other components of net benefit expense are required to be\npresented outside of Compensation and benefits and are presented\nin Other operating expenses . Since both of these income\nstatement line items are part of Operating expenses , total\nOperating expenses and Net income will not change. This change\nin presentation did not have a material effect on Compensation\nand benefits and Other operating expenses and was applied\nprospectively. The components of the net benefit expense are\ndisclosed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe standard also changes the components of net benefit expense\nthat are eligible for capitalization when employee costs are\ncapitalized in connection with various activities, such as\ninternally developed software, construction-in-progress and loan\norigination costs. Prospectively from January 1, 2018, only the\nservice cost component of net benefit expense may be\ncapitalized. Existing capitalized balances are not affected.\nThis change in amounts eligible for capitalization does not have\na material effect on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial\nStatements and related disclosures. Hedging In August 2017, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting\nfor Hedging Activities , which better aligns an entity\u2019s risk\nmanagement activities and financial reporting for hedging\nrelationships through changes to the designation and measurement\nguidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the\npresentation of hedge results. The ASU requires the change in\nthe fair value of the hedging instrument to be presented in the\nsame income statement line as the hedged item and also requires\nexpanded disclosures. Citi adopted this standard on January 1,\n2018 and transferred approximately $ 4billion of prepayable\nmortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds from held-to-\nmaturity (HTM) into available-for-sale (AFS) securities\nclassification as permitted as a one-time transfer upon adoption\nof the standard, as these assets were deemed to be eligible to\nbe hedged under the last-of-layer hedge strategy. The impact to\nopening Retained earnings was immaterial. See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more information. FUTURE\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Long-Duration Insurance Contracts In August\n2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-12, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for\nLong-Duration Contracts , which changes the existing\nrecognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures for long-\nduration contracts issued by an insurance entity. Specifically,\nthe guidance (i) improves the timeliness of recognizing changes\nin the liability for future policy benefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future cash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii) simplifies and improves the accounting\nfor certain market-based options or guarantees associated with\ndeposit (or account balance) contracts, (iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred acquisition costs and (iv) introduces\nadditional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Citi has\ncertain insurance subsidiaries, primarily in the U.S. and\nMexico, that issue long-duration insurance contracts that will\nbe impacted by the requirements of ASU 2018-12. The effective\ndate of ASU No. 2018-12 was deferred for all insurance entities\nby ASU No. 2019-09, Finance Services\u2014Insurance: Effective Date\n(issued in October 2019) and by ASU No. 2020-11, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective Date and Early Application (issued\nNovember 2020). Citi plans to adopt the targeted improvements in\nASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023 and is currently evaluating the\nimpact of the standard on its insurance subsidiaries. Citi does\nnot expect a material impact to its results of operations as a\nresult of adopting the standard. SUPERSEDED ACCOUNTING\nPRINCIPLES Accounting for Credit Losses Prior to January 1,\n2020, Citi applied the incurred loss method for the allowance\nfor credit losses on loans and the other-than-temporary\nimpairment (OTTI) method for HTM securities as follows.\nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses on\nloans represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable credit\nlosses inherent in the portfolio, including probable losses\nrelated to large individually evaluated impaired loans and\ntroubled debt restructurings. Additions to the allowance are\nmade through the Provision for credit losses on loans . Loan\nlosses are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries\nare added. Assets received in exchange for loan claims in a\nrestructuring are initially recorded at fair value, with any\ngain or loss reflected as a recovery or charge-off in the\nprovision.\n                              159                               \nEvaluating HTM Debt Securities\nfor Other-Than-Temporary\nImpairment (OTTI) The Company\nconducts periodic reviews of\nall HTM debt securities with\nunrealized losses to evaluate\nwhether the impairment is\nother-than-temporary.\n\nAn unrealized loss exists when\nthe current fair value of an\nindividual debt security is\nlower than its adjusted\namortized cost basis.\nTemporary losses related to\nHTM debt securities generally\nare not recorded, as these\ninvestments are carried at\nadjusted amortized cost basis.\nHowever, for HTM debt\nsecurities with credit-related\nimpairment, the credit loss is\nrecognized in earnings as\nOTTI, and any difference\nbetween the cost basis\nadjusted for the OTTI and fair\nvalue is recognized in AOCI\nand amortized as an adjustment\nof yield over the remaining\ncontractual life of the\nsecurity.\n                              160                               \n2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND\nSIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS\n\nSummary of Discontinued\nOperations\n\nThe Company\u2019s results from\nDiscontinued operations\nconsisted of residual\nactivities related to the\nsales of the Egg Banking plc\ncredit card business in 2011\nand the German retail banking\nbusiness in 2008.

As part of\nthe sale, Citi derecognized\ntotal assets of $ 137million\nand total liabilities of $\n41million. The transaction\nresulted in a pretax gain on\nsale of approximately $\n250million (approximately $\n150million after-tax) recorded\nin Other revenue in 2018.\nFurther, Citi and the buyer\nentered into a 10-year\nservices framework agreement,\nwith Citi acting as the\ndistributor in exchange for an\nongoing fee.\n\nIncome before taxes for the\ndivested business, excluding\nthe pretax gain on sale, was\nas follows:\n                                                           \n  In millions of dollars       2020       2019       2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Income before taxes       $  \u2014       $  \u2014       $   123  \n                                                           \n                              161                               \n                                                                \n  3.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES;\nADMINISTRATION AND OTHER\nFIDUCIARY FEES\n\nCommissions and Fees The\nprimary components of\nCommissions and fees revenue\nare investment banking fees,\nbrokerage commissions, credit\ncard and bank card income and\ndeposit-related fees.\nInvestment banking fees are\nsubstantially composed of\nunderwriting and advisory\nrevenues. Such fees are\nrecognized at the point in\ntime when Citigroup\u2019s\nperformance under the terms of\na contractual arrangement is\ncompleted, which is typically\nat the closing of a\ntransaction. Reimbursed\nexpenses related to these\ntransactions are recorded as\nrevenue and are included\nwithin investment banking\nfees. In certain instances for\nadvisory contracts, Citi will\nreceive amounts in advance of\nthe deal\u2019s closing. In these\ninstances, the amounts\nreceived will be recognized as\na liability and not recognized\nin revenue until the\ntransaction closes. For the\nperiods presented, the\ncontract liability amount was\nnegligible. Out-of-pocket\nexpenses associated with\nunderwriting activity are\ndeferred and recognized at the\ntime the related revenue is\nrecognized, while out-of-\npocket expenses associated\nwith advisory arrangements are\nexpensed as incurred. In\ngeneral, expenses incurred\nrelated to investment banking\ntransactions, whether\nconsummated or not, are\nrecorded in Other operating\nexpenses . The Company has\ndetermined that it acts as\nprincipal in the majority of\nthese transactions and\ntherefore presents expenses\ngross within Other operating\nexpenses . Brokerage\ncommissions primarily include\ncommissions and fees from the\nfollowing: executing\ntransactions for clients on\nexchanges and over-the-counter\nmarkets; sales of mutual funds\nand other annuity products;\nand assisting clients in\nclearing transactions,\nproviding brokerage services\nand other such activities.\nBrokerage commissions are\nrecognized in Commissions and\nfees at the point in time the\nassociated service is\nfulfilled, generally on the\ntrade execution date. Gains or\nlosses, if any, on these\ntransactions are included in\nPrincipal transactions (see\nNote 6 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements). Sales\nof certain investment products\ninclude a portion of variable\nconsideration associated with\nthe underlying product. In\nthese instances, a portion of\nthe revenue associated with\nthe sale of the product is not\nrecognized until the variable\nconsideration becomes fixed.\nThe Company recognized $\n495million, $ 485million and $\n521million of revenue related\nto such variable consideration\nfor the years ended December\n31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. These amounts\nprimarily relate to\nperformance obligations\nsatisfied in prior periods.\n\nCredit card and bank card\nincome is primarily composed\nof interchange fees, which are\nearned by card issuers based\non purchase sales, and certain\ncard fees, including annual\nfees. Costs related to\ncustomer reward programs and\ncertain payments to partners\n(primarily based on program\nsales, profitability and\ncustomer acquisitions) are\nrecorded as a reduction of\ncredit card and bank card\nincome. Citi\u2019s credit card\nprograms have certain partner\nsharing agreements that vary\nby partner. These partner\nsharing agreements are subject\nto contractually based\nperformance thresholds that if\nmet, would require Citi to\nmake ongoing payments to the\npartner. The threshold is\nbased on the profitability of\na program and is generally\ncalculated based on predefined\nprogram revenues less\npredefined program expenses.\nIn most of Citi\u2019s partner\nsharing agreements, program\nexpenses include net credit\nlosses and, to the extent that\nthe increase in net credit\nlosses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019\nshare for a given program\nyear, it would generally\nresult in lower payments to\npartners in total for that\nyear and vice versa. Further,\nin some instances, other\npartner payments are based on\nprogram sales and new account\nacquisitions.Interchange\nrevenues are recognized as\nearned on a daily basis when\nCiti\u2019s performance obligation\nto transmit funds to the\npayment networks has been\nsatisfied. Annual card fees,\nnet of origination costs, are\ndeferred and amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over a\n12-month period. Costs related\nto card reward programs are\nrecognized when the rewards\nare earned by the cardholders.\nPayments to partners are\nrecognized when incurred.\nDeposit-related fees consist\nof service charges on deposit\naccounts and fees earned from\nperforming cash management\nactivities and other deposit\naccount services. Such fees\nare recognized in the period\nin which the related service\nis provided. Transactional\nservice fees primarily consist\nof fees charged for processing\nservices such as cash\nmanagement, global payments,\nclearing, international funds\ntransfer and other trade\nservices. Such fees are\nrecognized as/when the\nassociated service is\nsatisfied, which normally\noccurs at the point in time\nthe service is requested by\nthe customer and provided by\nCiti. Insurance distribution\nrevenue consists of\ncommissions earned from third-\nparty insurance companies for\nmarketing and selling\ninsurance policies on behalf\nof such entities. Such\ncommissions are recognized in\nCommissions and fees at the\npoint in time the associated\nservice is fulfilled,\ngenerally when the insurance\npolicy is sold to the\npolicyholder. Sales of certain\ninsurance products include a\nportion of variable\nconsideration associated with\nthe underlying product. In\nthese instances, a portion of\nthe revenue associated with\nthe sale of the policy is not\nrecognized until the variable\nconsideration becomes\ndeterminable. The Company\nrecognized $ 290million, $\n322million and $ 386million of\nrevenue related to such\nvariable consideration for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020,\n2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThese amounts primarily relate\nto performance obligations\nsatisfied in prior periods.\nInsurance premiums consist of\npremium income from insurance\npolicies that Citi has\nunderwritten and sold to\npolicyholders.\n                              164                               \nThe following table presents Commissions and fees revenue:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) Includes overdraft fees of $ 100million, $ 127million and $\n128million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively.

The custody product is composed of numerous\nservices related to the administration, safekeeping and\nreporting for both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The\nservices offered to clients include trade settlement,\nsafekeeping, income collection, corporate action notification,\nrecord-keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management.\nThese services are provided for a wide range of securities,\nincluding but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate\nbonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market\ninstruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative\ninstruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and precious\nmetals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the associated\npromised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the\npoint in time the service is requested by the customer and\nprovided by Citi. Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and\ninvestment management services. As an escrow agent, Citi\nreceives, safe-keeps, services and manages clients\u2019 escrowed\nassets, such as cash, securities, property (including\nintellectual property), contracts or other collateral. Citi\nperforms its escrow agent duties by safekeeping the funds during\nthe specified time period agreed upon by all parties and\ntherefore earns its revenue evenly during the contract duration.\nInvestment management services consist of managing assets on\nbehalf of Citi\u2019s retail and institutional clients. Revenue from\nthese services primarily consists of asset-based fees for\nadvisory accounts, which are based on the market value of the\nclient\u2019s assets and recognized monthly, when the market value is\nfixed. In some instances, the Company contracts with third-party\nadvisors and with third-party custodians. The Company has\ndetermined that it acts as principal in the majority of these\ntransactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to third\nparties gross within Other operating expenses .

INCENTIVE PLANS\nDiscretionary Annual Incentive\nAwards Citigroup grants\nimmediate cash bonus payments\nand various forms of immediate\nand deferred awards as part of\nits discretionary annual\nincentive award program\ninvolving a large segment of\nCitigroup\u2019s employees\nworldwide. Most of the shares\nof common stock issued by\nCitigroup as part of its\nequity compensation programs\nare issued to settle the\nvesting of the stock\ncomponents of these awards.\nDiscretionary annual incentive\nawards are generally awarded\nin the first quarter of the\nyear based on the previous\nyear\u2019s performance. Awards\nvalued at less than U.S. $\n100,000(or the local currency\nequivalent) are generally paid\nentirely in the form of an\nimmediate cash bonus. Pursuant\nto Citigroup policy and/or\nregulatory requirements,\ncertain employees are subject\nto mandatory deferrals of\nincentive pay and generally\nreceive 25%\u2013 60% of their\nawards in a combination of\nrestricted or deferred stock,\ndeferred cash stock units or\ndeferred cash. Discretionary\nannual incentive awards to\nmany employees in the EU are\nsubject to deferral\nrequirements regardless of the\ntotal award value, with at\nleast 50% of the immediate\nincentive delivered in the\nform of a stock payment award\nsubject to a restriction on\nsale or transfer (generally,\nfor 12months). Deferred annual\nincentive awards may be\ndelivered in the form of one\nor more award types: a\nrestricted or deferred stock\naward under Citi\u2019s Capital\nAccumulation Program (CAP), or\na deferred cash stock unit\naward and/or a deferred cash\naward under Citi\u2019s Deferred\nCash Award Plan. The\napplicable mix of awards may\nvary based on the employee\u2019s\nminimum deferral requirement\nand the country of employment.\nSubject to certain exceptions\n(principally, for retirement-\neligible employees),\ncontinuous employment within\nCitigroup is required to vest\nin CAP, deferred cash stock\nunit and deferred cash awards.\nPost employment vesting by\nretirement-eligible employees\nand participants who meet\nother conditions is generally\nconditioned upon their\nrefraining from competition\nwith Citigroup during the\nremaining vesting period,\nunless the employment\nrelationship has been\nterminated by Citigroup under\ncertain conditions. Generally,\nthe deferred awards vest in\nequal annual installments over\nthree- or four-yearperiods.\nVested CAP awards are\ndelivered in shares of common\nstock. Deferred cash awards\nare payable in cash and,\nexcept as prohibited by\napplicable regulatory\nguidance, earn a fixed\nnotional rate of interest that\nis paid only if and when the\nunderlying principal award\namount vests. Deferred cash\nstock unit awards are payable\nin cash at the vesting value\nof the underlying stock.\nGenerally, in the EU, vested\nCAP shares are subject to a\nrestriction on sale or\ntransfer after vesting, and\nvested deferred cash awards\nand deferred cash stock units\nare subject to hold back\n(generally, for 6or 12months\nbased on the award type).\n\nUnvested CAP, deferred cash\nstock units and deferred cash\nawards are subject to one or\nmore clawback provisions that\napply in certain\ncircumstances, including gross\nmisconduct. CAP and deferred\ncash stock unit awards, made\nto certain employees, are\nsubject to a formulaic\nperformance-based vesting\ncondition pursuant to which\namounts otherwise scheduled to\nvest will be reduced based on\nthe amount of any pretax loss\nin the participant\u2019s business\nin the calendar year preceding\nthe scheduled vesting date. A\nminimum reduction of 20%\napplies for the first dollar\nof loss for CAP and deferred\ncash stock unit awards.\n\nIn addition, deferred cash\nawards are subject to a\ndiscretionary performance-\nbased vesting condition under\nwhich an amount otherwise\nscheduled to vest may be\nreduced in the event of a\n\u201cmaterial adverse outcome\u201d for\nwhich a participant has\n\u201csignificant responsibility.\u201d\nThese awards are also subject\nto an additional clawback\nprovision pursuant to which\nunvested awards may be\ncanceled if the employee\nengaged in misconduct or\nexercised materially imprudent\njudgment, or failed to\nsupervise or escalate the\nbehavior of other employees\nwho did.\n\nSign-on and Long-Term\nRetention Awards\n\nStock awards and deferred cash\nawards may be made at various\ntimes during the year as sign-\non awards to induce new hires\nto join Citi or to high-\npotential employees as long-\nterm retention awards.\n\nVesting periods and other\nterms and conditions\npertaining to these awards\ntend to vary by grant.\nGenerally, recipients must\nremain employed through the\nvesting dates to vest in the\nawards, except in cases of\ndeath, disability or\ninvoluntary termination other\nthan for gross misconduct.\nThese awards do not usually\nprovide for post employment\nvesting by retirement-eligible\nparticipants.\n\nOutstanding (Unvested) Stock\nAwards\nA summary of the status of\nunvested stock awards granted\nas discretionary annual\nincentive or sign-on and long-\nterm retention awards is\npresented below:\n                                                                \n                                                     Weighted-  \n                                                 average\u00a0grant  \n                                                     date\u00a0fair  \n  Unvested\u00a0stock\u00a0awards           Shares       value per share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unvested at December        30,194,715    $            61.30  \n  31, 2019                                                      \n  Granted(1)                  12,361,412                 76.68  \n  Canceled                      -606,918                 69.22  \n  Vested(2)                  -13,722,917                 58.45  \n  Unvested at December        28,226,292    $            69.25  \n  31, 2020                                                      \n                                                                \n(1) The weighted-average fair\nvalue of the shares granted\nduring 2019 and 2018 was $\n61.78and $ 73.87,\nrespectively.\n(2) The weighted-average fair\nvalue of the shares vesting\nduring 2020 was approximately\n$ 79.68per share.\nTotal unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to\nunvested stock awards was $\n580million at December 31,\n2020.

The PSUs granted each\nFebruary from 2017 to 2020\nwere earned over the preceding\nthree-yearperformance period,\nbased half on return on\ntangible common equity\nperformance in the last year\nof the three-yearperformance\nperiod and the remaining half\non cumulative earnings per\nshare over the three-\nyearperformance period. For\nall award years, if the total\nshareholder return is negative\nover the three-yearperformance\nperiod, executives may earn no\nmore than 100% of the target\nPSUs, regardless of the extent\nto which Citigroup outperforms\npeer firms. The number of PSUs\nultimately earned could vary\nfrom zero, if performance\ngoals are not met, to as much\nas 150% of target, if\nperformance goals are\nmeaningfully exceeded. For all\naward years, the value of each\nPSU is equal to the value of\noneshare of Citi common stock.\nDividend equivalents will be\naccrued and paid on the number\nof earned PSUs after the end\nof the performance period.\nPSUs are subject to variable\naccounting, pursuant to which\nthe associated value of the\naward will fluctuate with\nchanges in Citigroup\u2019s stock\nprice and the attainment of\nthe specified performance\ngoals for each award, until\nthe award is settled solely in\ncash after the end of the\nperformance period. The value\nof the award, subject to the\nperformance goals, is\nestimated using a simulation\nmodel that incorporates\nmultiple valuation\nassumptions, including the\nprobability of achieving the\nspecified performance goals of\neach award.

Participation in these\nplans is generally limited to employees who are not eligible for\ndiscretionary annual incentive awards. Other forms of variable\ncompensation include monthly commissions paid to financial\nadvisors and mortgage loan officers. Summary Except for awards\nsubject to variable accounting, the total expense recognized for\nstock awards represents the grant date fair value of such\nawards, which is generally recognized as a charge to income\nratably over the vesting period, other than for awards to\nretirement-eligible employees and immediately vested awards.\nWhenever awards are made or are expected to be made to\nretirement-eligible employees, the charge to income is\naccelerated based on when the applicable conditions to\nretirement eligibility were or will be met. If the employee is\nretirement eligible on the grant date, or the award is vested at\nthe grant date, the entire expense is recognized in the year\nprior to grant. Recipients of Citigroup stock awards generally\ndo not have any stockholder rights until shares are delivered\nupon vesting or exercise, or after the expiration of applicable\nrequired holding periods. Recipients of restricted or deferred\nstock awards and deferred cash stock unit awards, however, may,\nexcept as prohibited by applicable regulatory guidance, be\nentitled to receive or accrue dividends or dividend-equivalent\npayments during the vesting period. Recipients of restricted\nstock awards generally are entitled to vote the shares in their\naward during the vesting period. Once a stock award vests, the\nshares delivered to the participant are freely transferable,\nunless they are subject to a restriction on sale or transfer for\na specified period. All equity awards granted since April 19,\n2005 have been made pursuant to stockholder-approved stock\nincentive plans that are administered by the Personnel and\nCompensation Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors,\nwhich is composed entirely of independent non-employee\ndirectors. At December 31, 2020, approximately 34.0million\nshares of Citigroup common stock were authorized and available\nfor grant under Citigroup\u2019s 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, the only\nplan from which equity awards are currently granted. The 2019\nStock Incentive Plan and predecessor plans permit the use of\ntreasury stock or newly issued shares in connection with awards\ngranted under the plans. Treasury shares were used to settle\nvestings from 2017 to 2020, and for the first quarter of 2021,\nexcept where local laws favor newly issued shares. The use of\ntreasury stock or newly issued shares to settle stock awards\ndoes not affect the compensation expense recorded in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income for equity awards.\n                              170                               \nIncentive Compensation Cost\nThe following table shows\ncomponents of compensation\nexpense, relating to certain\nof the incentive compensation\nprograms described above:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0dollars          2020        2019        2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Charges for estimated                                         \n  awards to                   $    748    $    683    $    669  \n  retirement-eligible                                           \n  colleagues                                                    \n  Amortization of deferred                                      \n  cash awards,                                                  \n  deferred cash stock              201         355         202  \n  units and                                                     \n  performance stock units                                       \n  Immediately vested stock                                      \n  award                             95          82          75  \n  expense(1)                                                    \n  Amortization of                                               \n  restricted and deferred          420         404         435  \n  stock awards(2)                                               \n  Other variable incentive         627         666         640  \n  compensation                                                  \n  Total                       $  2,091    $  2,190    $  2,021  \n                                                                \n(1) Represents expense for\nimmediately vested stock\nawards that generally were\nstock payments in lieu of cash\ncompensation.

Changes in the plans\u2019 funded status resulting\nfrom changes in the PBO and fair value of plan assets will have\na corresponding impact on Accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) . The actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended\nDecember 31 in the table below are used to measure the year-end\nPBO and the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent\nyear (period). Since Citi\u2019s Significant Plans are measured on a\nquarterly basis, the year-end rates for those plans are used to\ncalculate the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent\nyear\u2019s first quarter. As a result of the quarterly measurement\nprocess, the net periodic (benefit) expense for the Significant\nPlans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the\npreceding quarter-end rates (as shown below for the U.S. and\nnon-U.S. pension and postretirement plans). The actuarial\nassumptions for All Other Plans are measured annually.\n                              174                               \nCertain assumptions used in\ndetermining pension and\npostretirement benefit\nobligations and net benefit\nexpense for the Company\u2019s\nplans are shown in the\nfollowing table:\n                                                                \n  At\u00a0year\u00a0end                           2020              2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Discount rate                                                 \n  U.S. plans                                                    \n  Qualified pension                    2.45%             3.25%  \n  Nonqualified pension                  2.35              3.25  \n  Postretirement                        2.20              3.15  \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range(1)                    -0.25 to 11.15    -0.10 to 11.30  \n  Weighted average                      3.14              3.65  \n  Non-U.S. postretirement                                       \n  plans                                                         \n  Range                           0.80to8.55        0.90to9.10  \n  Weighted average                      7.42              7.76  \n  Future compensation                                           \n  increase rate(2)                                              \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range                          1.20to11.25       1.50to11.50  \n  Weighted average                      3.10              3.17  \n  Expected return on                                            \n  assets                                                        \n  U.S. plans                                                    \n  Qualified pension                     5.80              6.70  \n  Postretirement(3)                5.80/1.50         6.70/3.00  \n  Non-U.S. pension plans                                        \n  Range                          0.00to11.50       0.00to11.50  \n  Weighted average                      3.39              3.95  \n  Non-U.S. postretirement                                       \n  plans                                                         \n  Range                           5.95to8.00        6.20to8.00  \n  Weighted average                      7.99              7.99  \n                                                                \n(1) Due to substantial\ndownward movement in yields,\nthere were negative discount\nrates for plans with\nrelatively short duration in\nmajor markets, such as the\nEurozone and Switzerland.

However, where\ndeveloped corporate bond\nmarkets do not exist, the\ndiscount rates are selected by\nreference to local government\nbond rates with a premium\nadded to reflect the\nadditional risk for corporate\nbonds in certain countries.\nEffective December 31, 2019,\nthe established rounding\nconvention is to the nearest 5\nbps for all countries.\nExpected Return on Assets The\nCompany determines its\nassumptions for the expected\nreturn on assets for its U.S.\npension and postretirement\nplans using a \u201cbuilding block\u201d\napproach, which focuses on\nranges of anticipated rates of\nreturn for each asset class. A\nweighted average range of\nnominal rates is then\ndetermined based on target\nallocations to each asset\nclass. Market performance over\na number of earlier years is\nevaluated covering a wide\nrange of economic conditions\nto determine whether there are\nsound reasons for projecting\nany past trends. The Company\nconsiders the expected return\non assets to be a long-term\nassessment of return\nexpectations and does not\nanticipate changing this\nassumption unless there are\nsignificant changes in\ninvestment strategy or\neconomic conditions. This\ncontrasts with the selection\nof the discount rate and\ncertain other assumptions,\nwhich are reconsidered\nannually (or quarterly for the\nSignificant Plans) in\naccordance with GAAP. The\nexpected return on assets for\nthe U.S. pension and\npostretirement plans Trust was\n5.80% at December 31, 2020 and\n6.70% at December 31, 2019 and\n2018. The expected return on\nassets reflects the expected\nannual appreciation of the\nplan assets and reduces the\nCompany\u2019s annual pension\nexpense. The expected return\non assets is deducted from the\nsum of service cost, interest\ncost and other components of\npension expense to arrive at\nthe net pension (benefit)\nexpense.\nThe following table shows the expected return on assets used in\ndetermining the Company\u2019s pension expense compared to the actual\nreturn on assets during 2020, 2019 and 2018 for the U.S. pension\nand postretirement plans:\n                                                                \n  U.S. plans                 2020          2019           2018  \n  (During the year)                                             \n  Expected return on                                            \n  assets                                                        \n  U.S. pension and          6.70%         6.70%    6.80%/6.70%  \n  postretirement trust                                          \n  VEBA trust                 3.00          3.00           3.00  \n  Actual return on                                              \n  assets(1)                                                     \n  U.S. pension and          12.84         15.20          -3.40  \n  postretirement trust                                          \n  VEBA trust                 2.11    1.91to2.76     0.43to1.41  \n                                                                \n(1) Actual return on assets is presented net of fees.\nSensitivities of Certain Key\nAssumptions\nThe following tables summarize the effect on pension expense:\n                                                                \n                           Discount rate                        \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0               increase                        \n  dollars                           2020       2019       2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. plans         $                34    $    28    $    25  \n  Non-U.S. plans                     -16        -19        -22  \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n                                decrease                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0                   2020       2019       2018  \n  dollars                                                       \n  U.S. plans         $               -52    $   -44    $   -37  \n  Non-U.S. plans                      25         32         32  \n                                                                \nThe U.S. Qualified Pension\nPlan was frozen in 2008, and\nas a result, most service\ncosts have been eliminated.\nThe pension expense for the\nU.S. Qualified Pension Plan is\ntherefore driven primarily by\ninterest cost rather than by\nservice cost. An increase in\nthe discount rate generally\nincreases pension expense. For\nNon-U.S. Pension Plans that\nare not frozen (in countries\nsuch as Mexico, the U.K. and\nSouth Korea), there is more\nservice cost. The pension\nexpense for the Non-U.S. Plans\nis driven by both service cost\nand interest cost. An increase\nin the discount rate generally\ndecreases pension expense due\nto the greater impact on\nservice cost compared to\ninterest cost. Since the U.S.\nQualified Pension Plan was\nfrozen, most of the\nprospective service cost has\nbeen eliminated and the\ngain/loss amortization period\nwas changed to the life\nexpectancy for inactive\nparticipants. As a result,\npension expense for the U.S.\nQualified Pension Plan is\ndriven more by interest costs\nthan service costs, and an\nincrease in the discount rate\nwould increase pension\nexpense, while a decrease in\nthe discount rate would\ndecrease pension expense.\nThe following tables summarize the effect on pension expense:\n                                                                \n                         Expected return                        \n                               on assets                        \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0               increase                        \n  dollars                           2020       2019       2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. plans         $              -123    $  -123    $  -126  \n  Non-U.S. plans                     -66        -64        -64  \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n                                decrease                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0                   2020       2019       2018  \n  dollars                                                       \n  U.S. plans         $               123    $   123    $   126  \n  Non-U.S. plans                      66         64         64  \n                                                                \n                              176                               \nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate\nAssumed health care cost trend\nrates were as follows:\n                                                             \n                                              2020     2019  \n  Health care\u00a0cost\u00a0increase\u00a0rate\u00a0for                         \n  U.S.\u00a0plans                                                 \n  Following year                             6.50%    6.75%  \n  Ultimate rate to which cost increase is     5.00     5.00  \n  assumed to decline                                         \n  Year in which the ultimate rate is          2027     2027  \n  reached                                                    \n  Health care\u00a0cost\u00a0increase\u00a0rate\u00a0for                         \n  non-U.S.\u00a0plans (weighted average)                          \n  Following year                             6.85%    6.85%  \n  Ultimate rate to which cost increase is     6.85     6.85  \n  assumed to decline                                         \n  Year in which the ultimate rate             2021     2020  \n  is reached                                                 \n                                                             \nInterest Crediting Rate The\nCompany has cash balance plans\nand other plans with promised\ninterest crediting rates.

is to\ninvest in a prudent manner for\nthe exclusive purpose of\nproviding benefits to\nparticipants. The investment\nstrategies are targeted to\nproduce a total return that,\nwhen combined with the\nCompany\u2019s contributions to the\nfunds, will maintain the\nfunds\u2019 ability to meet all\nrequired benefit obligations.\nRisk is controlled through\ndiversification of asset types\nand investments in domestic\nand international equities,\nfixed income securities and\ncash and short-term\ninvestments. The target asset\nallocation in most locations\noutside the U.S. is primarily\nin equity and debt securities.\nThese allocations may vary by\ngeographic region and country\ndepending on the nature of\napplicable obligations and\nvarious other regional\nconsiderations. The wide\nvariation in the actual range\nof plan asset allocations for\nthe funded non-U.S. plans is a\nresult of differing local\nstatutory requirements and\neconomic conditions. For\nexample, in certain countries\nlocal law requires that all\npension plan assets must be\ninvested in fixed income\ninvestments, government funds\nor local-country securities.\nSignificant Concentrations of\nRisk in Plan Assets The assets\nof the Company\u2019s pension plans\nare diversified to limit the\nimpact of any individual\ninvestment.

As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup and its U.S. subsidiaries\nare currently subject to U.S. taxation on all non-U.S. pretax\nearnings of non-U.S. branches. Beginning in 2018, there is a\nseparate foreign tax credit (FTC) basket for branches. Also,\ndividends from a non-U.S. subsidiary or affiliate are\neffectively exempt from U.S. taxation. The Company provides\nincome taxes on the book over tax basis differences of non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries except to the extent that such differences are\nindefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At December 31, 2020, $\n11.0billion of basis differences of non-U.S. entities was\nindefinitely invested. At the existing tax rates, additional\ntaxes (net of U.S. FTCs) of $ 4.3billion would have to be\nprovided if such assertions were reversed. Income taxes are not\nprovided for the Company\u2019s \u201csavings bank base year bad debt\nreserves\u201d that arose before 1988, because under current U.S. tax\nrules, such taxes will become payable only to the extent that\nsuch amounts are distributed in excess of limits prescribed by\nfederal law. At December 31, 2020, the amount of the base year\nreserves totaled approximately $ 358million (subject to a tax of\n$ 75million).\n                              184                               \nDeferred Tax Assets As of\nDecember 31, 2020, Citi had a\nvaluation allowance of $\n5.2billion, composed of\nvaluation allowances of $\n1.0billion on its general\nbasket FTC carry-forwards, $\n2.4billion on its branch\nbasket FTC carry-forwards, $\n1.0billion on its U.S.\nresidual DTA related to its\nnon-U.S. branches, $\n0.6billion on local non-U.S.\nDTAs and $ 0.2billion on state\nnet operating loss carry-\nforwards. The amount of Citi\u2019s\nvaluation allowances (VA) may\nchange in future years. In\n2020, Citi\u2019s VA for carry-\nforward FTCs in its branch\nbasket decreased by $\n1.0billion and the related VA\nfor the U.S. tax effect on\nnon-U.S. branch temporary\ndifferences increased by $\n0.2billion. Of this total\nbranch-related change of $\n0.8billion, $ 0.6billion\nimpacted the tax provision as\ndiscussed below. The remainder\nof the branch basket-related\nVA decrease of $ 0.2billion\nwas primarily due to carry-\nforward expirations and\nchanges in foreign exchange\nrates. The level of branch\npretax income, the local\nbranch tax rate and the\nallocations of Overall\nDomestic Loss (ODL) and\nexpenses for U.S. tax purposes\nto the branch basket are the\nmain factors in determining\nthe branch VA. Citi computed\nthese factors for 2020. While\nthe COVID-19 pandemic reduced\nbranch earnings, the allocated\nODL was not diminished since a\nlarge portion of the pandemic\nlosses will not be\nrecognizable for U.S. taxable\nincome until a future period.\nIn addition, lower than\nforecasted U.S. interest rates\nresulted in a lower allocation\nof interest expense to\nnon-U.S. branches. The\ncombination of the factors\nenumerated are reflected in\nthe VA release of $ 0.5billion\nin Citi\u2019s full-year effective\ntax rate. Citi also released\nbranch basket VA of $\n0.1billion in the fourth\nquarter, with respect to\nfuture years, based upon\nCiti\u2019s Operating Plan and\nestimates of future branch\nbasket factors, as outlined\nabove. In Citi\u2019s general\nbasket for FTCs, changes in\nthe forecasted amount of\nincome in U.S. locations\nderived from sources outside\nthe U.S., in addition to tax\nexamination changes from prior\nyears, could alter the amount\nof valuation allowance that is\nneeded against such FTCs. The\nvaluation allowance for the\ngeneral basket decreased by $\n0.1billion to $ 1.0billion,\nprimarily due to the\nexpiration of carry-forwards\nin 2020. In the general FTC\nbasket, foreign source income,\nan important driver in the\nutilization of FTC carry-\nforwards for the current year\nand future years, has been\nreduced due to the compression\nin interest rate spreads. The\npandemic has otherwise reduced\nU.S. income, which impacts ODL\nusage and, correspondingly,\nthe utilization of FTC carry-\nforwards. Accordingly,\nmanagement identified actions,\nwhich became prudent due to\nthe effects of the pandemic,\nto increase future foreign\nsource income and U.S. taxable\nincome. These planning actions\ninclude geographic asset\nmovements, deferral of future\nFTC recognition and\ncapitalization of expenses for\ntax purposes, resulting in no\ntax provision change to Citi\u2019s\ngeneral basket VA in 2020. In\nlight of the pandemic, Citi\nwill continue to monitor its\nforecasts and mix of earnings,\nwhich could affect Citi\u2019s\nvaluation allowance against\nFTC carry-forwards. Citi\ncontinues to look for\nadditional actions that are\nprudent and feasible, taking\ninto account client,\nregulatory and operational\nconsiderations.\n\nThe valuation allowance for\nU.S. residual DTA related to\nits non-U.S. branches\nincreased from $ 0.8billion to\n$ 1.0billion, primarily due to\nhigher capitalized expenses.\nIn addition, the non-U.S.\nlocal valuation allowance was\nreduced from $ 1.0billion to $\n0.6billion, primarily due to\nan expiration of NOL carry-\nforwards in a non-U.S.\njurisdiction.

    \n(1) Before valuation\nallowance.\n(2) Pretax.\nThe time remaining for utilization of the FTC component has\nshortened, given the passage of time. Although realization is\nnot assured, Citi believes that the realization of the\nrecognized net DTAs of $ 24.8billion at December 31, 2020 is\nmore-likely-than-not, based upon expectations as to future\ntaxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and\nconsideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined\nin ASC 740, Income Taxes ). The majority of Citi\u2019s U.S. federal\nnet operating loss carry-forward and all of its New York State\nand City net operating loss carry-forwards, are subject to a\ncarry-forward period of 20years. This provides enough time to\nfully utilize the DTAs pertaining to these existing NOL carry-\nforwards. This is due to Citi\u2019s forecast of sufficient U.S.\ntaxable income and the fact that New York State and City\ncontinue to tax Citi\u2019s non-U.S. income. With respect to the FTCs\ncomponent of the DTAs, the carry-forward period is 10years.\nUtilization of FTCs in any year is generally limited to 21% of\nforeign source taxable income in that year. However, overall\ndomestic losses that Citi has incurred of approximately $\n26billion as of December 31, 2020 are allowed to be reclassified\nas foreign source income to the extent of 50%\u2013 100% (at\ntaxpayer\u2019s election) of domestic source income produced in\nsubsequent years. Such resulting foreign source income would\nsubstantially cover the FTC carry-forwards after valuation\nallowance. As noted in the tables above, Citi\u2019s FTC carry-\nforwards were $ 4.4billion ($ 7.8billion before valuation\nallowance) as of December 31, 2020, compared to $ 6.3billion as\nof December 31, 2019. Citi believes that it will generate\nsufficient U.S. taxable income within the 10-year carry-forward\nperiod to be able to utilize the net FTCs after the valuation\nallowance, after considering any FTCs produced in the tax return\nfor such period, which must be used prior to any carry-forward\nutilization.\n                              186                               \n                                                                \n  10.

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 15 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation.\nThe resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized\nfinancing transactions. Citi executes these transactions\nprimarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to facilitate\ncustomer matched-book activity and to efficiently fund a portion\nof Citi\u2019s trading inventory. Transactions executed by Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing\nactivity.\n\nTo maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market\nconditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages\nthese activities by taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor. Citi\nmanages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions\nby conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in\ncapacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client\nactions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty\ndiversification by establishing concentration triggers and\nassessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.\n\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to\n\nmaintain contractual margin protection. For resale and\nrepurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts\nadditional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin\nprotection. Collateral typically consists of government and\ngovernment-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds,\nequities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. The\nresale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother type of default under the relevant master agreement.\nEvents of default generally include (i) failure to deliver cash\nor securities as required under the transaction, (ii) failure to\nprovide or return cash or securities as used for margining\npurposes, (iii) breach of representation, (iv) cross-default to\nanother transaction entered into among the parties, or, in some\ncases, their affiliates and (v) a repudiation of obligations\nunder the agreement. The counterparty that receives the\nsecurities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in\nits use of the securities, with the exception of transactions\nexecuted on a tri-party basis, where the collateral is\nmaintained by a custodian and operational limitations may\nrestrict its use of the securities. A substantial portion of the\nresale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value, as\ndescribed in Notes 24 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of\ncash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as\nspecified in the respective agreements. The securities borrowing\nand lending agreements also represent collateralized financing\ntransactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements.\nCollateral typically consists of government and government-\nagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities.\nSimilar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities\nborrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother default by the other party under the relevant master\nagreement. Events of default and rights to use securities under\nthe securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to\nthe resale and repurchase agreements referenced above. A\nsubstantial portion of securities borrowing and lending\nagreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 25 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities\nloaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount\ngenerally in excess of the market value of the securities\nloaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities\nborrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or\nposts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection.\n                              188                               \nThe enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the\nmaster netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements,\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements, is evidenced to\nthe extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion has been obtained\nfrom counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding the enforceability of these\nagreements and (ii) the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting\nparty to terminate and close out transactions on a net basis\nunder these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under\napplicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or similar proceeding. A legal opinion may not have\nbeen sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local\nlaw is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the\nenforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or\nconflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of\nsuch rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may\nbe nonexistent or unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For\nexample, this may be the case for certain sovereigns,\nmunicipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. The\nfollowing tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements and\nthe related offsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45.\nThe tables also include amounts related to financial instruments\nthat are not permitted to be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but\nwould be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained.\nRemaining exposures continue to be secured by financial\ncollateral, but the Company may not have sought or been able to\nobtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the\noffsetting right.\n                                                                \n

BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND\nBROKERAGE PAYABLES\n\nThe Company has receivables\nand payables for financial\ninstruments sold to and\npurchased from brokers,\ndealers and customers, which\narise in the ordinary course\nof business. Citi is exposed\nto risk of loss from the\ninability of brokers, dealers\nor customers to pay for\npurchases or to deliver the\nfinancial instruments sold, in\nwhich case Citi would have to\nsell or purchase the financial\ninstruments at prevailing\nmarket prices. Credit risk is\nreduced to the extent that an\nexchange or clearing\norganization acts as a\ncounterparty to the\ntransaction and replaces the\nbroker, dealer or customer in\nquestion.\n\nCiti seeks to protect itself\nfrom the risks associated with\ncustomer activities by\nrequiring customers to\nmaintain margin collateral in\ncompliance with regulatory and\ninternal guidelines.

These securitizations are generally considered VIEs.\nThe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is equal\nto the carrying amount of the securities, which is reflected in\nthe table above. For mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations\nin which the Company has other involvement, see Note 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n(3) In August 2020, Citibank transferred $ 13.1billion of\ninvestments in U.S. Treasury securities from AFS classification\nto HTM classification in accordance with ASC 320. At the time of\ntransfer, the securities were in an unrealized gain position of\n$ 144million. The gain amounts will remain in AOCI and will be\namortized over the remaining life of the securities.\n(4) In March 2019, Citibank transferred $ 5billion of agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) from AFS\nclassification to HTM classification in accordance with ASC 320.\nAt the time of transfer, the securities were in an unrealized\nloss position of $ 56million. The loss amounts will remain in\nAOCI and be amortized over the remaining life of the securities.\n(5) In December 2019, Citibank transferred $ 173million of state\nand municipal bonds from AFS classification to HTM\nclassification in accordance with ASC 320. At the time of\ntransfer, the bonds were in an unrealized gain position of $\n5million. The gain amounts will remain in AOCI and be amortized\nover the remaining life of the securities.\n                              196                               \nThe Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these\nsecurities to maturity or, where applicable, to exercise any\nissuer call options, absent any unforeseen significant changes\nin circumstances, including deterioration in credit or changes\nin regulatory capital requirements. The net unrealized losses\nclassified in AOCI for HTM securities primarily relate to debt\nsecurities previously classified as AFS that were transferred to\nHTM, and include any cumulative fair value hedge adjustments.\nThe net unrealized loss amount also includes any non-credit-\nrelated changes in fair value of HTM debt securities that have\nsuffered credit impairment recorded in earnings. The AOCI\nbalance related to HTM debt securities is amortized as an\nadjustment of yield, in a manner consistent with the accretion\nof any difference between the carrying value at the transfer\ndate and par value of the same debt securities.\n\nThe table below shows the fair value of debt securities HTM that\nhave been in an unrecognized loss position at December 31, 2019:\n

An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an ACL. Any remaining fair\nvalue decline for such securities is recorded in AOCI . The\nCompany does not consider the length of time that the fair value\nof a security is below its amortized cost when determining if a\ncredit loss exists. For AFS debt securities, credit losses exist\nwhere Citi does not expect to receive contractual principal and\ninterest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized\ncost basis of a security. The ACL is limited to the amount by\nwhich the AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its\nfair value. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under business policies. The sections\nbelow describe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected\ncredit impairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of December 31, 2020. Mortgage-\nBacked Securities Citi records no allowances for credit losses\non U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities,\nbecause the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the\nevent of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses\nand due to the nature of the counterparties. State and Municipal\nSecurities The process for estimating credit losses in\nCitigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily based on\na credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings.\nCiti monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing\ndefault protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance.\nThe average external credit rating, ignoring any insurance, is\nAa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other\nindicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-\nspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer\ndefault), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse\nchanges in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell, or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is\nrecognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where\nCiti has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an\nallowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects\nnot to collect, capped at the difference between the bond\u2019s\namortized cost basis and fair value. Equity Method Investments\nManagement assesses equity method investments that have fair\nvalues that are lower than their respective carrying values for\nother-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured\nas price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly\nlisted securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other\nmethods are used (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). For impaired equity method investments that Citi\nplans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair\nvalue will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized in earnings as OTTI regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether\nthe impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the cause of the impairment and the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,\nincluding any specific events that may influence the operations\nof the issuer; \u2022 the intent and ability to hold the investment\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in market value; and \u2022 the length of time and extent to\nwhich fair value has been less than the carrying value.\n                              199

fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.\nImpairment indicators that are\nconsidered include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n\u2022 a significant deterioration\nin the earnings performance,\ncredit rating, asset quality\nor business prospects of the\ninvestee;

The fair\nvalues of these investments are estimated using the NAV of the\nCompany\u2019s ownership interest in the funds. Some of these\ninvestments are in \u201ccovered funds\u201d for purposes of the Volcker\nRule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment activities\nand limits the ownership of, and relationships with, covered\nfunds. On April 21, 2017, Citi\u2019s request for extension of the\npermitted holding period under the Volcker Rule for certain of\nits investments in illiquid funds was approved, allowing the\nCompany to hold such investments until the earlier of five years\nfrom the July 21, 2017 expiration date of the general\nconformance period or the date such investments mature or are\notherwise conformed with the Volcker Rule.\n                                                                \n                                                   Red\u2026         \n                                                   fre\u2026         \n                                                   (if\u00a0         \n            Fair                 Unf\u2026              cur\u2026         \n  In        val\u2026                 com\u2026              eli\u2026         \n  mi\u2026       Dec\u2026       De\u2026       Dec\u2026       De\u2026    mon\u2026    Re\u2026  \n  of         31,       31,        31,       31,    qua\u2026    no\u2026  \n  do\u2026       2020       20\u2026       2020       20\u2026    ann\u2026    pe\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Pr\u2026                                                           \n  eq\u2026    $   123    $  134    $    62    $   62    \u2014       \u2014    \n  fu\u2026                                                           \n  Re\u2026                                                           \n  es\u2026          9        10         20        18    \u2014       \u2014    \n  fu\u2026                                                           \n  Mu\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026         20        26          \u2014         \u2014                 \n  fu\u2026                                                           \n  To\u2026    $   152    $  170    $    82    $   80    \u2014       \u2014    \n                                                                \n(1) Private equity funds include funds that invest in\ninfrastructure, emerging markets and venture capital.\n(2) With respect to the Company\u2019s investments in private equity\nfunds and real estate funds, distributions from each fund will\nbe received as the underlying assets held by these funds are\nliquidated.

These categories\nare classified primarily\naccording to the segment and\nsubsegment that manage the\nloans. Consumer Loans Consumer\nloans represent loans and\nleases managed primarily by\nGCB and Corporate/Other.\nCitigroup has established a\nrisk management process to\nmonitor, evaluate and manage\nthe principal risks associated\nwith its consumer loan\nportfolio. Credit quality\nindicators that are actively\nmonitored include delinquency\nstatus, consumer credit scores\nunder Fair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) and loan to value (LTV)\nratios, each as discussed in\nmore detail below. Included in\nthe loan table above are\nlending products whose terms\nmay give rise to greater\ncredit issues. Credit cards\nwith below-market introductory\ninterest rates and interest-\nonly loans are examples of\nsuch products. These products\nare closely managed using\ncredit techniques that are\nintended to mitigate their\nhigher inherent risk.\nDelinquency Status Delinquency\nstatus is monitored and\nconsidered a key indicator of\ncredit quality of consumer\nloans. Principally, the U.S.\nresidential first mortgage\nloans use the Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation (MBA) method of\nreporting delinquencies, which\nconsiders a loan delinquent if\na monthly payment has not been\nreceived by the end of the day\nimmediately preceding the\nloan\u2019s next due date. All\nother loans use a method of\nreporting delinquencies that\nconsiders a loan delinquent if\na monthly payment has not been\nreceived by the close of\nbusiness on the loan\u2019s next\ndue date. As a general policy,\nresidential first mortgages,\nhome equity loans and\ninstallment loans are\nclassified as non-accrual when\nloan payments are 90days\ncontractually past due. Credit\ncards and unsecured revolving\nloans generally accrue\ninterest until payments are\n180days past due. Home equity\nloans in regulated bank\nentities are classified as\nnon-accrual if the related\nresidential first mortgage is\n90days or more past due.\nMortgage loans, other than\nFederal Housing Administration\n(FHA)-insured loans, are\nclassified as non-accrual\nwithin 60days of notification\nthat the borrower has filed\nfor bankruptcy.\n\nThe policy for re-aging\nmodified U.S. consumer loans\nto current status varies by\nproduct. Generally, one of the\nconditions to qualify for\nthese modifications is that a\nminimum number of payments\n(typically ranging from oneto\nthree) be made. Upon\nmodification, the loan is re-\naged to current status.\nHowever, re-aging practices\nfor certain open-ended\nconsumer loans, such as credit\ncards, are governed by Federal\nFinancial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC)\nguidelines. For open-ended\nconsumer loans subject to\nFFIEC guidelines, one of the\nconditions for a loan to be\nre-aged to current status is\nthat at least threeconsecutive\nminimum monthly payments, or\nthe equivalent amount, must be\nreceived. In addition, under\nFFIEC guidelines, the number\nof times that such a loan can\nbe re-aged is subject to\nlimitations (generally once in\n12 months and twice in five\nyears). Furthermore, FHA and\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n(VA) loans are modified under\nthose respective agencies\u2019\nguidelines and payments are\nnot always required in order\nto re-age a modified loan to\ncurrent.\n                              204                               \nThe following tables provide Citi\u2019s consumer loans by type:\nConsumer Loans, Delinquencies and Non-Accrual

amounts due according to the\noriginal contractual terms of the loan will not be collected.\nImpaired consumer loans include non-accrual loans, as well as\nsmaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been modified\ndue to the borrower\u2019s financial difficulties and where Citi has\ngranted a concession to the borrower. These modifications may\ninclude interest rate reductions and/or principal forgiveness.\nImpaired consumer loans exclude smaller-balance homogeneous\nloans that have not been modified and are carried on a non-\naccrual basis.

Citi\u2019s $\n0.7billion of lease financing\nreceivables, as of December\n31, 2020, is composed of\napproximately equal balances\nof direct financing lease\nreceivables and net\ninvestments in leveraged\nleases. Citi uses the interest\nrate implicit in the lease to\ndetermine the present value of\nits lease financing\nreceivables. Interest income\non direct financing and\nleveraged leases during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020\nwas not material. The\nCompany\u2019s leases have an\naverage remaining maturity of\napproximately three and a half\nyears. In certain cases, Citi\nobtains residual value\ninsurance from third parties\nand/or the lessee to manage\nthe risk associated with the\nresidual value of the leased\nassets. The receivable related\nto the residual value of the\nleased assets is $ 0.3billion\nas of December 31, 2020, while\nthe amount covered by residual\nvalue guarantees is $\n0.2billion. The Company\u2019s\noperating leases, where Citi\nis a lessor, are not\nsignificant to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements. Delinquency Status\nCiti generally does not manage\ncorporate loans on a\ndelinquency basis. Corporate\nloans are identified as\nimpaired and placed on a cash\n(non-accrual) basis when it is\ndetermined, based on actual\nexperience and a forward-\nlooking assessment of the\ncollectability of the loan in\nfull, that the payment of\ninterest or principal is\ndoubtful or when interest or\nprincipal is 90days past due,\nexcept when the loan is well\ncollateralized and in the\nprocess of collection. Any\ninterest accrued on impaired\ncorporate loans and leases is\nreversed at 90days and charged\nagainst current earnings, and\ninterest is thereafter\nincluded in earnings only to\nthe extent actually received\nin cash. When there is doubt\nregarding the ultimate\ncollectability of principal,\nall cash receipts are\nthereafter applied to reduce\nthe recorded investment in the\nloan.

Corporate loans are considered past\ndue when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are\n90days or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30days past due are presented as current.\n(4) Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not\nincluded in the various delinquency columns.\n\nCitigroup has a risk management process to monitor, evaluate and\nmanage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan\nportfolio. As part of its risk management process, Citi assigns\nnumeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on\nquantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and\nfacility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or\nmore often if material events related to the obligor or facility\nwarrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk ratings\ninclude financial condition of the obligor, qualitative\nassessment of management and strategy, amount and sources of\nrepayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee\narrangements, amount and type of any contingencies associated\nwith the obligor and the obligor\u2019s industry and geography. The\nobligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default\nprobabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges\nof loss norms, which are the product of the probability of\ndefault and the loss given default. The investment grade rating\ncategories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as\ndefined by S&P and Moody\u2019s. Loans classified according to the\nbank regulatory definitions as special mention, substandard and\ndoubtful will have risk ratings within the non-investment-grade\ncategories.\n                              213                               \nCorporate Loans Credit Quality Indicators\n                                                                \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                           \u2026        $      $    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026        $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                           \u2026        $      $    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                                                \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           \u2026                    \n                                           9                    \n                                           \u2026        $      $    \n                                           \u2014        $      $    \n                                                                \n                                           \u2026        $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Recorded investment in a loan includes net deferred loan\nfees and costs, unamortized premium or discount, less any direct\nwrite-downs.\n(2) There were no significant revolving line of credit\narrangements that converted to term loans during the year.\n(3) Held-for-investment loans are accounted for on an amortized\ncost basis.\n(4) Includes certain short-term loans with less than one year in\ntenor.\n(5) Other includes installment and other, lease financing and\nloans to government and official institutions.\n(6) Non-rated private bank loans mainly include mortgage and\nreal estate loans to private banking clients.\n(7) Loans at fair value include loans to commercial and\nindustrial, financial institutions, mortgage and real estate and\nother.\nImpaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment\nis expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying\ncollateral and there are no other available and reliable sources\nof repayment, are written down to the lower of carrying value or\ncollateral value, less cost to sell.

While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key assumptions used in the valuations, the\neconomic environment and Citi\u2019s outlook continues to evolve due\nto the challenges and uncertainties related to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Further deterioration in macroeconomic and\nmarket conditions, including potential adverse effects to\neconomic forecasts due to the severity and duration of the\npandemic, as well as the responses of governments, customers and\nclients, could negatively influence the assumptions used in the\nvaluations, in particular, the discount rates, exit multiples\nand growth rates used in net income projections. If the future\nwere to differ from management\u2019s estimate of key assumptions\n(e.g., net interest revenue and loan volume), and associated\ncash flows were to decrease, Citi could potentially experience\nmaterial goodwill impairment charges in the future.

Banking\nSubsidiaries\u2014Constraints on Dividends There are various legal\nlimitations on the ability of Citigroup\u2019s subsidiary depository\ninstitutions to extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise supply\nfunds to Citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries. The approval\nof the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if\ntotal dividends declared in any calendar year were to exceed\namounts specified by the agency\u2019s regulations. In determining\nthe dividends, each subsidiary depository institution must also\nconsider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and\nleverage ratio requirements, as well as policy statements of the\nfederal bank regulatory agencies that indicate that banking\norganizations should generally pay dividends out of current\noperating earnings. Citigroup received $ 2.3billion and $\n17.3billion in dividends from Citibank during 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n                              224                               \n19.

SECURITIZATIONS AND\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n\nUses of Special Purpose\nEntities A special purpose\nentity (SPE) is an entity\ndesigned to fulfill a specific\nlimited need of the company\nthat organized it. The\nprincipal uses of SPEs by Citi\nare to obtain liquidity and\nfavorable capital treatment by\nsecuritizing certain financial\nassets, to assist clients in\nsecuritizing their financial\nassets and to create\ninvestment products for\nclients. SPEs may be organized\nin various legal forms,\nincluding trusts, partnerships\nor corporations. In a\nsecuritization, through the\nSPE\u2019s issuance of debt and\nequity instruments,\ncertificates, commercial paper\nor other notes of\nindebtedness, the company\ntransferring assets to the SPE\nconverts all (or a portion) of\nthose assets into cash before\nthey would have been realized\nin the normal course of\nbusiness. These issuances are\nrecorded on the balance sheet\nof the SPE, which may or may\nnot be consolidated onto the\nbalance sheet of the company\nthat organized the SPE.\nInvestors usually have\nrecourse only to the assets in\nthe SPE, but may also benefit\nfrom other credit\nenhancements, such as a\ncollateral account, a line of\ncredit or a liquidity\nfacility, such as a liquidity\nput option or asset purchase\nagreement. Because of these\nenhancements, the SPE\nissuances typically obtain a\nmore favorable credit rating\nthan the transferor could\nobtain for its own debt\nissuances. This results in\nless expensive financing costs\nthan unsecured debt. The SPE\nmay also enter into derivative\ncontracts in order to convert\nthe yield or currency of the\nunderlying assets to match the\nneeds of the SPE investors or\nto limit or change the credit\nrisk of the SPE. Citigroup may\nbe the provider of certain\ncredit enhancements as well as\nthe counterparty to any\nrelated derivative contracts.\nMost of Citigroup\u2019s SPEs are\nvariable interest entities\n(VIEs), as described below.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are entities that have\neither a total equity\ninvestment that is\ninsufficient to permit the\nentity to finance its\nactivities without additional\nsubordinated financial support\nor whose equity investors lack\nthe characteristics of a\ncontrolling financial interest\n(i.e., ability to make\nsignificant decisions through\nvoting rights or similar\nrights and a right to receive\nthe expected residual returns\nof the entity or an obligation\nto absorb the expected losses\nof the entity). Investors that\nfinance the VIE through debt\nor equity interests or other\ncounterparties providing other\nforms of support, such as\nguarantees, certain fee\narrangements or certain types\nof derivative contracts, are\nvariable interest holders in\nthe entity.\n\nThe variable interest holder,\nif any, that has a controlling\nfinancial interest in a VIE is\ndeemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary and must\nconsolidate the VIE. Citigroup\nwould be deemed to have a\ncontrolling financial interest\nand be the primary beneficiary\nif it has both of the\nfollowing characteristics: \u2022\npower to direct the activities\nof the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the\nentity\u2019s economic performance;\nand \u2022 an obligation to absorb\nlosses of the entity that\ncould potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE, or a\nright to receive benefits from\nthe entity that could\npotentially be significant to\nthe VIE. The Company must\nevaluate each VIE to\nunderstand the purpose and\ndesign of the entity, the role\nthe Company had in the\nentity\u2019s design and its\ninvolvement in the VIE\u2019s\nongoing activities. The\nCompany then must evaluate\nwhich activities most\nsignificantly impact the\neconomic performance of the\nVIE and who has the power to\ndirect such activities. For\nthose VIEs where the Company\ndetermines that it has the\npower to direct the activities\nthat most significantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, the Company must\nthen evaluate its economic\ninterests, if any, and\ndetermine whether it could\nabsorb losses or receive\nbenefits that could\npotentially be significant to\nthe VIE. When evaluating\nwhether the Company has an\nobligation to absorb losses\nthat could potentially be\nsignificant, it considers the\nmaximum exposure to such loss\nwithout consideration of\nprobability. Such obligations\ncould be in various forms,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ndebt and equity investments,\nguarantees, liquidity\nagreements and certain\nderivative contracts. In\nvarious other transactions,\nthe Company may (i) act as a\nderivative counterparty (for\nexample, interest rate swap,\ncross-currency swap or\npurchaser of credit protection\nunder a credit default swap or\ntotal return swap where the\nCompany pays the total return\non certain assets to the SPE),\n(ii) act as underwriter or\nplacement agent, (iii) provide\nadministrative, trustee or\nother services or (iv) make a\nmarket in debt securities or\nother instruments issued by\nVIEs.

of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 78billion and $\n69billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 425million and $\n711million in maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2020\nand 2019, respectively.\n                              231                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s\nmaximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $ 57billion\nand $ 52.5billion, respectively (for more information on these\npositions, see Notes 14 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which\nthe Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments\nare made on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage-\nand asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Notes 13 and 24 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements); \u2022 certain representations\nand warranties exposures in legacy ICG -sponsored mortgage- and\nasset-backed securitizations in which the Company has no\nvariable interest or continuing involvement as servicer. The\noutstanding balance of mortgage loans securitized during 2005 to\n2008 in which the Company has no variable interest or continuing\ninvolvement as servicer was approximately $ 5.22billion and $\n6billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively; \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have\na variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the legal form of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the Company\u2019s standard accounting policies for the\nasset type and line of business. The asset balances for\nunconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant\ninvolvement represent the most current information available to\nthe Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an\namortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair\nvalue information is readily available to the Company. The\nmaximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying\namount of the Company\u2019s investment in the VIE. It reflects the\ninitial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any\naccrued interest and cash principal payments received. The\ncarrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines\nin fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings.\nThe maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the\nremaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and\ncredit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount\nof a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest.\nIn certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative\ninstruments or other arrangements that are not considered\nvariable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit\nprotection under a credit default swap or total return swap\nwhere the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the\nSPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in\nthe maximum exposure amounts.\n                              232                               \nFunding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated\nVIEs\u2014Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments\nThe following table presents the notional amount of liquidity\nfacilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding\ncommitments in the VIE tables above:\n                                                                \n               Decemb\u2026                    Decemb\u2026               \n                   31,                        31,               \n                  2020                       2019               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  milli\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026  \n  of           facili\u2026       commi\u2026       facili\u2026       commi\u2026  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Non-a\u2026                                                        \n  mortg\u2026    $        \u2014    $       2    $        \u2014    $       \u2014  \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  Asset\u2026             \u2014        9,114             \u2014        9,524  \n  finan\u2026                                                        \n  Munic\u2026                                                        \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  tender                                                        \n  option         1,611            \u2014         3,544            \u2014  \n  bond                                                          \n  trusts                                                        \n  (TOBs)                                                        \n  Munic\u2026             \u2014        3,041             \u2014        3,034  \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  Inves\u2026             \u2014           15             \u2014           16  \n  funds                                                         \n  Other              \u2014            \u2014             \u2014           39  \n  Total                                                         \n  fundi\u2026    $    1,611    $  12,172    $    3,544    $  12,613  \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \nConsolidated VIEs The Company engages in on-balance sheet\nsecuritizations, which are securitizations that do not qualify\nfor sales treatment; thus, the assets remain on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are\nrecognized as secured liabilities. The consolidated VIEs\nrepresent more than a hundred separate entities with which the\nCompany is involved. In general, the third-party investors in\nthe obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to\nthe assets of the respective VIEs and do not have such recourse\nto the Company, except where Citi has provided a guarantee to\nthe investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative\ntransactions involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup\u2019s maximum legal\nexposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs is significantly\nless than the carrying value of the consolidated VIE assets due\nto outstanding third-party financing. Intercompany assets and\nliabilities are excluded from Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAll VIE assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as\ncollateral. The cash flows from these assets are the only source\nused to pay down the associated liabilities, which are non-\nrecourse to Citi\u2019s general assets. See the Consolidated Balance\nSheet for more information about these Consolidated VIE assets\nand liabilities.\n\nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of           December 31,           December 31,  \n  dollars                          2020                   2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash               $                \u2014    $                 \u2014  \n  Trading account                   2.0                    2.6  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                      10.6                    9.9  \n  Total loans,                                                  \n  net of                           29.3                   26.7  \n  allowance                                                     \n  Other                             0.3                    0.5  \n  Total assets       $             42.2    $              39.7  \n                                                                \n                              233                               \nCredit Card Securitizations The Company securitizes credit card\nreceivables through trusts established to purchase the\nreceivables. Citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on\na non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving\nsecuritizations: as customers pay their credit card balances,\nthe cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and\nreplenish the receivables in the trust. Substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s credit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Master Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial\nmajority through the Master Trust. These trusts are consolidated\nentities because, as servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct\nthe activities that most significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts. Citigroup holds a seller\u2019s interest\nand certain securities issued by the trusts, which could result\nin exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from\nthe trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables\nremain on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet with nogain or loss\nrecognized. The debt issued by the trusts to third parties is\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citi utilizes\nsecuritizations as one of the sources of funding for its\nbusiness in North America .

Once\noriginated, the Company often securitizes these loans through\nthe use of VIEs. These VIEs are funded through the issuance of\ntrust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets.\nThese certificates have the same life as the transferred assets.\nIn addition to providing a source of liquidity and less\nexpensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces Citi\u2019s\ncredit exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan\nsecuritizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers\nof the securities issued by the trust. Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer\nmortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in\ncertain instances retains investment securities, interest-only\nstrips and residual interests in future cash flows from the\ntrusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of ICG\nsecuritizations. Citi\u2019s ICG business may hold investment\nsecurities pursuant to credit risk retention rules or in\nconnection with secondary market-making activities. The Company\nsecuritizes mortgage loans generally through either a U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or\nFreddie Mac (U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages), or private label\n(non-agency-sponsored mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the\nprimary beneficiary of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage\nsecuritization entities because Citigroup does not have the\npower to direct the activities of the VIEs that most\nsignificantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance.\nTherefore, Citi does not consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored\nmortgage securitization entities. Substantially all of the\nconsumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated\ntrusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans.\nRetained interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage\nsecuritization trusts are classified as Trading account assets ,\nexcept for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on\nCitigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citigroup does not\nconsolidate certain non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitization\nentities because Citi is either not the servicer with the power\nto direct the significant activities of the entity or Citi is\nthe servicer, but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a\nfiduciary relationship; therefore, Citi is not deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary of the entity. In certain instances, the\nCompany has (i) the power to direct the activities and (ii) the\nobligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive\nbenefits that could be potentially significant to its non-\nagency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities and,\ntherefore, is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates\nthe VIE.\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information\nand retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage\nsecuritizations:\n                                                                \n          2\u2026                20\u2026                20\u2026              \n  \u2026       U\u2026                U.\u2026                U.\u2026              \n  \u2026       a\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026     \n  \u2026       s\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026     \n  \u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  9\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  5.3    $  1\u2026    $  4.0    $  5\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       1\u2026       1\u2026       5.5       1\u2026       4.2       7\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       0.1        \u2014       0.1           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       0.2        \u2014       0.2           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n                                                                \nNote: Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(1) The proceeds from new securitizations in 2019 include $\n0.2billion related to personal loan securitizations.\nFor non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities where the\ntransfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for sale\naccounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the\ndifference between the carrying value of the transferred assets\nand the proceeds received (generally cash but may be beneficial\ninterests or servicing rights).

The MSRs\ncorrespond to principal loan\nbalances of $ 53billion and $\n58billion as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs:\n                                                              \n  In millions of dollars                     2020       2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance, beginning of year              $   495    $   584  \n  Originations                                123         70  \n  Changes in fair value of MSRs due to       -204        -84  \n  changes in inputs and assumptions                           \n  Other changes(1)                            -78        -75  \n  Sale of MSRs                                  \u2014          \u2014  \n  Balance, as of December 31              $   336    $   495  \n                                                              \n(1) Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of\ntime.\nThe fair value of the MSRs is\nprimarily affected by changes\nin prepayments of mortgages\nthat result from shifts in\nmortgage interest rates.\nSpecifically, higher interest\nrates tend to lead to\ndeclining prepayments, which\ncauses the fair value of the\nMSRs to increase. In managing\nthis risk, Citigroup\neconomically hedges a\nsignificant portion of the\nvalue of its MSRs through the\nuse of interest rate\nderivative contracts, forward\npurchase and sale commitments\nof mortgage-backed securities\nand purchased securities, all\nclassified as Trading account\nassets .\nThe Company receives fees during the course of servicing\npreviously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were\nas follows:\n                                                               \n  In millions of dollars       2020       2019        2018     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Servicing fees            $   142    $   148     $   172     \n  Late fees                       5             8           4  \n  Ancillary fees                  \u2014             1           8  \n  Total MSR fees            $   147    $   157     $   184     \n                                                               \nIn the Consolidated Statement\nof Income these fees are\nprimarily classified as\nCommissions and fees , and\nchanges in MSR fair values are\nclassified as Other revenue .\nRe-securitizations The Company\nengages in re-securitization\ntransactions in which debt\nsecurities are transferred to\na VIE in exchange for new\nbeneficial interests. Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThese securities are\n\nbacked by either residential\nor commercial mortgages and\nare often structured on behalf\nof clients. As of December 31,\n2020 and December 31, 2019,\nCiti held no retained\ninterests in private label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During\nthe years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2019, Citi\ntransferred agency securities\nwith a fair value of\napproximately $ 42.8billion\nand $ 31.9billion,\nrespectively, to re-\nsecuritization entities. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, the fair\nvalue of Citi-retained\ninterests in agency re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.6billion\n(including $ 916million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2020)\ncompared to $ 2.2billion as of\nDecember 31, 2019 (including $\n1.3billion related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2019), which is\nrecorded in Trading account\nassets . The original fair\nvalue of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019 was\napproximately $ 83.6billion\nand $ 73.5billion,\nrespectively. As of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, the Company\ndid not consolidate any\nprivate label or agency re-\nsecuritization entities. Citi-\nAdministered Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Conduits The\nCompany is active in the\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduit business as\nadministrator of several\nmulti-seller commercial paper\nconduits and also as a service\nprovider to single-seller and\nother commercial paper\nconduits sponsored by third\nparties. Citi\u2019s multi-seller\ncommercial paper conduits are\ndesigned to provide the\nCompany\u2019s clients access to\nlow-cost funding in the\ncommercial paper markets. The\nconduits purchase assets from\nor provide financing\nfacilities to clients and are\nfunded by issuing commercial\npaper to third-party\ninvestors. The conduits\ngenerally do not purchase\nassets originated by Citi. The\nfunding of the conduits is\nfacilitated by the liquidity\nsupport and credit\nenhancements provided by the\nCompany. As administrator to\nCiti\u2019s conduits, the Company\nis generally responsible for\nselecting and structuring\nassets purchased or financed\nby the conduits, making\ndecisions regarding the\nfunding of the conduits,\nincluding determining the\ntenor and other features of\nthe commercial paper issued,\nmonitoring the quality and\nperformance of the conduits\u2019\nassets and facilitating the\noperations and cash flows of\nthe conduits. In return, the\nCompany earns structuring fees\nfrom customers for individual\ntransactions and earns an\nadministration fee from the\nconduit, which is equal to the\nincome from the client program\nand liquidity fees of the\nconduit after payment of\nconduit expenses. This\nadministration fee is fairly\nstable, since most risks and\nrewards of the underlying\nassets are passed back to the\nclients. Once the asset\npricing is negotiated, most\nongoing income, costs and fees\nare relatively stable as a\npercentage of the conduit\u2019s\nsize. The conduits\nadministered by Citi do not\ngenerally invest in liquid\nsecurities that are formally\nrated by third parties. The\nassets are privately\nnegotiated and structured\ntransactions that\n                              238                               \nare generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than\nactively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on\neach asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper\nissued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the\nclient. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with\ntransaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by the\nthird-party client seller, including over-collateralization,\ncash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or\nthird-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with\nthe objective of approximating a credit rating of A or above,\nbased on Citi\u2019s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 2020 and\n2019, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had\napproximately $ 16.7billion and $ 15.6billion of purchased\nassets outstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding\ncommitments with clients of approximately $ 17.1billion and $\n16.3billion, respectively. Substantially all of the funding of\nthe conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted average remaining lives\nof the commercial paper issued by the conduits were\napproximately 54and 49days, respectively. The primary credit\nenhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of\ntransaction-specific credit enhancements described above. In\naddition to the transaction-specific credit enhancements, the\nconduits, other than the government guaranteed loan conduit,\nhave obtained a letter of credit from the Company, which is\nequal to at least 8% to 10% of the conduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The letters of credit provided by the\nCompany to the conduits total approximately $ 1.5billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and $ 1.4billion as of December 31, 2019. The\nnet result across multi-seller conduits administered by the\nCompany is that, in the event that defaulted assets exceed the\ntransaction-specific credit enhancements described above, any\nlosses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and\nthen to the commercial paper investors. Citigroup also provides\nthe conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are\nused to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market\ndisruption, among other events. Each asset of the conduits is\nsupported by a transaction-specific liquidity facility in the\nform of an asset purchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the\nCompany has generally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible\nreceivables from the conduit at par. The APA is not designed to\nprovide credit support to the conduit, as it generally does not\npermit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any funding\nunder the APA will likely subject the underlying conduit clients\nto increased interest costs. In addition, the Company provides\nthe conduits with program-wide liquidity in the form of short-\nterm lending commitments. Under these commitments, the Company\nhas agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a short-term\ndisruption in the commercial paper market, subject to specified\nconditions. The Company receives fees for providing both types\nof liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair\nmarket terms. Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in\nthe commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-\nbased fee for providing such services. Along with third-party\ndealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper and\nmay from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a\nthird party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the\nmarket, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper\nissued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as\nconduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the\nnormal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper,\nincluding commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company owned $ 6.6billion and $\n5.5billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits. The Company\u2019s investments were not driven\nby market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any\nagreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the\nconduits. The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are\nconsolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, through\nits roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has the\npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact\nthe entities\u2019 economic performance. These powers include its\nability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the\nconduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation\nactivities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the\nconduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result\nof all the Company\u2019s involvement described above, it was\nconcluded that Citi has an economic interest that could\npotentially be significant. However, the assets and liabilities\nof the conduits are separate and apart from those of Citigroup.\nNo assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors\nof Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries. Collateralized\nLoan Obligations (CLOs) A collateralized loan obligation (CLO)\nis a VIE that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting\nprimarily of non-investment grade corporate loans. CLOs issue\nmultiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the\nasset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming\nthe CLO. A third-party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to\npurchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor\nthe credit risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a\nCLO, the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in\na manner consistent with the CLO\u2019s asset management agreement\nand indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager will have the\npower to direct the activities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the CLO.\nInvestors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt and/or\nequity in it, can also direct certain activities of the CLO,\nincluding removing its asset manager under limited\ncircumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on\namendments to the CLO\u2019s operating documents and other\nactivities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12years. Citi\nserves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the\nCLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the CLOs are sold to\nthird-party investors. On occasion, certain Citi entities may\npurchase some portion of a CLO\u2019s liabilities for investment\npurposes. In addition, Citi may purchase, typically in the\nsecondary market, certain securities issued by the CLOs to\nsupport its market making activities. The Company generally does\nnot have the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the CLOs, as\nthis power is generally held by a third-party asset manager of\nthe CLO. As such, those CLOs are not consolidated.\n                              239                               \nThe following tables summarize\nselected cash flow information\nand retained interests related\nto Citigroup CLOs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of dollars            2020       2019       2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Principal securitized          $   0.1    $  \u2014       $     \u2014  \n  Proceeds from new                  0.1       \u2014             \u2014  \n  securitizations                                               \n  Cash flows received on                                        \n  retained                             \u2014       \u2014           0.1  \n  interests and other net                                       \n  cash flows                                                    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millions                                                      \n  of                Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,  \n  dollars               2020             2019             2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying                                                      \n  value of     $       1,611    $       1,404    $       3,142  \n  retained                                                      \n  interests                                                     \n                                                                \nAll of Citi\u2019s retained\ninterests were held-to-\nmaturity securities as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAsset-Based Financing The\nCompany provides loans and\nother forms of financing to\nVIEs that hold assets.

TOB trusts are\ntypically structured as\nsingle-issuer entities whose\nassets are purchased from\neither the Company or from\nother investors in the\nmunicipal securities market.\nTOB trusts finance the\npurchase of their municipal\nassets by issuing two classes\nof certificates: long-dated,\nfloating rate certificates\n(\u201cFloaters\u201d) that are putable\npursuant to a liquidity\nfacility and residual interest\ncertificates (\u201cResiduals\u201d).\nThe Floaters are purchased by\nthird-party investors,\ntypically tax-exempt money\nmarket funds. The Residuals\nare purchased by the original\nowner of the municipal\nsecurities that are being\nfinanced. From Citigroup\u2019s\nperspective, there are\ntwotypes of TOB trusts:\ncustomer and non-customer.\nCustomer TOB trusts are those\ntrusts utilized by customers\nof the Company to finance\ntheir securities, generally\nmunicipal securities. The\nResiduals issued by these\ntrusts are purchased by the\ncustomer being financed. Non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are\ngenerally used by the Company\nto finance its own municipal\nsecurities investments; the\nResiduals issued by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are\npurchased by the Company. With\nrespect to both customer and\nnon-customer TOB trusts, Citi\nmay provide remarketing agent\nservices. If Floaters are\noptionally tendered and the\nCompany, in its role as\nremarketing agent, is unable\nto find a new investor to\npurchase the optionally\ntendered Floaters within a\nspecified period of time,\nCitigroup may, but is not\nobligated to, purchase the\ntendered Floaters into its own\ninventory. The level of the\nCompany\u2019s inventory of such\nFloaters fluctuates. For\ncertain customer TOB trusts,\nCiti may also serve as a\nvoluntary advance provider. In\nthis capacity, the Company\nmay, but is not obligated to,\nmake loan advances to customer\nTOB trusts to purchase\noptionally tendered Floaters\nthat have not otherwise been\nsuccessfully remarketed to new\ninvestors. Such loans are\nsecured by pledged Floaters.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Citi\nhad no outstanding voluntary\nadvances to customer TOB\ntrusts. For certain non-\ncustomer trusts, the Company\nalso provides credit\nenhancement. At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, noneof the\nmunicipal bonds owned by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts were\nsubject to a credit guarantee\nprovided by the Company.\nCitigroup also provides\nliquidity services to many\ncustomer and non-customer\ntrusts. If a trust is unwound\nearly due to an event other\nthan a credit event on the\nunderlying municipal bonds,\nthe underlying municipal bonds\nare sold out of the trust and\nbond sale proceeds are used to\nredeem the outstanding trust\ncertificates. If this results\nin a shortfall between the\nbond sale proceeds and the\nredemption price of the\ntendered Floaters, the\nCompany, pursuant to the\nliquidity agreement, would be\nobligated to make a payment to\nthe trust to satisfy that\nshortfall. For certain\ncustomer TOB trusts, Citigroup\nhas also executed a\nreimbursement agreement with\nthe holder of the Residual,\npursuant to which the Residual\nholder is obligated to\nreimburse the Company for any\npayment the Company makes\nunder the liquidity\narrangement. These\nreimbursement agreements may\nbe subject to daily margining\nbased on changes in the market\nvalue of the underlying\n                              240                               \nmunicipal bonds. In cases\nwhere a third party provides\nliquidity to a non-customer\nTOB trust, a similar\nreimbursement arrangement may\nbe executed, whereby the\nCompany (or a consolidated\nsubsidiary of the Company), as\nResidual holder, would absorb\nany losses incurred by the\nliquidity provider. For\ncertain other non-customer TOB\ntrusts, Citi serves as tender\noption provider. The tender\noption provider arrangement\nallows Floater holders to put\ntheir interests directly to\nthe Company at any time,\nsubject to the requisite\nnotice period requirements, at\na price of par. At December\n31, 2020 and 2019, liquidity\nagreements provided with\nrespect to customer TOB trusts\ntotaled $ 1.6billion and $\n3.5billion, respectively, of\nwhich $ 0.8billion and $\n1.6billion, respectively, were\noffset by reimbursement\nagreements. For the remaining\nexposure related to TOB\ntransactions, where the\nresidual owned by the customer\nwas at least 25% of the bond\nvalue at the inception of the\ntransaction, no reimbursement\nagreement was executed. Citi\nconsiders both customer and\nnon-customer TOB trusts to be\nVIEs. Customer TOB trusts are\nnot consolidated by the\nCompany, as the power to\ndirect the activities that\nmost significantly impact the\ntrust\u2019s economic performance\nrests with the customer\nResidual holder, which may\nunilaterally cause the sale of\nthe trust\u2019s bonds. Non-\ncustomer TOB trusts generally\nare consolidated because the\nCompany holds the Residual\ninterest and thus has the\nunilateral power to cause the\nsale of the trust\u2019s bonds. The\nCompany also provides other\nliquidity agreements or\nletters of credit to customer-\nsponsored municipal investment\nfunds, which are not variable\ninterest entities, and\nmunicipality-related issuers\nthat totaled $ 3.6billion as\nof December 31, 2020 and $\n7.0billion as of December 31,\n2019. These liquidity\nagreements and letters of\ncredit are offset by\nreimbursement agreements with\nvarious term-out provisions.\nMunicipal Investments\nMunicipal investment\ntransactions include debt and\nequity interests in\npartnerships that finance the\nconstruction and\nrehabilitation of low-income\nhousing, facilitate lending in\nnew or underserved markets or\nfinance the construction or\noperation of renewable\nmunicipal energy facilities.\nCiti generally invests in\nthese partnerships as a\nlimited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the\nreceipt of tax credits and\ngrants earned from the\ninvestments made by the\npartnership. The Company may\nalso provide construction\nloans or permanent loans for\nthe development or operation\nof real estate properties held\nby partnerships. These\nentities are generally\nconsidered VIEs. The power to\ndirect the activities of these\nentities is typically held by\nthe general partner.\nAccordingly, these entities\nare not consolidated by\nCitigroup. Client\nIntermediation Client\nintermediation transactions\nrepresent a range of\ntransactions designed to\nprovide investors with\nspecified returns based on the\nreturns of an underlying\nsecurity, referenced asset or\nindex. These transactions\ninclude credit-linked notes\nand equity-linked notes. In\nthese transactions, the VIE\ntypically obtains exposure to\nthe underlying security,\nreferenced asset or index\nthrough a derivative\ninstrument, such\n\nas a total-return swap or a\ncredit-default swap. In turn,\nthe VIE issues notes to\ninvestors that pay a return\nbased on the specified\nunderlying security,\nreferenced asset or index. The\nVIE invests the proceeds in a\nfinancial asset or a\nguaranteed insurance contract\nthat serves as collateral for\nthe derivative contract over\nthe term of the transaction.\nThe Company\u2019s involvement in\nthese transactions includes\nbeing the counterparty to the\nVIE\u2019s derivative instruments\nand investing in a portion of\nthe notes issued by the VIE.\nIn certain transactions, the\ninvestor\u2019s maximum risk of\nloss is limited and the\nCompany absorbs risk of loss\nabove a specified level. Citi\ndoes not have the power to\ndirect the activities of the\nVIEs that most significantly\nimpact their economic\nperformance and thus it does\nnot consolidate them. Citi\u2019s\nmaximum risk of loss in these\ntransactions is defined as the\namount invested in notes\nissued by the VIE and the\nnotional amount of any risk of\nloss absorbed by Citi through\na separate instrument issued\nby the VIE. The derivative\ninstrument held by the Company\nmay generate a receivable from\nthe VIE (for example, where\nthe Company purchases credit\nprotection from the VIE in\nconnection with the VIE\u2019s\nissuance of a credit-linked\nnote), which is collateralized\nby the assets owned by the\nVIE. These derivative\ninstruments are not considered\nvariable interests and any\nassociated receivables are not\nincluded in the calculation of\nmaximum exposure to the VIE.\nInvestment Funds The Company\nis the investment manager for\ncertain investment funds and\nretirement funds that invest\nin various asset classes\nincluding private equity,\nhedge funds, real estate,\nfixed income and\ninfrastructure. Citigroup\nearns a management fee, which\nis a percentage of capital\nunder management, and may earn\nperformance fees. In addition,\nfor some of these funds the\nCompany has an ownership\ninterest in the investment\nfunds. Citi has also\nestablished a number of\ninvestment funds as\nopportunities for qualified\ncolleagues to invest in\nprivate equity investments.\nThe Company acts as investment\nmanager for these funds and\nmay provide colleagues with\nfinancing on both recourse and\nnon-recourse bases for a\nportion of the colleagues\u2019\ninvestment commitments.\n                              241                               \n                                                                \n  22. DERIVATIVES                                               \n                                                                \nIn the ordinary course of\nbusiness, Citigroup enters\ninto various types of\nderivative transactions, which\ninclude: \u2022 Futures and forward\ncontracts , which are\ncommitments to buy or sell at\na future date a financial\ninstrument, commodity or\ncurrency at a contracted price\nthat may be settled in cash or\nthrough delivery of an item\nreadily convertible to cash. \u2022\nSwap contracts , which are\ncommitments to settle in cash\nat a future date or dates that\nmay range from a few days to a\nnumber of years, based on\ndifferentials between\nspecified indices or financial\ninstruments, as applied to a\nnotional principal amount. \u2022\nOption contracts , which give\nthe purchaser, for a premium,\nthe right, but not the\nobligation, to buy or sell\nwithin a specified time a\nfinancial instrument,\ncommodity or currency at a\ncontracted price that may also\nbe settled in cash, based on\ndifferentials between\nspecified indices or prices.\nSwaps, forwards and some\noption contracts are over-the-\ncounter (OTC) derivatives that\nare bilaterally negotiated\nwith counterparties and\nsettled with those\ncounterparties, except for\nswap contracts that are\nnovated and \"cleared\" through\ncentral counterparties (CCPs).\nFutures contracts and other\noption contracts are\nstandardized contracts that\nare traded on an exchange with\na CCP as the counterparty from\nthe inception of the\ntransaction. Citigroup enters\ninto derivative contracts\nrelating to interest rate,\nforeign currency, commodity\nand other market/credit risks\nfor the following reasons: \u2022\nTrading Purposes : Citigroup\ntrades derivatives as an\nactive market maker. Citigroup\noffers its customers\nderivatives in connection with\ntheir risk management actions\nto transfer, modify or reduce\ntheir interest rate, foreign\nexchange and other\nmarket/credit risks or for\ntheir own trading purposes.\nCitigroup also manages its\nderivative risk positions\nthrough offsetting trade\nactivities, controls focused\non price verification and\ndaily reporting of positions\nto senior managers. \u2022 Hedging\n: Citigroup uses derivatives\nin connection with its own\nrisk management activities to\nhedge certain risks or\nreposition the risk profile of\nthe Company. Hedging may be\naccomplished by applying hedge\naccounting in accordance with\nASC 815, Derivatives and\nHedging , or by an economic\nhedge. For example, Citigroup\nissues fixed-rate long-term\ndebt and then enters into a\nreceive-fixed, pay-variable-\nrate interest rate swap with\nthe same tenor and notional\namount to synthetically\nconvert the interest payments\nto a net variable-rate basis.\nThis strategy is the most\ncommon form of an interest\nrate hedge, as it minimizes\nnet interest cost in certain\nyield curve environments.\nDerivatives are also used to\nmanage market risks inherent\nin specific groups of on-\nbalance sheet assets and\nliabilities, including AFS\nsecurities, commodities and\nborrowings, as well as other\ninterest-sensitive assets and\nliabilities. In addition,\nforeign exchange contracts are\nused to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-\n\ndenominated debt, foreign\ncurrency-denominated AFS\nsecurities and net investment\nexposures. Derivatives may\nexpose Citigroup to market,\ncredit or liquidity risks in\nexcess of the amounts recorded\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Market risk on a\nderivative product is the\nexposure created by potential\nfluctuations in interest\nrates, market prices, foreign\nexchange rates and other\nfactors and is a function of\nthe type of product, the\nvolume of transactions, the\ntenor and terms of the\nagreement and the underlying\nvolatility. Credit risk is the\nexposure to loss in the event\nof nonperformance by the other\nparty to satisfy a derivative\nliability where the value of\nany collateral held by Citi is\nnot adequate to cover such\nlosses. The recognition in\nearnings of unrealized gains\non derivative transactions is\nsubject to management\u2019s\nassessment of the probability\nof counterparty default.\nLiquidity risk is the\npotential exposure that arises\nwhen the size of a derivative\nposition may affect the\nability to monetize the\nposition in a reasonable\nperiod of time and at a\nreasonable cost in periods of\nhigh volatility and financial\nstress. Derivative\ntransactions are customarily\ndocumented under industry\nstandard master netting\nagreements, which provide that\nfollowing an event of default,\nthe non-defaulting party may\npromptly terminate all\ntransactions between the\nparties and determine the net\namount due to be paid to, or\nby, the defaulting party.\nEvents of default include (i)\nfailure to make a payment on a\nderivative transaction that\nremains uncured following\napplicable notice and grace\nperiods, (ii) breach of\nagreement that remains uncured\nafter applicable notice and\ngrace periods, (iii) breach of\na representation, (iv) cross\ndefault, either to third-party\ndebt or to other derivative\ntransactions entered into\nbetween the parties, or, in\nsome cases, their affiliates,\n(v) the occurrence of a merger\nor consolidation that results\nin a party\u2019s becoming a\nmaterially weaker credit and\n(vi) the cessation or\nrepudiation of any applicable\nguarantee or other credit\nsupport document. Obligations\nunder master netting\nagreements are often secured\nby collateral posted under an\nindustry standard credit\nsupport annex to the master\nnetting agreement. An event of\ndefault may also occur under a\ncredit support annex if a\nparty fails to make a\ncollateral delivery that\nremains uncured following\napplicable notice and grace\nperiods. The netting and\ncollateral rights incorporated\nin the master netting\nagreements are considered to\nbe legally enforceable if a\nsupportive legal opinion has\nbeen obtained from counsel of\nrecognized standing that\nprovides (i) the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding\nenforceability and (ii) that\nthe exercise of rights by the\nnon-defaulting party to\nterminate and close-out\ntransactions on a net basis\nunder these agreements will\nnot be stayed or avoided under\napplicable law upon an event\nof default, including\nbankruptcy, insolvency or\nsimilar proceeding. A legal\nopinion may not be sought for\ncertain jurisdictions where\nlocal law is silent or unclear\nas to the enforceability of\nsuch rights or where adverse\ncase law or conflicting\nregulation may cast doubt on\nthe enforceability of such\nrights. In some jurisdictions\nand for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law may\nnot provide the requisite\nlevel of certainty. For\n                              242                               \nexample, this may be the case\nfor certain sovereigns,\nmunicipalities, central banks\nand U.S. pension plans.\nExposure to credit risk on\nderivatives is affected by\nmarket volatility, which may\nimpair the ability of\ncounterparties to satisfy\ntheir obligations to the\nCompany. Credit limits are\nestablished and closely\nmonitored for customers\nengaged in derivatives\ntransactions. Citi considers\nthe level of legal certainty\nregarding enforceability of\nits offsetting rights under\nmaster netting agreements and\ncredit support annexes to be\nan important factor in its\nrisk management process.\nSpecifically, Citi generally\ntransacts much lower volumes\nof derivatives under master\nnetting agreements where Citi\ndoes not have the requisite\nlevel of legal certainty\nregarding enforceability,\nbecause such derivatives\nconsume greater amounts of\nsingle counterparty credit\nlimits than those executed\nunder enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Cash\ncollateral and security\ncollateral in the form of G10\ngovernment debt securities are\noften posted by a party to a\nmaster netting agreement to\nsecure the net open exposure\nof the other party; the\nreceiving party is free to\ncommingle/rehypothecate such\ncollateral in the ordinary\ncourse of its business.\nNonstandard collateral such as\ncorporate bonds, municipal\nbonds, U.S. agency securities\nand/or MBS may also be pledged\nas collateral for derivative\ntransactions. Security\ncollateral posted to open and\nmaintain a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty,\nin the form of cash and/or\nsecurities, may from time to\ntime be segregated in an\naccount at a third-party\ncustodian pursuant to a tri-\nparty account control\nagreement. As of January 1,\n2018, Citigroup early adopted\nASU 2017-12, Targeted\nImprovements to Accounting for\nHedging Activities . This\nstandard primarily impacts\nCiti\u2019s accounting for\nderivatives designated as cash\nflow hedges and fair value\nhedges. Refer to the\nrespective sections below for\ndetails.\n                              243                               \nInformation pertaining to Citigroup\u2019s derivative activities,\nbased on notional amounts, is presented in the table below.\nDerivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which\ncontractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to derivative transactions. Citi\u2019s\nderivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations\n(i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk)\nand/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e.,\nliquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments\nthat may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional\namounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap\nwith $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an\nidentical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different\ncounterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting positions may result in de minimis\noverall market risk. In addition, aggregate derivative notional\namounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course\nof business based on Citi\u2019s market share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors. All derivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading account liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nDerivative Notionals\n

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              244                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\nGross positive fair values are\noffset against gross negative\nfair values by counterparty,\npursuant to enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. As a\nresult, the tables reflect a\nreduction of approximately $\n280billion and $ 180billion as\nof December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, of derivative\nassets and derivative\nliabilities that previously\nwould have been reported on a\ngross basis, but are now\nlegally settled and not\nsubject to collateral. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              245

As a\ngeneral rule, hedge accounting\nis permitted where the Company\nis exposed to a particular\nrisk, such as interest rate or\nforeign exchange risk, that\ncauses changes in the fair\nvalue of an asset or liability\nor variability in the expected\nfuture cash flows of an\nexisting asset, liability or a\nforecasted transaction that\nmay affect earnings.\nDerivative contracts hedging\nthe risks associated with\nchanges in fair value are\nreferred to as fair value\nhedges, while contracts\nhedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are\ncash flow hedges. Hedges that\nutilize derivatives or debt\ninstruments to manage the\nforeign exchange risk\nassociated with equity\ninvestments in\nnon-U.S.-dollar-functional-\ncurrency foreign subsidiaries\n(net investment in a foreign\noperation) are net investment\nhedges. To qualify as an\naccounting hedge under the\nhedge accounting rules (versus\nan economic hedge where hedge\naccounting is not applied), a\nhedging relationship must be\nhighly effective in offsetting\nthe risk designated as being\nhedged. The hedging\nrelationship must be formally\ndocumented at inception,\ndetailing the particular risk\nmanagement objective and\nstrategy for the hedge. This\nincludes the item and risk(s)\nbeing hedged, the hedging\ninstrument being used and how\neffectiveness will be\nassessed. The effectiveness of\nthese hedging relationships is\nevaluated at hedge inception\nand on an ongoing basis both\non a retrospective and\nprospective basis, typically\nusing quantitative measures of\ncorrelation, with hedge\nineffectiveness measured and\nrecorded in current earnings.\nHedge effectiveness assessment\nmethodologies are performed in\na similar manner for similar\nhedges, and are used\n\nconsistently throughout the\nhedging relationships. The\nassessment of effectiveness\nmay exclude changes in the\nvalue of the hedged item that\nare unrelated to the risks\nbeing hedged and the changes\nin fair value of the\nderivative associated with\ntime value. Prior to January\n1, 2018, these excluded items\nwere recognized in current\nearnings for the hedging\nderivative, while changes in\nthe value of a hedged item\nthat were not related to the\nhedged risk were not recorded.\nUpon adoption of ASC 2017-12,\nCiti excludes changes in the\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords it in Other\ncomprehensive income .\nDiscontinued Hedge Accounting\nA hedging instrument must be\nhighly effective in\naccomplishing the hedge\nobjective of offsetting either\nchanges in the fair value or\ncash flows of the hedged item\nfor the risk being hedged.\nManagement may voluntarily de-\ndesignate an accounting hedge\nat any time, but if a hedging\nrelationship is not highly\neffective, it no longer\nqualifies for hedge accounting\nand must be de-designated.\nSubsequent changes in the fair\nvalue of the derivative are\nrecognized in Other revenue or\nPrincipal transactions ,\nsimilar to trading\nderivatives, with no offset\nrecorded related to the hedged\nitem. For fair value hedges,\nany changes in the fair value\nof the hedged item remain as\npart of the basis of the asset\nor liability and are\nultimately realized as an\nelement of the yield on the\nitem. For cash flow hedges,\nchanges in fair value of the\nend-user derivative remain in\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) and are included in the\nearnings of future periods\nwhen the forecasted hedged\ncash flows impact earnings.\nHowever, if it becomes\nprobable that some or all of\nthe hedged forecasted\ntransactions will not occur,\nany amounts that remain in\nAOCI related to these\ntransactions must be\nimmediately reflected in Other\nrevenue . The foregoing\ncriteria are applied on a\ndecentralized basis,\nconsistent with the level at\nwhich market risk is managed,\nbut are subject to various\nlimits and controls. The\nunderlying asset, liability or\nforecasted transaction may be\nan individual item or a\nportfolio of similar items.\n                              248                               \nFair Value Hedges Hedging of Benchmark Interest Rate Risk\nCitigroup\u2019s fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed-rate\nlong-term debt or assets, such as available-for-sale debt\nsecurities or loans. For qualifying fair value hedges of\ninterest rate risk, the changes in the fair value of the\nderivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are presented within Interest\nrevenue or Interest expense based on whether the hedged item is\nan asset or a liability. Citigroup has executed a last-of-layer\nhedge, which permits an entity to hedge the interest rate risk\nof a stated portion of a closed portfolio of prepayable\nfinancial assets that are expected to remain outstanding for the\ndesignated tenor of the hedge. In accordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment risk when measuring the change in\nfair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk\nunder the last-of-layer approach. Similar to other fair value\nhedges, where the hedged item is an asset, the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to interest rate risk will be presented\nin Interest revenue along with the change in the fair value of\nthe hedging instrument. Hedging of Foreign Exchange Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to\nforeign exchange rate movements in available-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt that are denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency of the entity holding the\nsecurities or issuing the debt. The hedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign exchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract. Citigroup considers the premium\nassociated with forward contracts (i.e., the differential\nbetween the spot and contractual forward rates) as the cost of\nhedging; this amount is excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally reflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in cross-\ncurrency basis associated with cross-currency swaps from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging of Commodity Price Risk Citigroup\nhedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price\nmovements in physical commodities inventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying\ncommodity. In this hedge, the change in the value of the hedged\ninventory is reflected in earnings, which offsets the change in\nthe fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change in the fair value of the hedging\ninstrument recorded in earnings includes changes in forward\nrates, Citigroup excludes the differential between the spot and\nthe contractual forward rates under the futures contract from\nthe assessment of hedge effectiveness, and it is generally\nreflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Citi\nalso excludes changes in forward rates from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and records it in Other comprehensive income\n.\n                              249

Variable cash flows from those\nliabilities are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows\nby entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps\nand receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate\nswaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are\nsynthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering\ninto receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash\nflow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or\ndollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging\nrelationships are highly effective at inception and on an\nongoing basis. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Citigroup\ndesignated the risk being hedged as the risk of overall\nvariability in the hedged cash flows for certain items. With the\nadoption of ASU 2017-12, Citigroup hedges the variability from\nchanges in a contractually specified rate and recognizes the\nentire change in fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments\nin AOCI . Prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, to the extent\nthat these derivatives were not fully effective, changes in\ntheir fair values in excess of changes in the value of the\nhedged transactions were immediately included in Other revenue .\nWith the adoption of ASU 2017-12, such amounts are no longer\nrequired to be immediately recognized in income, but instead the\nfull change in the value of the hedging instrument is required\nto be recognized in AOCI , and then recognized in earnings in\nthe same period that the cash flows impact earnings. The pretax\nchange in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  d\u2026       20\u2026                 20\u2026                20\u2026           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  I\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026    $            2,\u2026    $            7\u2026              $  -\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                 -15                 -\u2026                  5  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026    $            2,\u2026    $            7\u2026              $  -\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  g\u2026       Ot\u2026       Net       Ot\u2026       N\u2026       Ot\u2026       N\u2026  \n  (\u2026       re\u2026       in\u2026       re\u2026       i\u2026       re\u2026       i\u2026  \n  r\u2026                 re\u2026                 r\u2026                 r\u2026  \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  I\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026    $    \u2014    $  734    $    \u2014    $  -\u2026    $    \u2014    $  -\u2026  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026        -4         \u2014        -7        \u2014       -17        \u2014  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  g\u2026                                                            \n  (\u2026    $   -4    $  734    $   -7    $  -\u2026    $  -17    $  -\u2026  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  N\u2026                                                            \n  p\u2026                                                            \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  in                                                            \n  c\u2026              $  1,\u2026              $  1\u2026              $  -\u2026  \n  f\u2026                                                            \n  h\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  w\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate\ncontracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net\ninterest revenue) . For all other hedges, the amounts\nreclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue\nand Net interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the\nhedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and then reclassified\nto earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash\nflows impact earnings. The net gain (loss) associated with cash\nflow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12\nmonths of December 31, 2020 is approximately $ 920million. The\nmaximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are\nhedged is 10years. The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on\nAOCI is shown in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                              252                               \nNet Investment Hedges Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign\nCurrency Matters\u2014Foreign Currency Transactions , ASC 815 allows\nthe hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in\na foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards,\ncross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated\ndebt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated\nwith Citigroup\u2019s equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollar-\nfunctional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citigroup records the\nchange in the carrying amount of these investments in Foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment within AOCI . Simultaneously,\nthe effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also\nrecorded in Foreign currency translation adjustment and any\nineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. For\nderivatives designated as net investment hedges, Citigroup\nfollows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC 815-35-35.\nAccording to that method, all changes in fair value, including\nchanges related to the forward-rate component of the foreign\ncurrency forward contracts and the time value of foreign\ncurrency options, are recorded in Foreign currency translation\nadjustment within AOCI . For foreign currency-denominated debt\ninstruments that are designated as hedges of net investments,\nthe translation gain or loss that is recorded in Foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment is based on the spot exchange\nrate between the functional currency of the respective\nsubsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency\nof Citigroup. To the extent that the notional amount of the\nhedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment,\nand the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging\ninstrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional\ncurrency of the net investment and Citigroup\u2019s functional\ncurrency (or, in the case of a non-derivative debt instrument,\nsuch instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the\nnet investment), no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings. The\npretax gain (loss) recorded in Foreign currency translation\nadjustment within AOCI , related to net investment hedges, was\n$( 600) million, $( 569) million and $ 1,147million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEconomic Hedges Citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge\naccounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome.\nEnd-user derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at\nfair value, with changes in value included in either Principal\ntransactions or Other revenue . For asset/liability management\nhedging, fixed-rate long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost\nunder GAAP. For other hedges that either do not meet the ASC 815\nhedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply\nASC 815 hedge accounting, the derivative is recorded at fair\nvalue on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair\nvalue recorded in earnings, while the debt continues to be\ncarried at amortized cost. Therefore, current earnings are\naffected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that\ncause a change in the swap\u2019s value, but for which no offsetting\nchange in value is recorded on the debt. Citigroup may\nalternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under\nthe fair value option. Once the irrevocable election is made\nupon issuance of the debt, the full change in fair value of the\ndebt is reported in earnings. The changes in fair value of the\nrelated interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings, which\nprovides a natural offset to the debt\u2019s fair value change. To\nthe extent that the two amounts differ because the full change\nin the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the\ninterest rate swap, the difference is automatically captured in\ncurrent earnings. Additional economic hedges include hedges of\nthe credit risk component of commercial loans and loan\ncommitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging\nstrategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting\nhedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs\nand benefits. Economic hedges are also employed when the hedged\nitem itself is marked to market through current earnings, such\nas hedges of commitments to originate one- to four-family\nmortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs. Credit Derivatives Citi is a\nmarket maker and trades a range of credit derivatives. Through\nthese contracts, Citi either purchases or writes protection on\neither a single name or a portfolio of reference credits. Citi\nalso uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its\ncorporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions\nand to facilitate client transactions. Citi monitors its\ncounterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 97% and 98%,\nrespectively, of the gross receivables are from counterparties\nwith which Citi maintains collateral agreements. A majority of\nCiti\u2019s top 15counterparties (by receivable balance owed to Citi)\nare central clearing houses, banks, financial institutions or\nother dealers. Contracts with these counterparties do not\ninclude ratings-based termination events. However, counterparty\nratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering\nthe threshold at which Citi may call for additional collateral.\nThe range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit\ndefault swaps, total return swaps, credit options and credit-\nlinked notes. A credit default swap is a contract in which, for\na fee, a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection\nbuyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event\non a reference entity. These credit events are defined by the\nterms of the derivative contract and the reference credit and\nare generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay\non indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference credit and, in a\nmore limited range of transactions, debt restructuring. Credit\nderivative transactions that reference emerging market entities\nalso typically include additional credit events to cover the\nacceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a\npayment moratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be\nprovided on a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed\nsecurities. If there is no credit event, as defined by the\nspecific derivative contract, then the protection seller makes\nno payments to the protection buyer and receives only the\ncontractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs\nas defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the\nprotection seller will be required to make a payment to the\n                              253                               \nprotection buyer. Under\ncertain contracts, the seller\nof protection may not be\nrequired to make a payment\nuntil a specified amount of\nlosses has occurred with\nrespect to the portfolio\nand/or may only be required to\npay for losses up to a\nspecified amount. A total\nreturn swap typically\ntransfers the total economic\nperformance of a reference\nasset, which includes all\nassociated cash flows, as well\nas capital appreciation or\ndepreciation. The protection\nbuyer receives a floating rate\nof interest and any\ndepreciation on the reference\nasset from the protection\nseller and, in return, the\nprotection seller receives the\ncash flows associated with the\nreference asset plus any\nappreciation. Thus, according\nto the total return swap\nagreement, the protection\nseller will be obligated to\nmake a payment any time the\nfloating interest rate payment\nplus any depreciation of the\nreference asset exceeds the\ncash flows associated with the\nunderlying asset. A total\nreturn swap may terminate upon\na default of the reference\nasset or a credit event with\nrespect to the reference\nentity, subject to the\nprovisions of the related\ntotal return swap agreement\nbetween the protection seller\nand the protection buyer. A\ncredit option is a credit\nderivative that allows\ninvestors to trade or hedge\nchanges in the credit quality\nof a reference entity. For\nexample, in a credit spread\noption, the option writer\nassumes the obligation to\npurchase or sell credit\nprotection on the reference\nentity at a specified \u201cstrike\u201d\nspread level. The option\npurchaser buys the right to\nsell credit default protection\non the reference entity to, or\npurchase it from, the option\nwriter at the strike spread\nlevel. The payments on credit\nspread options depend either\non a particular credit spread\nor the price of the underlying\ncredit-sensitive asset or\nother reference entity. The\noptions usually terminate if a\ncredit event occurs with\nrespect to the underlying\nreference entity. A credit-\nlinked note is a form of\ncredit derivative structured\nas a debt security with an\nembedded credit default swap.\nThe purchaser of the note\neffectively provides credit\nprotection to the issuer by\nagreeing to receive a return\nthat could be negatively\naffected by credit events on\nthe underlying reference\ncredit. If the reference\nentity defaults, the note may\nbe cash settled or physically\nsettled by delivery of a debt\nsecurity of the reference\nentity. Thus, the maximum\namount of the note purchaser\u2019s\nexposure is the amount paid\nfor the credit-linked note.\n                              254                               \nThe following tables

                   255                               \nFair values included in the above tables are prior to\napplication of any netting agreements and cash collateral. For\nnotional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the\ntotal notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it\nmay hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into\noffsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The\nopen risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely\nmatched after certain cash positions in reference assets are\nconsidered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either to a\nduration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of\nsubordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit\nderivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to\nevaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned\ninternal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be \u201cBaa/BBB\u201d and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. Citigroup\nevaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives\nfor which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit\nrating assigned to the underlying reference credit. Credit\nderivatives written on an underlying non-investment grade\nreference credit represent greater payment risk to the Company.\nThe non-investment grade category in the table above also\nincludes credit derivatives where the underlying reference\nentity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the\nderivative. The maximum potential amount of future payments\nunder credit derivative contracts presented in the table above\nis based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company\nbelieves that the notional amount for credit protection sold is\nnot representative of the actual loss exposure based on\nhistorical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the\nvalue of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In\naccordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a\ncredit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the\ndifference between the protection sold and the value of the\nreference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit\nprotection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral\npaid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be\ncalculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any\ncredit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a\nrelated master netting agreement. Due to such netting processes,\ndetermining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit\nderivative exposures alone is not possible. The Company actively\nmonitors open credit-risk exposures and manages this exposure by\nusing a variety of strategies, including purchased credit\nderivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings of the\nreferenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured\nin the table above. Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in\nDerivatives Certain derivative instruments contain provisions\nthat require the Company to either post additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the\noccurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of\nthe Company. These events, which are defined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit\nratings of the Company and its affiliates. The fair value\n(excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-\nrelated contingent features that were in a net liability\nposition at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 25billion and\n$ 30billion, respectively. The Company posted $ 22billion and $\n28billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course\nof business as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch\nby all threemajor rating agencies as of December 31, 2020, the\nCompany could be required to post an additional $ 0.8billion as\neither collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could be required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians collateral previously received from\nexisting derivative counterparties in the amount of $ 0.2billion\nupon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral requirements of approximately $\n1billion. Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers\nThe Company executes total return swaps that provide it with\nsynthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return\nof the securities or other financial assets referenced in the\ncontract. In certain cases, the derivative transaction is\naccompanied by the Company\u2019s transfer of the referenced\nfinancial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically\nin response to the derivative counterparty\u2019s desire to hedge, in\nwhole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the derivative\ncontract by holding the referenced asset in funded form. In\ncertain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales,\nresulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndiscussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of\nfinancial assets). For a significant portion of the\ntransactions, the Company has also executed another total return\nswap where the Company passes on substantially all of the\neconomic return of the referenced securities to a different\nthird party seeking the exposure. In those cases, the Company is\nnot exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the economic return\nof the referenced securities. These transactions generally\ninvolve the transfer of the Company\u2019s liquid government bonds,\nconvertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities\nfrom the trading portfolio and are executed with third-party\nfinancial institutions. The accompanying derivatives are\ntypically total return swaps. The derivatives are cash settled\nand subject to ongoing margin requirements. When the conditions\nfor sale accounting are met, the Company reports the transfer of\nthe referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports\nthe accompanying derivative transaction. These transactions\ngenerally do not result in a gain\n                              256                               \nor loss on the sale of the\nsecurity, because the\ntransferred security was held\nat fair value in the Company\u2019s\ntrading portfolio. For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nboth the asset amounts\nderecognized and the gross\ncash proceeds received as of\nthe date of derecognition were\n$ 2.0billion and $ 5.8billion\nas of December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2020, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.2billion. The fair value of\nthe total return swaps as of\nDecember 31, 2020 was $\n135million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n7million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2019, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n5.9billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 117million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n43million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              257                               \n                                                                \n  23. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK                             \n                                                                \nConcentrations of credit risk\nexist when changes in\neconomic, industry or\ngeographic factors similarly\naffect groups of\ncounterparties whose aggregate\ncredit exposure is material in\nrelation to Citigroup\u2019s total\ncredit exposure. Although\nCitigroup\u2019s portfolio of\nfinancial instruments is\nbroadly diversified along\nindustry, product and\ngeographic lines, material\ntransactions are completed\nwith other financial\ninstitutions, particularly in\nthe securities trading,\nderivatives and foreign\nexchange businesses. In\nconnection with the Company\u2019s\nefforts to maintain a\ndiversified portfolio, the\nCompany limits its exposure to\nany one geographic region,\ncountry or individual creditor\nand monitors this exposure on\na continuous basis. At\nDecember 31, 2020, Citigroup\u2019s\nmost significant concentration\nof credit risk was with the\nU.S. government and its\nagencies. The Company\u2019s\nexposure, which primarily\nresults from trading assets\nand investments issued by the\nU.S. government and its\nagencies, amounted to $\n370.1billion and $\n250.9billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe German and Japanese\ngovernments and their\nagencies, which are rated\ninvestment grade by both\nMoody\u2019s and S&P, were the next\nlargest exposures. The\nCompany\u2019s exposure to Germany\namounted to $ 51.8billion and\n$ 29.8billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively,\nand was composed of investment\nsecurities, loans and trading\nassets. The Company\u2019s exposure\nto Japan amounted to $\n35.5billion and $ 33.3billion\nat December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and was composed\nof investment securities,\nloans and trading assets. The\nCompany\u2019s exposure to states\nand municipalities amounted to\n$ 24.4billion and $\n31.4billion at December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively,\nand was composed of trading\nassets, investment securities,\nderivatives and lending\nactivities.\n                              258                               \n                                                                \n  24. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT                                    \n                                                                \nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement , defines fair\nvalue, establishes a\nconsistent framework for\nmeasuring fair value and\nrequires disclosures about\nfair value measurements. Fair\nvalue is defined as the price\nthat would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly\ntransaction between market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date, and\ntherefore represents an exit\nprice. Among other things, the\nstandard requires the Company\nto maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs\nwhen measuring fair value.\nUnder ASC 820-10, the\nprobability of default of a\ncounterparty is factored into\nthe valuation of derivative\nand other positions as well as\nthe impact of Citigroup\u2019s own\ncredit risk on derivatives and\nother liabilities measured at\nfair value. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active, and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nsignificant value drivers are\nobservable in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived\nfrom valuation techniques in\nwhich one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers are unobservable . As\nrequired under the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe frequency of transactions,\nthe size of the bid-ask spread\nand the amount of adjustment\nnecessary when comparing\nsimilar transactions are all\nfactors in determining the\nrelevance of observed prices\nin those markets.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nFor assets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value, the\nCompany measures fair value\nusing the procedures set out\nbelow, irrespective of whether\nthe assets and liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value as a\nresult of an election or\nwhether they are required to\nbe measured at fair value.\nWhen available, the Company\nuses quoted market prices from\nactive markets to determine\nfair value and classifies such\nitems as Level 1. In some\nspecific cases where a market\nprice is available, the\nCompany will make use of\nacceptable practical\nexpedients (such as matrix\npricing) to calculate fair\nvalue, in which case the items\nare classified as Level 2. The\nCompany may also apply a\nprice-based methodology, which\nutilizes, where available,\nquoted prices or other market\ninformation obtained from\nrecent trading activity in\npositions with the same or\nsimilar characteristics to the\nposition being valued. The\nfrequency and size of\ntransactions are among the\n\nfactors that are driven by the\nliquidity of markets and\ndetermine the relevance of\nobserved prices in those\nmarkets. If relevant and\nobservable prices are\navailable, those valuations\nmay be classified as Level 2.\nWhen that is not the case, and\nthere are one or more\nsignificant unobservable\n\u201cprice\u201d inputs, then those\nvaluations will be classified\nas Level 3. Furthermore, when\na quoted price is stale, a\nsignificant adjustment to the\nprice of a similar security is\nnecessary to reflect\ndifferences in the terms of\nthe actual security or loan\nbeing valued, or prices from\nindependent sources are\ninsufficient to corroborate\nthe valuation, the \u201cprice\u201d\ninputs are considered\nunobservable and the fair\nvalue measurements are\nclassified as Level 3. If\nquoted market prices are not\navailable, fair value is based\nupon internally developed\nvaluation techniques that use,\nwhere possible, current\nmarket-based parameters, such\nas interest rates, currency\nrates and option volatilities.\nItems valued using such\ninternally generated valuation\ntechniques are classified\naccording to the lowest level\ninput or value driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified as Level 3 even\nthough there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable. Fair value\nestimates from internal\nvaluation techniques are\nverified, where possible, to\nprices obtained from\nindependent vendors or\nbrokers. Vendors\u2019 and brokers\u2019\nvaluations may be based on a\nvariety of inputs ranging from\nobserved prices to proprietary\nvaluation models, and the\nCompany assesses the quality\nand relevance of this\ninformation in determining the\nestimate of fair value. The\nfollowing section describes\nthe valuation methodologies\nused by the Company to measure\nvarious financial instruments\nat fair value, including an\nindication of the level in the\nfair value hierarchy in which\neach instrument is generally\nclassified. Where appropriate,\nthe description includes\ndetails of the valuation\nmodels, the key inputs to\nthose models and any\nsignificant assumptions.\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nGenerally, the unit of account\nfor a financial instrument is\nthe individual financial\ninstrument. The Company\napplies market valuation\nadjustments that are\nconsistent with the unit of\naccount, which does not\ninclude adjustment due to the\nsize of the Company\u2019s\nposition, except as follows.\nASC 820-10 permits an\nexception, through an\naccounting policy election, to\nmeasure the fair value of a\nportfolio of financial assets\nand financial liabilities on\nthe basis of the net open risk\nposition when certain criteria\nare met. Citi has elected to\nmeasure certain portfolios of\nfinancial instruments that\nmeet those criteria, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open risk position.\nThe Company applies market\nvaluation adjustments,\nincluding adjustments to\naccount for the size of the\nnet open risk position,\nconsistent with market\nparticipant assumptions.\nValuation adjustments are\napplied to items classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy to ensure that\nthe fair value reflects the\nprice at which the net open\nrisk position could be exited.\nThese valuation adjustments\nare based on the bid/offer\nspread for an instrument in\nthe market. When Citi has\nelected to measure certain\nportfolios of financial\ninvestments, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open\n                              259                               \nrisk position, the valuation\nadjustment may take into\naccount the size of the\nposition. Credit valuation\nadjustments (CVA) and funding\nvaluation adjustments (FVA)\nare applied to the relevant\npopulation of over-the-counter\n(OTC) derivative instruments\nwhere adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit risk, own\ncredit risk and term funding\nrisk are required to estimate\nfair value. This principally\nincludes derivatives with a\nbase valuation (e.g.,\ndiscounted using overnight\nindexed swap (OIS)) requiring\nadjustment for these effects,\nsuch as uncollateralized\ninterest rate swaps. The CVA\nrepresents a portfolio-level\nadjustment to reflect the risk\npremium associated with the\ncounterparty\u2019s (assets) or\nCiti\u2019s (liabilities) non-\nperformance risk. The FVA\nrepresents a market funding\nrisk premium inherent in the\nuncollateralized portion of a\nderivative portfolio and in\ncertain collateralized\nderivative portfolios that do\nnot include standard credit\nsupport annexes (CSAs), such\nas where the CSA does not\npermit the reuse of collateral\nreceived. Citi\u2019s FVA\nmethodology leverages the\nexisting CVA methodology to\nestimate a funding exposure\nprofile. The calculation of\nthis exposure profile\nconsiders collateral\nagreements in which the terms\ndo not permit the Company to\nreuse the collateral received,\nincluding where counterparties\npost collateral to third-party\ncustodians. Citi\u2019s CVA and FVA\nmethodology consists of two\nsteps: \u2022 First, the exposure\nprofile for each counterparty\nis determined using the terms\nof all individual derivative\npositions and a Monte Carlo\nsimulation or other\nquantitative analysis to\ngenerate a series of expected\ncash flows at future points in\ntime. The calculation of this\nexposure profile considers the\neffect of credit risk\nmitigants and sources of\nfunding, including pledged\ncash or other collateral and\nany legal right of offset that\nexists with a counterparty\nthrough arrangements such as\nnetting agreements. Individual\nderivative contracts that are\nsubject to an enforceable\nmaster netting agreement with\na counterparty are aggregated\nas a netting set for this\npurpose, since it is those\naggregate net cash flows that\nare subject to nonperformance\nrisk. This process identifies\nspecific, point-in-time future\ncash flows that are subject to\nnonperformance risk and\nunsecured funding, rather than\nusing the current recognized\nnet asset or liability as a\nbasis to measure the CVA and\nFVA. \u2022 Second, for CVA,\nmarket-based views of default\nprobabilities derived from\nobserved credit spreads in the\ncredit default swap (CDS)\nmarket are applied to the\nexpected future cash flows\ndetermined in step one. Citi\u2019s\nown-credit CVA is determined\nusing Citi-specific CDS\nspreads for the relevant\ntenor. Generally, counterparty\nCVA is determined using CDS\nspread indices for each credit\nrating and tenor. For certain\nidentified netting sets where\nindividual analysis is\npracticable (e.g., exposures\nto counterparties with liquid\nCDSs), counterparty-specific\nCDS spreads are used. For FVA,\na term structure of future\nliquidity spreads is applied\nto the expected future funding\nrequirement.\n\nThe CVA and FVA are designed\nto incorporate a market view\nof the credit and funding\nrisk, respectively, inherent\nin the derivative portfolio.\nHowever, most unsecured\nderivative instruments are\nnegotiated bilateral contracts\nand are not commonly\ntransferred to third parties.\nDerivative instruments are\nnormally settled contractually\nor, if terminated early, are\nterminated at a value\nnegotiated bilaterally between\nthe counterparties. Thus, the\nCVA and FVA may not be\nrealized upon a settlement or\ntermination in the normal\ncourse of business. In\naddition, all or a portion of\nthese adjustments may be\nreversed or otherwise adjusted\nin future periods in the event\nof changes in the credit or\nfunding risk associated with\nthe derivative instruments.\nThe table below summarizes the CVA and FVA applied to the fair\nvalue of derivative instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n                                                                \n                                 Credit and                     \n                          funding valuation                     \n                                adjustments                     \n                           contra-liability                     \n                             (contra-asset)                     \n  In millions of               December 31,       December 31,  \n  dollars                              2020               2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Counterparty CVA     $               -800    $          -705  \n  Asset FVA                            -525               -530  \n  Citigroup                             403                341  \n  (own-credit) CVA                                              \n  Liability FVA                          67                 72  \n  Total                                                         \n  CVA\u2014derivative       $               -855    $          -822  \n  instruments(1)                                                \n                                                                \n(1) FVA is included with CVA for presentation purposes.\nThe table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to\nchanges in CVA on derivative instruments, net of hedges, FVA on\nderivatives and debt valuation adjustments (DVA) on Citi\u2019s own\nfair value option (FVO) liabilities for the years indicated:\n                                                                \n                       Credit/fundin\u2026                           \n                            valuation                           \n                          adjustments                           \n  In millions of          gain (loss)                           \n  dollars                        2020         2019        2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Counterparty      $            -101    $     149    $   -109  \n  CVA                                                           \n  Asset FVA                       -95           13          46  \n  Own-credit CVA                  133         -131         178  \n  Liability FVA                    -6          -63          56  \n  Total                                                         \n  CVA\u2014derivative    $             -69    $     -32    $    171  \n  instruments                                                   \n  DVA related to                                                \n  own FVO           $            -616    $  -1,473    $  1,415  \n  liabilities(1)                                                \n  Total CVA and     $            -685    $  -1,505    $  1,586  \n  DVA(2)                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Notes 1, 17 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n(2) FVA is included with CVA for presentation purposes.\nSecurities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell and\nSecurities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase No\nquoted prices exist for these\ninstruments, so fair value is\ndetermined using a discounted\ncash flow technique. Cash\nflows are estimated based on\nthe terms of the contract,\ntaking into account any\nembedded derivative or other\nfeatures. These cash flows are\ndiscounted using interest\nrates appropriate to the\nmaturity of the instrument as\nwell as the nature of the\n                              260                               \nunderlying collateral. Generally, when such instruments are\nrecorded at fair value, they are classified within Level 2 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, as the inputs used in the valuation\nare readily observable. However, certain long-dated positions\nare classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities\u2014Trading Securities and\nTrading Loans When available, the Company uses quoted market\nprices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading\nsecurities; such items are classified as Level 1 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Examples include government securities and\nexchange-traded equity securities. For bonds and secondary\nmarket loans traded over the counter, the Company generally\ndetermines fair value utilizing valuation techniques, including\ndiscounted cash flows, price-based and internal models. Fair\nvalue estimates from these internal valuation techniques are\nverified, where possible, to prices obtained from independent\nsources, including third-party vendors. Vendors compile prices\nfrom various sources and may apply matrix pricing for similar\nbonds or loans where no price is observable. A price-based\nmethodology utilizes, where available, quoted prices or other\nmarket information obtained from recent trading activity of\nassets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being\nvalued. The yields used in discounted cash flow models are\nderived from the same price information. Trading securities and\nloans priced using such methods are generally classified as\nLevel 2. However, when a quoted price is stale, a significant\nadjustment to the price of a similar security or loan is\nnecessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual\nsecurity or loan being valued, or prices from independent\nsources are insufficient to corroborate valuation, a loan or\nsecurity is generally classified as Level 3. The price input\nused in a price-based methodology may be zero for a security,\nsuch as a subprime collateralized debt obligation (CDO), that is\nnot receiving any principal or interest and is not expected to\nreceive any in the future. When the Company\u2019s principal exit\nmarket for a portfolio of loans is through securitization, the\nCompany uses the securitization price as a key input into the\nfair value of the loan portfolio. The securitization price is\ndetermined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical\nsecuritization within the current market environment, with\nadjustments made to account for various costs associated with\nthe process of securitization. Where such a price verification\nis possible, loan portfolios are typically classified as Level 2\nin the fair value hierarchy. For most of the subprime mortgage\nbacked security (MBS) exposures, fair value is determined\nutilizing observable transactions where available, or other\nvaluation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis\nutilizing valuation assumptions derived from similar, more\nobservable securities as market proxies. The valuation of\ncertain asset-backed security (ABS) CDO positions are inferred\nthrough the net asset value of the underlying assets of the ABS\nCDO. Trading Account Assets and Liabilities\u2014Derivatives\nExchange-traded derivatives, measured at fair value using quoted\n(i.e., exchange) prices in active markets, where available, are\nclassified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Derivatives\nwithout a quoted price in an active market and derivatives\nexecuted over the counter are valued using internal valuation\ntechniques. These derivative instruments are classified as\neither Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability of the\nsignificant inputs to the model. The valuation techniques depend\non the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying\ninstrument. The principal techniques used to value these\ninstruments are discounted cash flows and internal models, such\nas derivative pricing models (e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte\nCarlo simulations). The key inputs depend upon the type of\nderivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and\ninclude interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates,\nvolatilities and correlation. The Company typically uses OIS\ncurves as fair value measurement inputs for the valuation of\ncertain derivatives. Investments The investments category\nincludes available-for-sale debt and marketable equity\nsecurities whose fair values are generally determined by\nutilizing similar procedures described for trading securities\nabove or, in some cases, using vendor pricing as the primary\nsource. Also included in investments are nonpublic investments\nin private equity and real estate entities. Determining the fair\nvalue of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of\nmanagement judgment, as no quoted prices exist and such\nsecurities do not generally trade. In addition, there may be\ntransfer restrictions on private equity securities. The\nCompany\u2019s process for determining the fair value of such\nsecurities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques,\nincluding guideline public company analysis and comparable\ntransactions. In determining the fair value of nonpublic\nsecurities, the Company also considers events such as a proposed\nsale of the investee company, initial public offerings, equity\nissuances or other observable transactions. Private equity\nsecurities are generally classified as Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy. In addition, the Company holds investments in certain\nalternative investment funds that calculate NAV per share,\nincluding hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate\nfunds. Investments in funds are generally classified as non-\nmarketable equity securities carried at fair value. The fair\nvalues of these investments are estimated using the NAV per\nshare of the Company\u2019s ownership interest in the funds where it\nis not probable that the investment will be realized at a price\nother than the NAV. Consistent with the provisions of ASU\n2015-07, these investments have not been categorized within the\nfair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below.\nSee Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information.\n                              261                               \nShort-Term Borrowings and\nLong-Term Debt Where fair\nvalue accounting has been\nelected, the fair value of\nnon-structured liabilities is\ndetermined by utilizing\ninternal models using the\nappropriate discount rate for\nthe applicable maturity. Such\ninstruments are generally\nclassified as Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy when all\nsignificant inputs are readily\nobservable. The Company\ndetermines the fair value of\nhybrid financial instruments,\nincluding structured\nliabilities, using the\nappropriate derivative\nvaluation methodology\n(described above in \u201cTrading\nAccount Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Derivatives\u201d)\ngiven the nature of the\nembedded risk profile. Such\ninstruments are classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 depending\non the observability of\nsignificant inputs to the\nmodel.\n                              262                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The gains and losses\npresented below include changes in the fair value related to\nboth observable and unobservable inputs. The Company often\nhedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified\nin a different level.

In other instances, market changes resulted in\nunobservable volatility inputs becoming insignificant to the\noverall valuation of the instrument (e.g., when an option\nbecomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has resulted in\n$ 2.6billion of certain structured long-term debt products being\ntransferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the 12 months ended\nDecember 31, 2020. The following were the significant Level 3\ntransfers for the period December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019:\n\u2022 Transfers of Long-term debt of $ 3.3billion from Level 2 to\nLevel 3, and of $ 4.4billion from Level 3 to Level 2, mainly\nrelated to structured debt, reflecting changes in the\nsignificance of unobservable inputs as well as certain\nunderlying market inputs becoming less or more observable.\n                              270                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements The Company\u2019s Level 3 inventory consists of both\ncash instruments and derivatives of varying complexity. The\nvaluation methodologies used to measure the fair value of these\npositions include discounted cash flow analysis, internal models\nand comparative analysis. A position is classified within Level\n3 of the fair value hierarchy when one or more unobservable\ninputs are used that are considered significant to its\nvaluation. The specific reason an input is deemed unobservable\nvaries; for example, at least one significant input to the\npricing model is not observable in the market, at least one\nsignificant input has been adjusted to make it more\nrepresentative of the position being valued or the price quote\navailable does not reflect sufficient trading activities. The\nfollowing tables present the valuation techniques covering the\nmajority of Level 3 inventory and the most significant\nunobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements.\nDifferences between this table and amounts presented in the\nLevel 3 Fair Value Rollforward table represent individually\nimmaterial items that have been measured using a variety of\nvaluation techniques other

of the\nexit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today\u2019s\nmarket. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value\ninstruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that\nmay be both unobservable and significant to the instrument\u2019s (or\nportfolio\u2019s) overall fair value measurement. The uncertainties\nassociated with key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements may not be independent of one another. In\naddition, the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair\nvalue measurement for a given change in an unobservable input\ndepends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the\nCompany holds the instrument as an asset or a liability. For\ncertain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk management\nare sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather\nthan on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs.\nThe following section describes some of the most significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements. Correlation Correlation is a measure of the extent\nto which two or more variables change in relation to each other.\nA variety of\n                              273                               \ncorrelation-related assumptions are required for a wide range of\ninstruments, including equity and credit baskets, foreign\nexchange options, CDOs backed by loans or bonds, mortgages,\nsubprime mortgages and many other instruments. For almost all of\nthese instruments, correlations are not directly observable in\nthe market and must be calculated using alternative sources,\nincluding historical information. Estimating correlation can be\nespecially difficult where it may vary over time, and\ncalculating correlation information from market data requires\nsignificant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency\nof the market (e.g., swaption markets). Uncertainty therefore\nexists when an estimate of the appropriate level of correlation\nas an input into some fair value measurements is required.\nChanges in correlation levels can have a substantial impact,\nfavorable or unfavorable, on the value of an instrument,\ndepending on its nature. A change in the default correlation of\nthe fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a CDO\nstructure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche. For\nexample, an increase in the default correlation of the\nunderlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior\ntranche, because highly correlated instruments produce greater\nlosses in the event of default and a portion of these losses\nwould become attributable to the senior tranche. That same\nchange in default correlation would have a different impact on\njunior tranches of the same structure. Volatility Volatility\nrepresents the speed and severity of market price changes and is\na key factor in pricing options. Volatility generally depends on\nthe tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or\nlevel defined in the contract. Volatilities for certain\ncombinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to\nbe estimated using alternative methods, such as using comparable\ninstruments, historical analysis or other sources of market\ninformation. This leads to uncertainty around the final fair\nvalue measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities.\nThe general relationship between changes in the value of a\nportfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in\ninterest rates and the level of the underlying index. Generally,\nlong option positions (assets) benefit from increases in\nvolatility, whereas short option positions (liabilities) will\nsuffer losses. Some instruments are more sensitive to changes in\nvolatility than others. For example, an at-the-money option\nwould experience a greater percentage change in its fair value\nthan a deep-in-the-money option. In addition, the fair value of\nan option with more than one underlying security (e.g., an\noption on a basket of bonds) depends on the volatility of the\nindividual underlying securities as well as their correlations.\nYield In some circumstances, the yield of an instrument is not\nobservable in the market and must be estimated from historical\ndata or from yields of similar securities. This estimated yield\nmay need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the\nsecurity being valued. In other situations, the estimated yield\nmay not represent sufficient market liquidity and must be\nadjusted as well. Whenever the amount of the adjustment is\nsignificant to the value of the security, the fair value\nmeasurement is classified as Level 3. Adjusted yield is\ngenerally used to discount the projected future principal and\ninterest cash flows on instruments, such as asset-backed\nsecurities. Adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the\ninterest rate environment and relevant credit spreads.\nPrepayment Voluntary unscheduled payments (prepayments) change\nthe future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the\nfair value of the security. The effect of prepayments is more\npronounced for residential mortgage-backed securities. An\nincrease in prepayments\u2014in speed or magnitude\u2014generally creates\nlosses for the holder of these securities. Prepayment is\ngenerally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest\nrate. A combination of low prepayments and high delinquencies\namplifies each input\u2019s negative impact on a mortgage securities\u2019\nvaluation. As prepayment speeds change, the weighted average\nlife of the security changes, which impacts the valuation either\npositively or negatively, depending upon the nature of the\nsecurity and the direction of the change in the weighted average\nlife. Recovery Recovery is the proportion of the total\noutstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be\ncollected in a liquidation scenario. For many credit securities\n(such as asset-backed securities), there is no directly\nobservable market input for recovery, but indications of\nrecovery levels are available from pricing services. The assumed\nrecovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that\nwill be observable in the future. The recovery rate impacts the\nvaluation of credit securities. Generally, an increase in the\nrecovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the\nsecurity. An increase in loss severity, the inverse of the\nrecovery rate, reduces the amount of principal available for\ndistribution and, as a result, decreases the fair value of the\nsecurity. Credit Spread Credit spread is a component of the\nsecurity representing its credit quality. Credit spread reflects\nthe market perception of changes in prepayment, delinquency and\nrecovery rates, therefore capturing the impact of other\nvariables on the fair value. Changes in credit spread affect the\nfair value of securities differently depending on the\ncharacteristics and maturity profile of the security. For\nexample, credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair\nvalue measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an\ninvestment grade bond. Generally, the credit spread for an\ninvestment grade bond is also more observable and less volatile\nthan its high yield counterpart.\n                              274                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\nCertain assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and,\ntherefore, are not included in\nthe tables above.

If no such quoted\nprice exists, the fair value\nof a loan is determined using\nquoted prices for a similar\nasset or assets, adjusted for\nthe specific attributes of\nthat loan. Fair value for the\nother real estate owned is\nbased on appraisals. For loans\nwhose carrying amount is based\non the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral, the\nfair values depend on the type\nof collateral. Fair value of\nthe collateral is typically\nestimated based on quoted\nmarket prices if available,\nappraisals or other internal\nvaluation techniques.\n\nWhere the fair value of the\nrelated collateral is based on\nan unadjusted appraised value,\nthe loan is generally\nclassified as Level 2. Where\nsignificant adjustments are\nmade to the appraised value,\nthe loan is classified as\nLevel 3. In addition, for\ncorporate loans, appraisals of\nthe collateral are often based\non sales of similar assets;\nhowever, because the prices of\nsimilar assets require\nsignificant adjustments to\nreflect the unique features of\nthe underlying collateral,\nthese fair value measurements\nare generally classified as\nLevel 3. The fair value of\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities under the\nmeasurement alternative is\nbased on observed transaction\nprices for the identical or\nsimilar investment of the same\nissuer, or an internal\nvaluation technique in the\ncase of an impairment. Where\nsignificant adjustments are\nmade to the observed\ntransaction price or when an\ninternal valuation technique\nis used, the security is\nclassified as Level 3. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\n                              275                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Nonrecurring Fair\nValue

The tables below therefore exclude items\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the\ntables above. The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate\ninvestments, pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance\ncontracts and tax-related items. Also, as required, the\ndisclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount\nthat could result from offering for sale at one time the entire\nholdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value\nassociated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other\nexpenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In\naddition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets\nand liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise,\nrelationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full\nassessment of Citigroup\u2019s financial position and the value of\nits net assets. Fair values vary from period to period based on\nchanges in a wide range of factors, including interest rates,\ncredit quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing\nassets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered\ninto.\n                                                                \n            Dec\u2026                   Est\u2026                         \n

See Notes 19 and 24\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                              279                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation. Among other variables, the fair value of\nliabilities for which the fair value option has been elected\n(other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is\nimpacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss\nof $ 616million and a loss of $ 1,473million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in fair value\nresulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were\nestimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads\nobservable in the bond market into the relevant valuation\ntechnique used to value each liability as described above. The\nFair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nSelected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to\nResell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Non-Collateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made\nbecause the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio\nbasis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are\naccounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair\nvalue for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . The related interest revenue and\ninterest expense are measured based on the contractual rates\nspecified in the transactions and are reported as Interest\nrevenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Certain Loans and Other Credit Products Citigroup has\nalso elected the fair value option for certain other originated\nand purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products,\nsuch as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by\nCitigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit\nproducts are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant\ngroups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products\nthat are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near\nterm, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with\nderivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps\nor total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on\nthe underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases\nwhere hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending\ntransactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                Decemb\u2026                                         \n                    31,                   December              \n                   2020                   31, 2019              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026       Trading       Loans        Trading       Loans  \n  of             assets                     assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $    8,063    $  6,854    $     8,320    $  4,086  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess           -915         -14            410         315  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans               \u2014           4              \u2014           1  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value               \u2014           \u2014              \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 1,068million and $\n1,062million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n                              280                               \nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of\n$( 16) million and a gain of $ 95million, respectively. Certain\nInvestments in Unallocated Precious Metals Citigroup invests in\nunallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and\npalladium) as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading\nactivities or to economically hedge certain exposures from\nissuing structured liabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is\nbifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity forward\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the debt host contract\nwithin Trading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts\nacross unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $\n0.5billion and $ 0.2billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based on\ntrading activity in future periods. As part of its commodity and\nforeign currency trading activities, Citi trades unallocated\nprecious metals investments and executes forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties.\nWhen Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment,\nCiti\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, there were approximately $ 7.4billion and $\n6.3billion in notional amounts of such forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures\nCitigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for\nthe purpose of earning investment returns and for capital\nappreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for\ncertain of these ventures, because such investments are\nconsidered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)\nCitigroup has elected the fair value option for certain\npurchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming\nadjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are\nintended for sale or securitization and are hedged with\nderivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value\noption to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge\naccounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.\nThe following table provides information about certain mortgage\nloans HFS carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of          December 31,                          \n  dollars                         2020       December 31, 2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the      $         1,742    $              1,254  \n  Consolidated                                                  \n  Balance Sheet                                                 \n  Aggregate fair                                                \n  value in excess                                               \n  of (less                          91                     -31  \n  than) unpaid                                                  \n  principal balance                                             \n  Balance of                                                    \n  non-accrual loans                                             \n  or loans                           \u2014                       1  \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past due                                                      \n  Aggregate unpaid                                              \n  principal balance                                             \n  in                                                            \n  excess of fair                                                \n  value for                          \u2014                       \u2014  \n  non-accrual                                                   \n  loans or loans                                                \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are\nreported in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

For\n\ncertain contracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee.\n\nIn addition, the guarantor\nmust disclose the maximum\npotential amount of future\npayments that the guarantor\ncould be required to make\nunder the guarantee, if there\nwere a total\n\ndefault by the guaranteed\nparties. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future\npayments is based on the\nnotional amount of the\nguarantees without\nconsideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse\nprovisions or from collateral\nheld or pledged. As such, Citi\nbelieves such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the\nanticipated losses, if any, on\nthese guarantees.\n                              284                               \nThe following

lending indemnifications\nand credit card merchant processing were not material for either\nperiod presented, as the probability of potential liabilities\narising from these guarantees is minimal.\n(2) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, this maximum potential\nexposure was estimated to be $ 102billion and $ 92billion,\nrespectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure\nis not representative of the actual potential loss exposure\nbased on its historical experience. This contingent liability is\nunlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered\nwhen purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned\nto merchants.\nFinancial Standby Letters of Credit Citi issues standby letters\nof credit, which substitute its own credit for that of the\nborrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is\nobligated to repay Citi. Standby letters of credit protect a\nthird party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial\nstandby letters of credit include (i) guarantees of payment of\ninsurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial\nrevenue bond underwriting, (ii) settlement of payment\nobligations to clearing houses, including futures and over-the-\ncounter derivatives clearing (see further discussion below),\n(iii) support options and purchases of securities in lieu of\nescrow deposit accounts and (iv) letters of credit that backstop\nloans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade\nacceptances. Performance Guarantees Performance guarantees and\nletters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer\u2019s tender\nbid on a construction or systems-installation project or to\nguarantee completion of such projects in accordance with\ncontract terms. They are also issued to support a customer\u2019s\nobligation to supply specified products, commodities or\nmaintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative\nInstruments Considered to Be Guarantees Derivatives are\nfinancial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional\namount and an underlying instrument, reference credit or index,\nwhere there is little or no initial investment, and whose terms\nrequire or permit net settlement. For a discussion of Citi\u2019s\nderivatives activities, see Note 22 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. Derivative instruments considered to be\nguarantees include only those instruments that require Citi to\nmake payments to the counterparty based on changes in an\nunderlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability\nor an equity security held by the guaranteed party. More\nspecifically, derivative instruments considered to be guarantees\ninclude certain over-the-counter written put options\n                              285                               \nwhere the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-\ndealer (such counterparties are considered to be dealers in\nthese markets and may, therefore, not hold the underlying\ninstruments). Credit derivatives sold by Citi are excluded from\nthe tables above as they are disclosed separately in Note 22 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements. In instances where Citi\u2019s\nmaximum potential future payment is unlimited, the notional\namount of the contract is disclosed. Loans Sold with Recourse\nLoans sold with recourse represent Citi\u2019s obligations to\nreimburse the buyers for loan losses under certain\ncircumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the seller\u2019s taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 31million and $ 37million at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and these amounts are\nincluded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSecurities Lending Indemnifications Owners of securities\nfrequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who\nmay sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy\nsome other obligation. Banks may administer such securities\nlending programs for their clients. Securities lending\nindemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a\nsecurities lending customer will be made whole in the event that\nthe security borrower does not return the security subject to\nthe lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to\ncover the market value of the security. Credit Card Merchant\nProcessing Credit card merchant processing guarantees represent\nthe Company\u2019s indirect obligations in connection with (i)\nproviding transaction processing services to various merchants\nwith respect to its private label cards and (ii) potential\nliability for bank card transaction processing services. The\nnature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a\nbilling dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is\nultimately resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor. The merchant is\nliable to refund the amount to the cardholder. In general, if\nthe credit card processing company is unable to collect this\namount from the merchant, the credit card processing company\nbears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to\nthe cardholder. With regard to (i) above, Citi has the primary\ncontingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private\nlabel merchants. The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows\nbetween Citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis, and\nCiti has the right to offset any payments with cash flows\notherwise due to the merchant. To further mitigate this risk,\nCiti may delay settlement, require a merchant to make an escrow\ndeposit, include event triggers to provide Citi with more\nfinancial and operational control in the event of the financial\ndeterioration of the merchant or require various credit\nenhancements (including letters of credit and bank guarantees).\nIn the unlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to\ndeliver products, services or a refund to its private label\ncardholders, Citi is contingently liable to credit or refund\ncardholders. With regard to (ii) above, Citi has a potential\nliability for bank card transactions where Citi provides the\ntransaction processing services as well as those where a third\nparty provides the services and Citi acts as a secondary\nguarantor, should that processor fail to perform. Citi\u2019s maximum\npotential contingent liability related to both bank card and\nprivate label merchant processing services is estimated to be\nthe total volume of credit card transactions that meet the\nrequirements to be valid charge-back transactions at any given\ntime. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, this maximum potential\nexposure was estimated to be $ 101.9billion and $ 91.6billion,\nrespectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure\nis not representative of the actual potential loss exposure\nbased on its historical experience. This contingent liability is\nunlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered\nwhen purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned\nto merchants. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its\ncontingent liability related to merchant processing based on the\nfinancial strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and\nnature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss\nexperience. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the losses incurred\nand the carrying amounts of Citi\u2019s contingent obligations\nrelated to merchant processing activities were immaterial.\nCredit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of its\ncredit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations.\nCustody Indemnifications Custody indemnifications are issued to\nguarantee that custody clients will be made whole in the event\nthat a third-party subcustodian or depository institution fails\nto safeguard clients\u2019 assets.\n                              286                               \nOther Guarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection\nPrograms Citi, through its credit card businesses, provides\nvarious cardholder protection programs on several of its card\nproducts, including programs that provide insurance coverage for\nrental cars, coverage for certain losses associated with\npurchased products, price protection for certain purchases and\nprotection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included\nin the table, since the total outstanding amount of the\nguarantees and Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be\nquantified. The protection is limited to certain types of\npurchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the\npurchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given\ntime. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential\nliability related to these programs based on the extent and\nnature of its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2020\nand 2019, the actual and estimated losses incurred and the\ncarrying value of Citi\u2019s obligations related to these programs\nwere immaterial. Other Representation and Warranty\nIndemnifications In the normal course of business, Citi provides\nstandard representations and warranties to counterparties in\ncontracts in connection with numerous transactions and also\nprovides indemnifications, including indemnifications that\nprotect the counterparties to the contracts in the event that\nadditional taxes are owed, due either to a change in the tax law\nor an adverse interpretation of the tax law. Counterparties to\nthese transactions provide Citi with comparable\nindemnifications. While such representations, warranties and\nindemnifications are essential components of many contractual\nrelationships, they do not represent the underlying business\npurpose for the transactions. The indemnification clauses are\noften standard contractual terms related to Citi\u2019s own\nperformance under the terms of a contract and are entered into\nin the normal course of business based on an assessment that the\nrisk of loss is remote. Often these clauses are intended to\nensure that terms of a contract are met at inception.\nNocompensation is received for these standard representations\nand warranties, and it is not possible to determine their fair\nvalue because they rarely, if ever, result in a payment. In many\ncases, there are nostated or notional amounts included in the\nindemnification clauses, and the contingencies potentially\ntriggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are\nnot expected to occur. As a result, these indemnifications are\nnot included in the tables above. Value-Transfer Networks\n(Including Exchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs) Citi is a\nmember of, or shareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer\nnetworks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and settlement systems as\nwell as exchanges) around the world. As a condition of\nmembership, many of these VTNs require that members stand ready\nto pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the\norganization due to another member\u2019s default on its obligations.\nCiti\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its membership\ninterests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s funds, or, in\ncertain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share. The maximum\nexposure is difficult to estimate as this would require an\nassessment of claims that have not yet occurred; however, Citi\nbelieves the risk of loss is remote given historical experience\nwith the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s participation in VTNs is not\nreported in the guarantees tables above, and there are no\namounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2020 or 2019 for potential obligations that could\narise from Citi\u2019s involvement with VTN associations. Long-Term\nCare Insurance Indemnification In 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity\n(Travelers), then a subsidiary of Citi, entered into a\nreinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and rewards of its\nlong-term care (LTC) business to GE Life (now Genworth Financial\nInc., or Genworth), then a subsidiary of the General Electric\nCompany (GE). As part of this transaction, the reinsurance\nobligations were provided by two regulated insurance\nsubsidiaries of GE Life, which funded twocollateral trusts with\nsecurities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are\nreferred to as the Genworth Trusts. As part of GE\u2019s spin-off of\nGenworth in 2004, GE retained the risks and rewards associated\nwith the 2000 Travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a\nreinsurance contract to Genworth through GE\u2019s Union Fidelity\nLife Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the\nTravelers LTC policies. In addition, GE provided a capital\nmaintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC that is designed to\nassure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay its reinsurance\nobligations. As a result of these reinsurance agreements and the\nspin-off of Genworth, Genworth has reinsurance protection from\nUFLIC (supported by GE) and has reinsurance obligations in\nconnection with the Travelers LTC policies. As noted below, the\nGenworth reinsurance obligations now benefit Brighthouse\nFinancial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While neither Brighthouse nor\nCiti are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance\nagreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit\nindirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance\nagreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will continue to have\nfunds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to Genworth.\nIn connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of Travelers to MetLife Inc.\n(MetLife), Citi provided an indemnification to MetLife for\nlosses (including policyholder claims) relating to the LTC\nbusiness for the entire term of the Travelers LTC policies,\nwhich, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries of\nGenworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance\nbusiness to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers LTC policies\nnow reside with Brighthouse. The original reinsurance agreement\nbetween Travelers (now Brighthouse) and Genworth remains in\nplace and Brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the Genworth\nTrusts. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide collateral\nto Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities\nof Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC policies. The\nassets in the Genworth Trusts are evaluated and adjusted\nperiodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets\ncontinues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these\nestimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change over\ntime. If both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original\nTravelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason,\n                              287                               \nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the two\nGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019 related to this indemnification. However, if both\nevents become reasonably possible (meaning more than remote but\nless than probable), Citi will be required to estimate and\ndisclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the\nextent that such an estimate could be made. In addition, if both\nevents become probable, Citi will be required to accrue for such\nliability in accordance with applicable accounting principles.\nCiti continues to closely monitor its potential exposure under\nthis indemnification obligation, given GE\u2019s 2018 LTC and other\ncharges and the September 2019 AM Best credit ratings downgrade\nfor the Genworth subsidiaries. Separately, Genworth announced\nthat it had agreed to be purchased by China Oceanwide Holdings\nCo., Ltd, subject to a series of conditions and regulatory\napprovals. Citi is monitoring these developments. Futures and\nOver-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing\nservices on central clearing parties (CCPs) for clients that\nneed to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and\ncircumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for\naccounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these\nclient transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the\nunderlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. See Note 22 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities that are reflected in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. As a clearing member, Citi\ncollects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin)\nbetween its clients and the respective CCP. In certain\ncircumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or\nsecurities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs.\nThis excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as\nbanks or carry brokers. There are twotypes of margin: initial\nand variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash\ninitial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial\nmargin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or\ndepository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables\n(payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and\ndue from banks , respectively. However, for exchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain\nbenefits from or control the client cash balances, the client\ncash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the\nCCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi\nhas contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 16.6billion and $ 13.3billion as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively. Variation margin due from clients\nto the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts for\neach trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the\nrisk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to\npost variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the\nvalue of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of\nnon-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event\nthat the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n                              288                               \nCarrying Value\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 2.2billion and $\n1.2billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities. For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 51.6billion and $\n46.7billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSecurities and other marketable assets held as collateral\namounted to $ 80.1billion and $ 58.6billion at December 31, 2020\nand 2019, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to\nreimburse losses realized under securities lending\nindemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of\nCiti held as collateral amounted to $ 6.6billion and $\n4.4billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other\nproperty may also be available to Citi to cover losses under\ncertain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of\nsuch property has not been determined. Performance Risk Citi\nevaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the\nassigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be Baa/BBB and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. On certain\nunderlying referenced assets or entities, ratings are not\navailable. Such referenced assets are included in the \u201cnot\nrated\u201d category. The maximum potential amount of the future\npayments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to\nbe the notional amount of these contracts, which is the par\namount of the assets guaranteed. Presented in the tables below\nare the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are\nclassified based on internal and external credit ratings. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts\nbear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

unused\ncommitments are contingent\nupon customers\u2019 maintaining\nspecific credit standards.\nCommercial commitments\ngenerally have floating\ninterest rates and fixed\nexpiration dates and may\nrequire payment of fees. Such\nfees (net of certain direct\ncosts) are deferred and, upon\nexercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the\nloan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the\ncommitment period. Commercial\nand Similar Letters of Credit\nA commercial letter of credit\nis an instrument by which\nCitigroup substitutes its\ncredit for that of a customer\nto enable the customer to\nfinance the purchase of goods\nor to incur other commitments.\nCitigroup issues a letter on\nbehalf of its client to a\nsupplier and agrees to pay the\nsupplier upon presentation of\ndocumentary evidence that the\nsupplier has performed in\naccordance with the terms of\nthe letter of credit. When a\nletter of credit is drawn, the\ncustomer is then required to\nreimburse Citigroup. One- to\nFour-Family Residential\nMortgages A one- to four-\nfamily residential mortgage\ncommitment is a written\nconfirmation from Citigroup to\na seller of a property that\nthe bank will advance the\nspecified sums enabling the\nbuyer to complete the\npurchase. Revolving Open-End\nLoans Secured by One- to Four-\nFamily Residential Properties\nRevolving open-end loans\nsecured by one- to four-family\nresidential properties are\nessentially home equity lines\nof credit. A home equity line\nof credit is a loan secured by\na primary residence or second\nhome to the extent of the\nexcess of fair market value\nover the debt outstanding for\nthe first mortgage. Commercial\nReal Estate, Construction and\nLand Development Commercial\nreal estate, construction and\nland development include\nunused portions of commitments\nto extend credit for the\npurpose of financing\ncommercial and multifamily\nresidential properties as well\nas land development projects.\n\nBoth secured-by-real-estate\nand unsecured commitments are\nincluded in this line, as well\nas undistributed loan\nproceeds, where there is an\nobligation to advance for\nconstruction progress\npayments. However, this line\nonly includes those extensions\nof credit that, once funded,\nwill be classified as Total\nloans, net on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Credit Card\nLines Citigroup provides\ncredit to customers by issuing\ncredit cards. The credit card\nlines are cancelable by\nproviding notice to the\ncardholder or without such\nnotice as permitted by local\nlaw. Commercial and Other\nConsumer Loan Commitments\nCommercial and other consumer\nloan commitments include\noverdraft and liquidity\nfacilities as well as\ncommercial commitments to make\nor purchase loans, purchase\nthird-party receivables,\nprovide note issuance or\nrevolving underwriting\nfacilities and invest in the\nform of equity. Other\nCommitments and Contingencies\nOther commitments and\ncontingencies include all\nother transactions related to\ncommitments and contingencies\nnot reported on the lines\nabove. Unsettled Reverse\nRepurchase and Securities\nBorrowing Agreements and\nUnsettled Repurchase and\nSecurities Lending Agreements\nIn addition, in the normal\ncourse of business, Citigroup\nenters into reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019,\nCitigroup had approximately $\n71.8billion and $ 34.0billion\nin unsettled reverse\nrepurchase and securities\nborrowing agreements, and $\n62.5billion and $ 38.7billion\nin unsettled repurchase and\nsecurities lending agreements,\nrespectively. For a further\ndiscussion of securities\npurchased under agreements to\nresell and securities\nborrowed, and securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase\nand securities loaned,\nincluding the Company\u2019s policy\nfor offsetting repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsee Note 11 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n                              290                               \n                                                                \n  27. CONTINGENCIES                                             \n                                                                \nAccounting and Disclosure\nFramework ASC 450 governs the\ndisclosure and recognition of\nloss contingencies, including\npotential losses from\nlitigation, regulatory, tax\nand other matters. ASC 450\ndefines a \u201closs contingency\u201d\nas \u201can existing condition,\nsituation, or set of\ncircumstances involving\nuncertainty as to possible\nloss to an entity that will\nultimately be resolved when\none or more future events\noccur or fail to occur.\u201d It\nimposes different requirements\nfor the recognition and\ndisclosure of loss\ncontingencies based on the\nlikelihood of occurrence of\nthe contingent future event or\nevents. It distinguishes among\ndegrees of likelihood using\nthe following three terms:\n\u201cprobable,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe\nfuture event or events are\nlikely to occur\u201d; \u201cremote,\u201d\nmeaning that \u201cthe chance of\nthe future event or events\noccurring is slight\u201d; and\n\u201creasonably possible,\u201d meaning\nthat \u201cthe chance of the future\nevent or events occurring is\nmore than remote but less than\nlikely.\u201d These three terms are\nused below as defined in ASC\n450. Accruals . ASC 450\nrequires accrual for a loss\ncontingency when it is\n\u201cprobable that one or more\nfuture events will occur\nconfirming the fact of loss\u201d\nand \u201cthe amount of the loss\ncan be reasonably estimated.\u201d\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nthe litigation, regulatory and\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. When the reasonable\nestimate of the loss is within\na range of amounts, the\nminimum amount of the range is\naccrued, unless some higher\namount within the range is a\nbetter estimate than any other\namount within the range. Once\nestablished, accruals are\nadjusted from time to time, as\nappropriate, in light of\nadditional information. The\namount of loss ultimately\nincurred in relation to those\nmatters may be substantially\nhigher or lower than the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters. Disclosure . ASC 450\nrequires disclosure of a loss\ncontingency if \u201cthere is at\nleast a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss or an additional\nloss may have been incurred\u201d\nand there is no accrual for\nthe loss because the\nconditions described above are\nnot met or an exposure to loss\nexists in excess of the amount\naccrued. In accordance with\nASC 450, if Citigroup has not\naccrued for a matter because\nCitigroup believes that a loss\nis reasonably possible but not\nprobable, or that a loss is\nprobable but not reasonably\nestimable, and the reasonably\npossible loss is material, it\ndiscloses the loss\ncontingency. In addition,\nCitigroup discloses matters\nfor which it has accrued if it\nbelieves a reasonably possible\nexposure to material loss\nexists in excess of the amount\naccrued. In accordance with\nASC 450, Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure includes an\nestimate of the reasonably\npossible loss or range of loss\nfor those matters as to which\nan estimate can be made. ASC\n450 does not require\ndisclosure of an estimate of\nthe reasonably possible loss\nor range of loss where an\nestimate cannot be made.\nNeither accrual nor disclosure\nis required for losses that\nare deemed remote.\n\nLitigation, Regulatory and\nOther Contingencies Overview.\nIn addition to the matters\ndescribed below, in the\nordinary course of business,\nCitigroup, its affiliates and\nsubsidiaries, and current and\nformer officers, directors and\nemployees (for purposes of\nthis section, sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties)\nroutinely are named as\ndefendants in, or as parties\nto, various legal actions and\nproceedings. Certain of these\nactions and proceedings assert\nclaims or seek relief in\nconnection with alleged\nviolations of consumer\nprotection, fair lending,\nsecurities, banking,\nantifraud, antitrust, anti-\nmoney laundering, employment\nand other statutory and common\nlaws. Certain of these actual\nor threatened legal actions\nand proceedings include claims\nfor substantial or\nindeterminate compensatory or\npunitive damages, or for\ninjunctive relief, and in some\ninstances seek recovery on a\nclass-wide basis. In the\nordinary course of business,\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nalso are subject to\ngovernmental and regulatory\nexaminations, information-\ngathering requests,\ninvestigations and proceedings\n(both formal and informal),\ncertain of which may result in\nadverse judgments,\nsettlements, fines, penalties,\nrestitution, disgorgement,\ninjunctions or other relief.\nIn addition, certain\naffiliates and subsidiaries of\nCitigroup are banks,\nregistered broker-dealers,\nfutures commission merchants,\ninvestment advisors or other\nregulated entities and, in\nthose capacities, are subject\nto regulation by various U.S.,\nstate and foreign securities,\nbanking, commodity futures,\nconsumer protection and other\nregulators. In connection with\nformal and informal inquiries\nby these regulators, Citigroup\nand such affiliates and\nsubsidiaries receive numerous\nrequests, subpoenas and orders\nseeking documents, testimony\nand other information in\nconnection with various\naspects of their regulated\nactivities. From time to time\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nalso receive grand jury\nsubpoenas and other requests\nfor information or assistance,\nformal or informal, from\nfederal or state law\nenforcement agencies\nincluding, among others,\nvarious United States\nAttorneys\u2019 Offices, the Asset\nForfeiture and Money\nLaundering Section and other\ndivisions of the Department of\nJustice, the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network of the\nUnited States Department of\nthe Treasury, and the Federal\nBureau of Investigation\nrelating to Citigroup and its\ncustomers. Because of the\nglobal scope of Citigroup\u2019s\noperations, and its presence\nin countries around the world,\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nare subject to litigation and\ngovernmental and regulatory\nexaminations, information-\ngathering requests,\ninvestigations and proceedings\n(both formal and informal) in\nmultiple jurisdictions with\nlegal, regulatory and tax\nregimes that may differ\nsubstantially, and present\nsubstantially different risks,\nfrom those Citigroup and\nRelated Parties are subject to\nin the United States. In some\ninstances, Citigroup and\nRelated Parties may be\ninvolved in proceedings\ninvolving the same subject\nmatter in multiple\njurisdictions, which may\nresult in overlapping,\ncumulative or inconsistent\noutcomes. Citigroup seeks to\nresolve all litigation,\nregulatory, tax and other\nmatters in the manner\nmanagement believes is in the\nbest interests of Citigroup\nand its shareholders, and\ncontests liability,\nallegations of wrongdoing and,\nwhere applicable, the amount\nof damages or scope of any\npenalties or other relief\nsought as appropriate in each\npending matter.\n                              291                               \nInherent Uncertainty of the Matters Disclosed. Certain of the\nmatters disclosed below involve claims for substantial or\nindeterminate damages. The claims asserted in these matters\ntypically are broad, often spanning a multiyear period and\nsometimes a wide range of business activities, and the\nplaintiffs\u2019 or claimants\u2019 alleged damages frequently are not\nquantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement\nof claim. Other matters relate to regulatory investigations or\nproceedings, as to which there may be no objective basis for\nquantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or other\nremedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the\nloss in such matters, even if it believes that a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case,\nproceeding or investigation have yielded additional information\nsufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of\nreasonably possible loss. Such developments may include, among\nother things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties,\nrulings by the court on key issues, analysis by retained experts\nand engagement in settlement negotiations. Depending on a range\nof factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the novelty of\nthe legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court\u2019s\nscheduling order, the timing of court decisions and the adverse\nparty\u2019s, regulator\u2019s or other authority\u2019s willingness to\nnegotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it may be months or\nyears after the filing of a case or commencement of a proceeding\nor an investigation before an estimate of the range of\nreasonably possible loss can be made. Matters as to Which an\nEstimate Can Be Made . For some of the matters disclosed below,\nCitigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For\nsome of the matters included within this estimation, an accrual\nhas been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and\nreasonably estimable, but an exposure to loss exists in excess\nof the amount accrued. In these cases, the estimate reflects the\nreasonably possible range of loss in excess of the accrued\namount. For other matters included within this estimation, no\naccrual has been made because a loss, although estimable, is\nbelieved to be reasonably possible, but not probable; in these\ncases, the estimate reflects the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss. As of December 31, 2020, Citigroup estimates that\nthe reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges\nup to approximately $ 1.4billion in the aggregate. These\nestimates are based on currently available information. As\navailable information changes, the matters for which Citigroup\nis able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition, while many estimates presented in\nfinancial statements and other financial disclosures involve\nsignificant judgment and may be subject to significant\nuncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss\narising from litigation, regulatory and tax proceedings are\nsubject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of\nmaking an estimate, (i) Citigroup may have only preliminary,\nincomplete, or inaccurate information about the facts underlying\nthe claim, (ii) its assumptions about the future rulings of the\ncourt, other tribunal or authority on significant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators or other\nauthorities, may prove to be wrong and (iii) the outcomes it is\nattempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of\nstatistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition,\nfrom time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not\naccounted for in its estimate because it had deemed such an\noutcome to be remote. For all of these reasons, the amount of\nloss in excess of accruals ultimately incurred for the matters\nas to which an estimate has been made could be substantially\nhigher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.\nMatters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made . For other\nmatters disclosed below, Citigroup is not currently able to\nestimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. Many of\nthese matters remain in very preliminary stages (even in some\ncases where a substantial period of time has passed since the\ncommencement of the matter), with few or no substantive legal\ndecisions by the court, tribunal or other authority defining the\nscope of the claims, the class (if any) or the potentially\navailable damages or other exposure, and fact discovery is still\nin progress or has not yet begun. In many of these matters,\nCitigroup has not yet answered the complaint or statement of\nclaim or asserted its defenses, nor has it engaged in any\nnegotiations with the adverse party (whether a regulator, taxing\nauthority or a private party). For all these reasons, Citigroup\ncannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss, if any, for these matters. Opinion of Management\nas to Eventual Outcome. Subject to the foregoing, it is the\nopinion of Citigroup\u2019s management, based on current knowledge\nand after taking into account its current legal or other\naccruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters described in\nthis Note would not likely have a material adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless,\ngiven the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain\nof these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could,\nfrom time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular\nquarterly or annual periods. ANZ Underwriting Matter In 2018,\nthe Australian Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions\n(CDPP) filed charges against Citigroup Global Markets Australia\nPty Limited (CGMA) for alleged criminal cartel offenses\nfollowing a referral by the Australian Competition and Consumer\nCommission. CDPP alleges that the cartel conduct took place\nfollowing an institutional share placement by Australia and New\nZealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) in August 2015, where CGMA\nacted as joint underwriter and lead manager with other banks.\nCDPP also charged other banks and individuals, including current\nand former Citi employees. Separately, the Australian Securities\nand Investments Commission is conducting an investigation, and\nCGMA is cooperating with the investigation. Charges relating to\nCGMA are captioned R v.

The\ndownward adjustment lowered Citigroup\u2019s fourth quarter net\nincome from $ 4.6billion to $ 4.3billion and earnings per\ndiluted share from $ 2.08to $ 1.92.\n(2) In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the second\nquarter accounting conclusion for its variable post-charge-off\nthird-party collection costs from a \u201cchange in accounting\nestimate effected by a change in accounting principle\u201d to a\n\u201cchange in accounting principle,\u201d which requires an adjustment\nto January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than net\nincome. As a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and quarterly results for\n2020 have been revised to reflect this change as if it were\neffective as of January 1, 2020. Citi recorded an increase to\nits beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $\n330million and a decrease of $ 443million in its allowance for\ncredit losses on loans, as well as a $ 113million increase in\nother assets related to income taxes, and recorded a decrease of\n$ 18million to its provisions for credit losses on loans in the\nfirst quarter and increases of $ 339million and $ 122million to\nits provisions for credit losses on loans in the second and\nthird quarters, respectively. In addition, Citi\u2019s operating\nexpenses increased by $ 49million and $ 45million with a\ncorresponding decrease in net credit losses, in the first and\nsecond quarters, respectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional information.\n(3) The fourth quarter of 2019 includes discrete tax items of\nroughly $ 540million including an approximate $ 430million\nbenefit of a reduction in Citi\u2019s valuation allowance related to\nits DTAs. The third quarter of 2019 includes discrete tax items\nof roughly $ 230million, including an approximate $ 180million\nbenefit of a reduction in Citi\u2019s valuation allowance related to\nits DTAs.\n(4) Certain securities were excluded from the second quarter of\n2020 diluted EPS calculation because they were anti-dilutive.\nYear-to-date EPS will not equal the sum of the individual\nquarters because the year-to-date EPS calculation is a separate\ncalculation. In addition, due to averaging of shares, quarterly\nearnings per share may not sum to the totals reported for the\nfull year.\n     End of Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to      \n               Consolidated Financial Statements                \n                                                                \n                              310                               \nFINANCIAL DATA SUPPLEMENT\nRATIOS\n                                                                \n                                 2020       2019       2018     \n  Return on average assets       0.50  %    0.98  %    0.94  %  \n  Return on average common                                      \n  stockholders\u2019                   5.7       10.3        9.4     \n  equity(1)                                                     \n  Return on average total                                       \n  stockholders\u2019                   5.7        9.9        9.1     \n  equity(2)                                                     \n  Total average equity to                                       \n  average                         8.7        9.9       10.3     \n  assets(3)                                                     \n  Dividend payout ratio(4)         43         24         23     \n                                                                \n(1) Based on Citigroup\u2019s net\nincome less preferred stock\ndividends as a percentage of\naverage common stockholders\u2019\nequity.

In\naddition, based on measures\nannounced by the Federal\nReserve Board throughout 2020,\nshare repurchases were\nprohibited through the end of\nthe fourth quarter of 2020.\nAccordingly, Citi did not have\nany share repurchases in the\nfourth quarter of 2020, other\nthan permitted repurchases\nrelating to issuances of\ncommon stock related to\nemployee stock ownership\nplans. During the fourth\nquarter, pursuant to\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors\u2019 authorization, Citi\nrepurchased 50,588 shares (at\nan average price of $54.59) of\ncommon stock, added to\ntreasury stock, related to\nactivity on employee stock\nprograms where shares were\nwithheld to satisfy the\nemployee tax requirements.\n\nBased on measures announced by\nthe Federal Reserve Board in\nDecember 2020, share\nrepurchases will be permitted\nduring the first quarter of\n2021, subject to limitations\nbased on net income for the\nfour preceding calendar\nquarters, in addition to the\npreviously announced common\ndividends paid during the\nfirst quarter of 2021. These\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions may be extended\nby the Federal Reserve Board.\nUnder these modified\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions, Citi is\nauthorized to return capital\nto common shareholders of up\nto $2.8 billion, during the\nfirst quarter of 2021,\nincluding the previously\nannounced common dividends of\n$0.51 per share in the\nquarter. Citi commenced share\nrepurchases in February 2021.\nFor additional information on\nthese capital distribution\nlimitations, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Capital Plan\nResubmission and Related\nLimitations on Capital\nDistributions\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Dividends                                                     \n                                                                \nConsistent with the regulatory\ncapital framework, Citi paid\ncommon dividends of $0.51 per\nshare for the fourth quarter\nof 2020 and the first quarter\nof 2021, and intends to\nmaintain its planned capital\nactions, which include common\ndividends of $0.51 per share\nthrough the second and third\nquarter of 2021 (the remaining\nquarters of the 2020 CCAR\ncycle), subject to approval of\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors and\nthe latest financial and\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n\nIn addition to Board of\nDirectors\u2019 approval, Citi\u2019s\nability to pay common stock\ndividends substantially\ndepends on the results of the\nCCAR process required by the\nFederal Reserve Board and the\nsupervisory stress tests\nrequired under the Dodd-Frank\nAct.
