The\nincrease was partially offset\nby productivity savings and\nexpense reductions from the\nexited markets and continued\nwind-downs (see \u201cExpenses\u201d\nbelow).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s cost of credit was\n$1.8 billion versus $1.4\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The increase was\nprimarily driven by the\nongoing normalization in net\ncredit losses and volume\ngrowth in Branded cards and\nRetail services in PBWM .\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $1.5 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends and share\nrepurchases.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) Capital ratio under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach increased to 13.6% as\nof September 30, 2023,\ncompared to 12.3% as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 (see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below).\nThis compares to Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio of 12.3% as of\nOctober 1, 2023 under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to make\nprogress on its consumer\nbanking business divestitures\nin the third quarter of 2023,\nincluding the closing of its\nTaiwan sale transaction and\nworking toward the closing of\nits Indonesia sale transaction\nin the fourth quarter of 2023.\n(For additional information on\nthe progress of Citi\u2019s other\nexits and wind-downs, see \u201c\nLegacy Franchises \u201d below.)\n\n\u2022 As previously disclosed,\nCiti announced it will be\nmaking changes to its\noperating model to simplify\nthe Company and further align\nits organizational structure\nwith its business strategy.\nThis new operating model will\nelevate the leaders of Citi\u2019s\nfive key businesses and\neliminate management layers,\nand reflect the next step in\nCiti\u2019s work to implement its\nstrategic and other\ninitiatives.

The net\nincome increase was driven by\nthe higher revenues, partially\noffset by the higher expenses,\nthe higher cost of credit and\na higher effective tax rate.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nwas 25% versus 20% in the\nprior-year period, largely\ndriven by the geographic mix\nof earnings in the current\nquarter (see \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d\nbelow).\n\nResults for the third quarter\nof 2023 included divestiture-\nrelated impacts of $299\nmillion in earnings before\ntaxes ($214 million after-\ntax). See \u201c Legacy Franchises\n\u201d below for details about the\ndivestiture-related impacts.\nThese divestiture-related\nimpacts, collectively, had a\n$0.11 beneficial impact on\nearnings per share (EPS) in\nthe current quarter. Excluding\nthese divestiture-related\nimpacts, EPS was $1.52. (As\nused throughout this Form\n10-Q, Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts\nare non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.)\n\nResults for the third quarter\nof 2022 included divestiture-\nrelated impacts of $519\nmillion in earnings before\ntaxes ($256 million after-\ntax). See \u201c Legacy Franchises\n\u201d below for details about the\ndivestiture-related impacts.\nThese divestiture-related\nimpacts, collectively, had a\n$0.13 beneficial impact on EPS\nin the prior-year period.\nExcluding these divestiture-\nrelated impacts, EPS was\n$1.50.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $20.1\nbillion in the third quarter\nof 2023 increased 9% on a\nreported basis, and 10%\nexcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts versus the prior-year\nperiod. The increase in\nrevenues reflected strength\nacross Services and Markets in\nInstitutional Clients Group\n(ICG) and U.S. Personal\nBanking in Personal Banking\nand Wealth Management (PBWM) ,\nas well as growth in Banking\nin ICG. The increase was\npartially offset by a revenue\nreduction from the exited\nmarkets and continued wind-\ndowns in Legacy Franchises .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $666 billion, up 3%\nversus the prior-year period,\nlargely driven by growth in\nU.S. Personal Banking.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were approximately\n$1.3 trillion, down 3% versus\nthe prior-year period. The\ndecline in deposits was\nlargely due to a reduction in\nServices, reflecting monetary\ntightening, a shift of\ndeposits to higher-yielding\ninvestments in Global Wealth\nManagement (Global Wealth) and\na reduction of institutional\ncertificates of deposit in\nCorporate/Other .

The higher expenses\nlargely reflected continued\ninvestments in risk and\ncontrols, the impact of\ninflation and severance,\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings and\nexpense reductions from the\nexited markets and wind-downs\nin Legacy Franchises. Expenses\nalso continued to be impacted\nby investments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation and business-\nand enterprise-led\ninvestments.\n\nCiti expects to continue to\nincur higher expenses in the\nfourth quarter of 2023,\nincluding additional severance\ncosts related to its\norganizational and management\nsimplification initiatives.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $1.8\nbillion, compared to $1.4\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. This increase was\ndriven by higher net credit\nlosses (see below), partially\noffset by a lower net build in\nthe ACL for loans and unfunded\ncommitments and other\nprovisions.\n\nThe net build of $203 million\nin the ACL for loans and\nunfunded lending commitments\nand other provisions in the\ncurrent quarter was primarily\ndriven by growth in Branded\ncards and Retail services card\nbalances in PBWM . This\ncompared to a net build of\n$478 million in the ACL for\nloans and unfunded lending\ncommitments and other\nprovisions in the prior-year\nperiod.

Consumer\nnet credit losses of $1.6\nbillion increased 79%,\nreflecting ongoing\nnormalization, particularly in\nBranded cards and Retail\nservices. Corporate net credit\nlosses increased to $58\nmillion from $6 million in the\nprior-year period.\n\nCiti expects to incur higher\nyear-over-year net credit\nlosses for the fourth quarter\nof 2023, primarily driven by\nongoing normalization,\nparticularly in the cards\nbusinesses in PBWM. Net credit\nlosses in the cards businesses\nare expected to reach pre-\npandemic levels by the end of\n2023 .\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 13.6% as of September 30,\n2023, compared to 12.3% as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, based on\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets (RWA). The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby net income and impacts from\nthe sales of certain Asia\nConsumer Banking (Asia\nConsumer) businesses, as well\nas business actions, including\na reduction in RWA, partially\noffset by the payment of\ncommon dividends and share\nrepurchases.\n\nDuring the third quarter of\n2023, Citi repurchased $0.5\nbillion of common shares and\npaid $1.0 billion of common\ndividends (see \u201cUnregistered\nSales of Equity Securities,\nRepurchases of Equity\nSecurities and Dividends\u201d\nbelow). Citi will continue to\nassess common share\nrepurchases on a quarter-by-\nquarter basis given\nuncertainty regarding\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. For additional\ninformation, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nStandards and Developments\u201d\nbelow.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of September\n30, 2023 was 6.0%, compared to\n5.7% as of September 30, 2022,\nand 5.8% as of December 31,\n2022. The increase was driven\nby higher Tier 1 Capital from\nnet income, partially offset\nby an increase in Total\nLeverage Exposure.

ICG operating expenses\nof $7.2 billion increased 10%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in risks and\ncontrols and volume-related\nexpenses, partially offset by\nproductivity savings.\n\nICG revenues of $10.6 billion\nincreased 12% (including gain\n(loss) on loan hedges), driven\nby growth across Services,\nMarkets and Banking, partially\noffset by an approximate $180\nmillion net impact from a\ncurrency devaluation in\nArgentina on Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in the country.\nRevenues also included a loss\non loan hedges of $47 million\nin the third quarter of 2023,\ncompared with a loss on loan\nhedges of $56 million in the\nprior-year period.\n\nServices revenues of $4.7\nbillion increased 13%. TTS\nrevenues of $3.6 billion\nincreased 12%, driven by 17%\ngrowth in net interest income\nand 1% growth in non-interest\nrevenue. The increase in TTS\nnet interest income was\nprimarily driven by higher\ninterest rates and deposit\nvolume growth. The increase in\nnon-interest revenue was\ndriven by continued growth in\nunderlying drivers, primarily\na 16% increase in cross-border\ntransaction value, a 6%\nincrease in U.S. dollar\nclearing volume and an 8%\nincrease in commercial card\nspend volume. The increase in\nnon-interest revenue was\nlargely offset by the impact\nfrom the currency devaluation\nin Argentina on Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in the country.\nSecurities services revenues\nof $1.1 billion increased 16%,\nlargely driven by higher net\ninterest income across\ncurrencies.\n\nMarkets revenues of $4.5\nbillion increased 10%, driven\nby an increase of 14% in Fixed\nincome markets, largely\nreflecting strength in rates\nand currencies. The increase\nwas partially offset by a\ndecrease of 3% in Equity\nmarkets, driven by a decline\nin equity derivatives,\npartially offset by growth in\nequity cash and prime\nservices.\n                               5                                \nBanking revenues of $1.4\nbillion increased 18%,\nincluding the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges in the current\nquarter and the prior-year\nperiod. Excluding the gain\n(loss) on loan hedges, Banking\nrevenues of $1.5 billion\nincreased 17%, driven by\nhigher revenues in Investment\nbanking. Investment banking\nrevenues of $844 million\nincreased 34%, reflecting\nincreased client activity in\ndebt underwriting and an\nabsence of certain realized\nand unrealized gains (losses)\nin the prior-year period.\nCorporate lending revenues\nincreased 2%, including the\nimpact of the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges. Excluding the\nimpact of the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges, Corporate lending\nrevenues increased 1% versus\nthe prior-year period.

Branded cards\nrevenues of $2.5 billion\nincreased 12%, primarily\ndriven by the higher net\ninterest income, as average\nloans increased 12%. Retail\nservices revenues of $1.7\nbillion increased 21%,\nprimarily driven by the higher\nnet interest income from loan\ngrowth, as well as the lower\npartner payments. Retail\nbanking revenues of $624\nmillion decreased 3%, largely\ndriven by the transfer of\ncertain relationships and the\nassociated deposits to Global\nWealth, partially offset by\nhigher deposit spreads.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues of $1.9\nbillion increased 2%,\nprimarily driven by higher\ninvestment product revenues\nacross all regions, the\nbenefit of the transfer of\ncertain relationships and the\nassociated deposits from\nRetail banking, and higher\nlending revenue.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nPBWM for the third quarter of\n2023, see \u201c Personal Banking\nand Wealth Management \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Legacy Franchises                                             \n                                                                \nLegacy Franchises net income\nwas $125 million, compared to\n$316 million in the prior-year\nperiod, primarily driven by\nlower revenues and higher cost\nof credit, partially offset by\nlower expenses. Legacy\nFranchises operating expenses\nof $1.8 billion decreased 3%,\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof exited markets and\ncontinued wind-downs,\npartially offset by separation\ncosts and the impact of FX\ntranslation in Mexico\n\nConsumer, Small Business and\nMiddle-Market Banking (Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM).\n\nLegacy Franchises revenues of\n$2.2 billion decreased 13%,\nlargely driven by the lower\ngain on sale impacts in Asia\nConsumer and reductions from\nexited markets and continued\nwind-downs.

In addition, these\nand other factors could\nadversely affect Citi\u2019s\ncustomers, clients,\nbusinesses, funding costs,\ncost of credit and overall\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition during the\nfourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAs previously disclosed in May\n2023, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC)\nissued a proposal that would\nimplement a special assessment\nto recover its uninsured\ndeposit losses from recent\nbank failures. The FDIC\nestimated that the preliminary\ncost of the failures is\napproximately $15.8 billion,\nan estimate that would be\nperiodically adjusted. The\nFDIC is proposing to collect\nthe special assessment at an\nannual rate of approximately\n12.5 basis points of uninsured\nU.S. deposits, over eight\nquarterly assessment periods\nbeginning in 2024. Citi is\nlikely to incur up to a $1.5\nbillion pretax charge,\nimpacting operating expenses,\nif the final rule for the FDIC\nspecial assessment, which is\nexpected before the end of\n2023, is enacted as proposed.\n                               6                                \nAdditionally, in July 2023,\nthe U.S. banking agencies\nissued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking, known as the Basel\nIII Endgame, related to\nregulatory capital\nrequirements that, if\nfinalized as proposed, would\nhave a material impact on\nCiti\u2019s current capital\nposition.

  \n(1) Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total\nrevenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items.\nFor example, securities that generate Net interest income may be\nrisk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a\ndescription of the composition of these revenue line items, see\nNotes 4, 5 and 6.\n\n(2) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion\nof the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans\nand loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on loan hedges includes the\nmark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market\non the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed\npremium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate\nlending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection.\nCitigroup\u2019s results of operations excluding the impact of gain\n(loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n\nThe discussion of the results of operations for ICG below\nexcludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges\nof accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures. For a\nreconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the\ntable above.\n                                                                \n  3Q23 vs. 3Q22                                                 \n                                                                \nNet income of $2.4 billion\nincreased 12%, primarily\ndriven by higher revenues,\npartially offset by higher\nexpenses and higher cost of\ncredit.\n\nRevenues increased 12%\n(including gain (loss) on loan\nhedges), driven by higher\nServices, Banking and Markets\nrevenues, partially offset by\nan approximate $180 million\nnet impact from a currency\ndevaluation in Argentina on\nCiti\u2019s net investment in the\ncountry. Services revenues\nwere up 13%, driven by higher\nrevenues in both TTS and\nSecurities services. Banking\nrevenues were up 18%\n(including the impact of the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges),\nreflecting higher revenues in\nboth Investment banking and\nCorporate lending. Markets\nrevenues were up 10%, driven\nby higher revenues in Fixed\nincome markets, partially\noffset by lower revenues in\nEquity markets.\n\nCiti expects revenues in its\nMarkets and Investment banking\nbusinesses will continue to\nreflect the overall market\nenvironment during the fourth\nquarter of 2023.\n\nWithin Services:\n\n\u2022 TTS revenues increased 12%,\ndriven by 17% growth in net\ninterest income and 1% growth\nin non-interest revenue,\nreflecting strong growth\nacross all client segments.\nThe increase in net interest\nincome was primarily driven by\nhigher interest rates as well\nas growth in deposits,\npartially offset by higher\ninterest rates paid on\ndeposits. Average deposits\nincreased 2%, largely driven\nby growth in EMEA, Asia and\nLatin America. On a quarter-\nover-quarter basis, average\ndeposits were down, mainly in\nNorth America, driven by\nportfolio optimization efforts\nand monetary tightening.\nAverage loans increased 2%,\nmainly driven by growth in\nLatin America and North\nAmerica. The increase in non-\ninterest revenue was driven by\nstrong fee growth in the cash\nbusiness, reflecting solid\nclient engagement and\ncontinued growth of underlying\ndrivers, including higher\ncross-border flows (up 16%),\nU.S. dollar clearing volume\n(up 6%) and commercial card\nspend (up 8%). The increase in\nnon-interest revenue was\nlargely offset by the impact\nfrom the currency devaluation\nin Argentina.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 16%, as net interest\nincome grew 36%, driven by\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies and cost of funds\nmanagement, partially offset\nby the impact of an 8% decline\nin average deposits. The\ndecline in average deposits\nreflected the impact of\nmonetary tightening. Non-\ninterest revenues increased\n3%, driven by higher fees due\nto higher assets under custody\nand administration and\ncontinued elevated levels of\ncorporation actions in Issuer\nservices. The increase in\n\nnon-interest revenue was\npartially offset by the impact\nfrom the currency devaluation\nin Argentina.\n\nWithin Markets:\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nincreased 14%, driven by North\nAmerica, largely reflecting\nstrength in rates and\ncurrencies despite continued\nlower market volatility.\n\nRates and currencies increased\n12%, driven by a conducive\nrate environment and\nassociated market-making\nactivity. Spread products and\nother fixed income revenues\nincreased 21%. This increase\nwas driven by North America,\nreflecting higher commodities\nrevenue, and growth in the\nfinancing and securitization\nbusiness, including increased\nclient or market activity.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\ndecreased 3%, driven by a\ndecline in equity derivatives,\npartially offset by growth in\nequity cash and prime\nservices. The decline in\nequity derivatives revenues\nreflected a more challenging\nmacroeconomic environment and\nlower volatility. The increase\nin equity cash revenue was\ndriven by increased client\nactivity. Prime services\nrevenues increased modestly\nand the business continued to\ngrow prime finance balances.\n\nWithin Banking:\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nincreased 34%, as strength in\nequity and debt underwriting\nwas partially offset by a\ndecline in advisory. Advisory\nrevenues decreased 21%,\nreflecting a decline in EMEA,\ndriven by macroeconomic\nuncertainties resulting in a\nlower market wallet, in\naddition to lower wallet\nshare. Equity underwriting\nrevenues increased 32%,\nreflecting growth in EMEA and\nNorth America, driven by\ngrowth in wallet share,\npartially offset by lower\nmarket wallet. Debt\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased 190%, reflecting\ngrowth in North America and\nEMEA, driven by wallet share\ngains, largely in investment\ngrade, as well as growth in\nleveraged loans. The increase\nin debt underwriting revenues\nalso reflected an absence of\ncertain realized and\nunrealized losses of $110\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, compared to gains of\n$16 million in the current-\nyear period.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nincreased 2%, including the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges.

Banking revenues\ndeclined 27% (including the\nimpact of the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges), reflecting lower\nrevenues in both Investment\nbanking and Corporate lending.\nMarkets revenues declined 3%,\ndriven by lower revenues in\nEquity markets, reflecting\nlower client activity, driven\nby decreased volatility and a\nstrong prior-year comparison.\n\nWithin Services:\n\n\u2022 TTS revenues increased 18%,\nwith growth in net interest\nincome of 24% and non-interest\nrevenue of 7%, largely driven\nby the same factors described\nabove.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 18%, reflecting\nhigher net interest income,\nlargely driven by the same\nfactors described above. Non-\ninterest revenue declined 3%,\nas a decrease in revenues in\nthe custody business and the\nimpact from the currency\ndevaluation in Argentina were\npartially offset by an\nincrease in Issuer services.\n\nWithin Markets:\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues were largely\nunchanged. Rates and\ncurrencies revenues increased\n4%, driven by strength in\nrates, partially offset by a\ndecline in the currencies\nbusiness, primarily reflecting\nlower volatility and a strong\nprior-year comparison. Spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome revenues decreased 11%,\ndriven by lower client\nactivity.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\ndecreased 14%, primarily due\nto a decline in equity\nderivatives, largely driven by\nthe same factors described\nabove, as well as a modest\ndecline in equity cash.\n\nWithin Banking:\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\ndecreased 9%. Advisory\nrevenues decreased 31%,\nprimarily driven by lower\nmarket wallet. Equity\nunderwriting revenues\ndecreased 13%, driven by lower\nwallet share.

Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, revenues\ndecreased 12%, primarily\ndriven by the impact of\nforeign currency translation,\nas well as lower volumes.\n\nExpenses increased 9%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, investments in\nTTS, other risk and controls\ninvestments, volume-related\nexpenses and other structural\nexpenses, including severance\ncosts, partially offset by\nproductivity savings and FX\ntranslation.\n\nProvisions reflected a cost of\n$182 million, compared to $855\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod.

The\nlower build was driven by the\nabsence of Russia-related ACL\nbuilds in the prior-year\nperiod. The lower build was\npartially offset by a $458\nmillion build for other\nassets, primarily related to\nan increase in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S. driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law.\n                               15                               \n                                                                \n  PERSONAL BANKING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT                        \n                                                                \nPersonal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM) consists of U.S.\nPersonal Banking and Global Wealth Management (Global Wealth).\nU.S. Personal Banking includes Branded cards and Retail\nservices, which have proprietary card portfolios (Cash, Rewards\nand Value) and co-branded cards (including Costco and American\nAirlines) within Branded cards, and co-brand and private label\nrelationships within Retail services (including, among others,\nThe Home Depot, Best Buy, Sears and Macy\u2019s).

Large\nbanking organizations, such as\nCiti, would be required to\ncalculate their risk-based\ncapital ratios under both the\nnew expanded risk-based\napproach and the Standardized\nApproach and use the lower of\nthe two for each risk-based\ncapital ratio for determining\nthe binding constraints.\n\nThe expanded risk-based\napproach is designed to align\nwith the international capital\nstandards adopted by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee).\nThe Basel Committee finalized\nthe Basel III reforms in\nDecember 2017, which included\nrevisions to the methodologies\nto determine credit, market\nand operational risk-weighted\nasset amounts.\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the\ncapital proposal\u2019s impact on\nrisk-weighted asset amounts\nwould also affect several\nother requirements including\nTLAC, external long-term debt\nand the short-term wholesale\nfunding score included in the\nGSIB surcharge under method 2\n(see \u201cGSIB Surcharge\u201d below\nfor additional changes in that\narea). The proposal has a\nthree-year transition period\nthat would begin on July 1,\n2025. Citi is currently\nreviewing the proposal and\nparticipating in the comment\nperiod. For additional\ninformation, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  GSIB Surcharge                                                \n                                                                \nSeparately, the Federal\nReserve Board proposed changes\nto the GSIB surcharge rule\nthat aim to make it more risk\nsensitive. Proposed changes\ninclude measuring certain\nsystemic indicators on a daily\nversus quarterly average\nbasis, changing certain of the\nrisk indicators and shortening\nthe time to come into\ncompliance with each year\u2019s\nsurcharge. In addition, the\nproposal would narrow\nsurcharge bands under method 2\nfrom 50 bps to 10 bps to\nreduce cliff effects when\nmoving between bands. This\nproposal is also subject to a\ncomment period and provides\nthat it would be effective two\nfull calendar quarters after\nits finalization.\n                                                                \n  Long-Term Debt Requirements                                   \n                                                                \nOn August 29, 2023, the\nFederal Reserve Board issued a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking\nto amend the TLAC rule to\nchange the haircuts (i.e., the\npercentage reductions) that\nare applied to eligible long-\nterm debt. The proposed\nrevisions are estimated to\ndecrease the TLAC percentage\nof Advanced Approaches RWA as\nwell as the TLAC percentage of\nTotal Leverage Exposure. This\nproposal, which Citi is\ncurrently reviewing, is\nsubject to a comment period\nand there is no proposed\ntransition period for its\nimplementation. The impact of\nthe proposed rule in its\ncurrent form is not expected\nto be material to Citi.\n                               34                               \nTangible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Return on\nEquity\n\nTangible common equity (TCE),\nas defined by Citi, represents\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity\nless goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nmortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs)).

On an\naverage basis, loans increased\n1% both year-over-year and\nsequentially as growth in PBWM\nwas largely offset by a\ndecline in ICG and Legacy\nFranchises. PBWM average loans\nincreased 7% year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by loan\ngrowth in cards, mortgages and\ninstallment lending. ICG\naverage loans decreased 4%\nyear-over-year, reflecting\nactions taken to reduce RWA.\nLegacy Franchises average\nloans decreased 5%, primarily\nreflecting the impact of the\ncontinued wind-downs,\nparticularly in Korea and\nChina, partially offset by\nhigher lending volumes in\nMexico Consumer. End-of-period\nloans increased 3% year-over-\nyear, as growth in PBWM ,\nreflecting an increase in U.S.\nPersonal Banking, was\npartially offset by declines\nin ICG and Legacy Franchises.\nEnd-of-period loans increased\n1% sequentially.\n                               38                               \n                                                                \n  CORPORATE CREDIT                                              \n                                                                \nThe following table details Citi\u2019s corporate credit portfolio\nwithin ICG and the Mexico SBMM component of Legacy Franchises\n(excluding certain loans managed on a delinquency basis, loans\ncarried at fair value and loans held-for-sale), and before\nconsideration of collateral or hedges, by remaining tenor for\nthe periods indicated:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) Includes drawn loans,\noverdrafts, bankers\u2019\nacceptances and leases.\n\n(2) Includes unused\ncommitments to lend, letters\nof credit and financial\nguarantees.\n\nPortfolio Mix\u2014Geography and\nCounterparty Citi\u2019s corporate\ncredit portfolio is diverse\nacross geography and\ncounterparty.

Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citi believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of September 30,\n2023. Citi has taken action to\nadjust internal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen.\n                               39                               \nAs obligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

As shown\nin the chart above, the third\nquarter of 2023 net credit\nloss rate in PBWM increased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, largely driven by a\ncontinued increase in net flow\nrates (due to certain loans\nmigrating into later-stage\ndelinquency buckets),\nprimarily reflecting the\nongoing normalization in\nBranded cards and Retail\nservices, including\nmacroeconomic pressures\nrelated to the higher\ninflationary and interest rate\nenvironment.

The portfolio is\ngenerally delinquency managed,\nwhere Citi evaluates credit\nrisk based on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 13. As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nbanking for the third quarter\nof 2023 was unchanged quarter-\nover-quarter, and increased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by growth and seasoning\nof the personal loans\nportfolio. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate was\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter, and decreased year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nlower delinquencies in U.S.\nmortgages.\n                 \n  Global Wealth  \n                 \nAs discussed above, the Global\nWealth credit portfolios\nprimarily consist of consumer\nmortgages, cards and other\nlending products extended to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom the affluent to ultra-\nhigh-net-worth through the\nPrivate bank, Wealth at Work\nand Citigold. These customer\nsegments represent a target\nmarket that is characterized\nby historically low default\nrates and delinquencies. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023,\napproximately $47 billion, or\n31%, of the portfolio was\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of margin\nlending, commercial real\nestate, subscription credit\nfinance and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit risk\nbased on their internal risk\nrating, of which 95% is rated\ninvestment grade. While the\ndelinquency rate in the chart\nabove is calculated only for\nthe delinquency-managed\n\nportfolio, the net credit loss\nrate is calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. For more\ninformation on Citi\u2019s total\ncommercial real estate\nexposure, see \u201cExposure to\nCommercial Real Estate\u201d within\nthe Corporate Credit section.\nAs shown in the chart above,\nthe net credit loss and 90+\ndays past due delinquency\nrates in Global Wealth for the\nthird quarter of 2023 were\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year.\nThe low levels of net credit\nlosses and the 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate continued\nto reflect the strong credit\nprofiles of the Global Wealth\nportfolios. Legacy Franchises\n                 \n  Asia Consumer  \n                 \nAsia Consumer provides credit\ncards, consumer mortgages and\nsmall business and personal\nloans. Asia Consumer also\nincludes loans and leases in\ncertain EMEA countries for all\nperiods presented. As\ndiscussed above, as of the\nthird quarter of 2023, Asia\nConsumer includes only the\nloan balances of the remaining\nconsumer banking portfolios\nheld-for-investment (China,\nKorea, Russia and Poland). As\nshown in the chart above, the\nnet credit loss rate in Asia\nConsumer for the third quarter\nof 2023 decreased quarter-\nover-quarter, driven by higher\nrecoveries, and increased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by lower average loans\ndue to the ongoing wind-downs\nof the remaining consumer\nbusinesses, particularly\nKorea, and the\nreclassification of the\nportfolio to HFS in the first\nquarter of 2023 (subsequently\nsold in the second quarter of\n2023). The 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate was broadly\nstable quarter-over-quarter\nand increased year-over-year.\nThe year-over-year increase\nwas mainly driven by lower\nloans due to the ongoing wind-\ndowns.\n                               46                               \n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex and\nprovides cards, consumer\nmortgages and small business\nand personal loans. Mexico\nConsumer serves a more mass-\nmarket segment in Mexico and\nfocuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As shown in\nthe chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in Mexico\nConsumer for the third quarter\nof 2023 increased quarter-\nover-quarter and year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by the\nongoing normalization of loss\nrates after peak losses\nexperienced during the\npandemic. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate decreased\nquarter-over-quarter, driven\nby the sale of delinquent\nloans of a portfolio segment,\nand increased year-over-year,\ndriven by the ongoing\nnormalization of delinquency\nrates after peak delinquencies\nexperienced during the\npandemic.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $61 million ($0.5 billion), $73 million ($0.5\nbillion) and $96 million ($0.6 billion) at September 30, 2023,\nJune 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $70 million, $68 million and $67 million at\nSeptember 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022,\nrespectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed\nloans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail\nservices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status, and therefore\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, 95%,\n97% and 95% of Global Wealth classifiably managed loans were\nrated investment grade.

Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nreclassifications commenced as follows: Bahrain, India,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22\n(Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and\nVietnam closed in 1Q23 and Taiwan closed in 3Q23). In addition,\na portfolio was reclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023\nand subsequently sold in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 2\nfor additional information.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $67 million ($0.2 billion), $77 million ($0.2\nbillion) and $95 million ($0.3 billion) at September 30, 2023,\nJune 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The amounts\nexcluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due\nEOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP\nloans) were $36 million, $31 million and $31 million at\nSeptember 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022,\nrespectively.

Corporate non-accrual\nloans may still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within\nCorporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\n(2) Approximately 62%, 51%, 61%, 50% and 68% of Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans were performing at September 30, 2023, June\n30, 2023, March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and September 30,\n2022, respectively.\n\n(3) The September 30, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans\nrepresented 0.68% of total cor porate loans .\n\n(4) Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries\nfor all periods presented.\n                                                                \n  Modified Loans                                                \n                                                                \nOn January 1, 2023, Citi\nadopted ASU 2022-02, which\neliminated the accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for\nTDRs (see Note 1 for\nadditional information).

On an average\nbasis, deposits were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a\nmodest increase in Legacy Franchises was offset by a decline in\nPBWM , and declined 2% sequentially. The increase in Legacy\nFranchises average deposits year-over-year was primarily driven\nby the impact of FX translation in Mexico Consumer/SBMM. PBWM\naverage deposits decreased 2% year-over-year, largely reflecting\nclients putting cash to work in investments on Citi\u2019s platform.\nICG and Corporate/Other average deposits were largely unchanged\nyear-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in average\ndeposits was largely driven by Services, reflecting the impact\nof monetary tightening. End-of-period deposits decreased 3%\nyear-over-year, largely due to a reduction in Services,\nreflecting monetary tightening, a shift of deposits to higher-\nyielding investments in Global Wealth and a reduction of\ninstitutional certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other. End-\nof-period deposits decreased 4% sequentially, driven by ICG ,\nPBWM and Legacy Franchises , partially offset by Corporate/Other\n. The majority of Citi\u2019s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period deposits\nare institutional (approximately $782 billion), and span\napproximately 90 countries. A large majority of these\ninstitutional deposits are within TTS, and of these,\napproximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS\nintegrated services: payments and collections, liquidity\nmanagement and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly\n80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a greater than\n15-year relationship with Citi. On an average basis, TTS grew\ndeposits year-over-year at a faster rate than total Citi. Citi\nalso has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with $416\nbillion of U.S. Personal Banking and Global Wealth end-of-period\ndeposits, which are diversified across the Private bank,\nCitigold, Retail banking and Wealth at Work. As of August 2023,\napproximately 80% of U.S. Citigold deposit balances are with\nclients who have been with Citi for more than 10 years and\napproximately 60% of Private bank ultra-high-net-worth deposit\nbalances are with clients who have been with Citi for more than\n10 years.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup) and Citi\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries\n(including\n\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into\nCitigroup. As of September 30, 2023, non-bank included $90.6\nbillion of long-term debt issued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer and\nother subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup. Certain\nCitigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in\nthis line. (2) Local country and other includes debt issued by\nCiti\u2019s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within\nnon-bank, certain secured financing is also included. (3)\nPredominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by\nBranded cards receivables. Citi\u2019s total long-term debt\noutstanding increased 9% year-over-year, largely driven by\nissuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank entities, as\nwell as increased senior benchmark debt and FHLB borrowings at\nthe bank. The increase was partially offset by a decline in\nsenior benchmark debt at the non-bank entities, as well as lower\nsecuritizations at the bank. Sequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding was largely unchanged, reflecting a decline in\ncustomer-related debt at the non-bank, offset by an increase in\nsenior benchmark debt at the bank. As part of its liability\nmanagement, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider,\nopportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt\npursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means.\nSuch redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During the third quarter of 2023, Citi redeemed\nor repurchased an aggregate of approximately $5.7 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               58

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nwith a smaller portion\nexecuted through Citi\u2019s bank\nentities to efficiently fund\nboth (i) secured lending\nactivity and (ii) a portion of\nthe securities inventory held\nin the context of market\nmaking and customer\nactivities. Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $257\nbillion as of September 30,\n2023 increased 27% year-over-\nyear, largely driven by\nadditional financing to\nsupport increases in trading-\nrelated assets within Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries. As\nof the quarter ended September\n30, 2023, on an average basis,\nsecured funding was $275\nbillion. The portion of\nsecured funding in the broker-\ndealer subsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity and is primarily\nsecured by high-quality liquid\nsecurities such as U.S.\nTreasury securities, U.S.\nagency securities and foreign\ngovernment debt securities.\nOther \u201cmatched book\u201d activity\nis secured by less liquid\nsecurities, including equity\nsecurities, corporate bonds\nand asset-backed securities,\nthe tenor of which is\ngenerally equal to or longer\nthan the tenor of the\ncorresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $43 billion as of the third\nquarter of 2023 decreased 9%\nyear-over-year and increased\n7% sequentially, driven by\nhigher commercial paper (see\nNote 17 for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               60                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nThe table below presents the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of September 30,\n2023.

Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfinancing transactions and\nother margin requirements, for\nwhich there are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.4\nbillion, compared to $0.4\nbillion as of June 30, 2023.\nOther funding sources, such as\nsecured funding transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of September 30,\n2023, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup and Citibank across\nall three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$0.7 billion, compared to $0.8\nbillion as of June 30, 2023\n(see also Note 19). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of September\n30, 2023, Citibank had\nliquidity commitments of\napproximately $11.0 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\nwhich was largely unchanged\nfrom June 30, 2023 (see Note\n20 for additional\ninformation).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could\nreevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis reevaluation could result\nin clients adjusting their\ndiscretionary deposit levels\nor changing their depository\ninstitution, which could\npotentially reduce certain\ndeposit levels at Citibank.\nHowever, Citi could choose to\nadjust pricing, offer\nalternative deposit products\nto its existing customers or\nseek to attract deposits from\nnew customers, in addition to\nthe mitigating actions\nreferenced above.\n                               61                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Banking Book Interest Rate Risk                               \n                                                                \nFor interest rate risk\npurposes, Citi\u2019s non-trading\nportfolios are referred to as\nthe Banking Book. Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset &\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from the second line\nof defense team reporting to\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in the level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rates\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in the maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in the interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nSince the third quarter of\n2022, Citi has employed\nenhanced IRE methodologies and\nchanges to certain\nassumptions. The changes\nincluded, among other things,\nassumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet and\nrevisions to the treatment of\ncertain business contributions\n(notably accrual positions in\nICG \u2019s Markets businesses).\nThese changes resulted in a\nhigher impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income over a\n12-month period.\n\nUnder the enhanced\nmethodology, Citi utilizes the\nmost recent quarter-end\nbalance sheet, assuming no\nchanges to its composition and\nsize over the forecasted\nhorizon (holding the balance\nsheet static). The forecasts\nincorporate expectations and\nassumptions of deposit\npricing, loan spreads and\nmortgage prepayment behavior\nimplied by the interest rate\ncurves in each scenario. The\nbase case scenario reflects\nthe market-implied forward\ninterest rates, and\nsensitivity scenarios assume\ninstantaneous shocks to the\nbase case. The forecasts do\nnot assume Citi takes any\nrisk-mitigating actions in\nresponse to changes in the\ninterest rate environment.\nCertain interest rates are\nsubject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities (i.e., deposit\nbetas), are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n\nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nvalue at risk (VAR). It\nexcludes impacts from any\npositions that are included in\ntotal trading and credit\nportfolio VAR.\n\nIn addition to IRE, Citi\nanalyzes economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) as a longer-\nterm interest rate risk\nmetric. EVS is a net present\nvalue (NPV)\u2013based measure of\nthe lifetime cash flows of\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book. It\nestimates the interest rate\nsensitivity of the Banking\nBook\u2019s economic value from\nlonger-term assets being\npotentially funded with\nshorter-term liabilities, or\nvice versa.

For\nnon-U.S. dollar currencies,\nexposure to downward rate\nshocks is smaller in magnitude\nas a result of Citi\u2019s flooring\nassumption, given low rate\nlevels for certain non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 compared to Scenario 3. This\nis because the combination of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio, partially offset by\nchanges related to Citi\u2019s\npension liabilities, results\nin a net position that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                               64                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.7 billion,\nor 0.96%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\nMexican peso, Euro and Indian\nrupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies.\n\nThis, coupled with Citi\u2019s\nforeign currency hedging\nstrategies, such as foreign\ncurrency borrowings, foreign\ncurrency forwards and other\ncurrency hedging instruments,\nlessens the impact of foreign\ncurrency movements on Citi\u2019s\nCET1 Capital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

The\nincrease in net interest\nincome in non- ICG Markets\nprimarily reflected higher\ninterest rates and growth in\nU.S. cards interest-earning\nbalances, partially offset by\na reduction in net interest\nincome due to the exited\nmarkets and continued wind-\ndowns in Legacy Franchises .\nThe increase in ICG Markets\nnet interest income was\nprimarily driven by higher\ninterest rates as well as a\nchange in the mix of trading\npositions in support of client\nactivity.\n\nCiti\u2019s net interest margin was\n2.49% on a taxable equivalent\nbasis in the third quarter of\n2023, an increase of 1 basis\npoint from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by beneficial\nbalance sheet mix changes and\nhigher interest rates, largely\noffset by the absence of the\nbenefit of dividend\nseasonality in ICG Markets in\nthe prior quarter.\n                               67                               \n                                                                \n  Additional Interest Rate

type. The benefit reflects the\nfact that the risks within individual and across risk types are\nnot perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a\ngiven day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to\neach risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of\nchanges to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination\nof the impact of both model parameter and position changes.\n\n(2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain\nfair value option trading positions in ICG , with the exception\nof hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all\nCVA exposures.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of September 30, 2023, there were two\nback-testing exceptions observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR in\nthe last 12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n                               73                               \n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of September 30, 2023.\n(Including the U.S., Citi\u2019s\ntop 25 exposures by country\nwould represent approximately\n98% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries as of September 30,\n2023.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower. For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China.

in \u201cDeconsolidation\nRisk\u201d below.\n                               75                               \nDuring the third quarter of\n2023, Citi\u2019s Russia-related\nexposures decreased by $0.7\nbillion, as shown in the table\nabove. The decrease in\nexposure was driven by a $0.7\nbillion depreciation of the\nruble against the U.S. dollar.\nDuring the period, inflows\nfrom dividends received from\nRussian corporations on behalf\nof Citi\u2019s clients were fully\noffset by deposit outflows and\ntax payments to local\nauthorities. Approximately 68%\nof Citi\u2019s remaining exposures\nin Russia are trapped\ndividends that Citi cannot\nremit to its clients due to\nrestrictions imposed by the\nRussian government, of which\n$3.5 billion is held with the\nDeposit Insurance Agency as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $1.0\nbillion as of September 30,\n2023 (down slightly from $1.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2023).\nCiti hedges its ruble/USD spot\nFX exposure in AOCI through\nthe purchase of FX\nderivatives. The ongoing mark-\nto-market of the hedging\nderivatives is also reported\nin AOCI . When the ruble\ndepreciates against the USD,\nthe USD equivalent value of\nCitigroup\u2019s investment in AO\nCitibank also declines. This\nchange in value is offset by\nthe change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative). Going forward,\nCiti may record devaluations\non its net ruble-denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nthe benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposures.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ICG , PBWM and Legacy\nFranchises segments and\nCorporate/Other have been\nimpacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\nand its direct and indirect\nimpact on the European and\nglobal economies. For a\nbroader discussion of these\nfactors and volatilities on\nCiti\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$0.1 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct\nRussian counterparties\n(compared to $0.2 billion at\nJune 30, 2023).\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbanking businesses, including\nactively pursuing portfolio\nsales. In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi has incurred\napproximately $55 million to-\ndate in charges, largely from\nrestructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other\nrelated charges. Citi expects\nto incur an additional\napproximate $85 million in\nestimated charges\n(approximately $10 million in\nICG and $65 million in Legacy\nFranchises , and $10 million\nin Corporate/Other excluding\nthe impact from any portfolio\nsales). This estimate was\nrevised down during the third\nquarter from $180 million at\nJune 30, 2023. During the\nthird quarter, as part of the\npreviously disclosed cards\nreferral agreement with a\nRussian bank, approximately\n$26 million of credit card\nreceivables was settled upon\nreferral and refinanced.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, Citi\ncontinued to consolidate AO\nCitibank because none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank Russia, Citi\u2019s\nforeign entity in Russia, Citi\nwould be required to (i) write\noff the net investment of\napproximately $1.0 billion\n(down slightly from $1.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2023),\n(ii) recognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\n(compared to $1.6 billion as\nof June 30, 2023) through\nearnings and (iii) recognize a\nloss of $0.6 billion (compared\nto $0.4 billion as of June 30,\n2023) on intercompany\nliabilities owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russia-related Clients               \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients as a\nresult of sanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or\n                               76                               \nblock the funds until\napplicable sanctions are\nlifted or the payment is\notherwise authorized under\napplicable law.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its current presence\nin Russia and association with\nRussian individuals or\nentities, whether subject to\nsanctions or not, including\nCiti\u2019s inability to support\nits global clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses. Citi has\nconsidered the potential for\nreputation risk and taken\nactions to mitigate such\nrisks. Citi established a\nRussia Special Review Process\nwith management\u2019s Reputation\nRisk Committee with oversight\nfor significant Russia-related\nreputation risks and completed\na number of reputation risk\nreviews of matters with a\nRussian nexus.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

In\naddition to receiving regular\nbriefings from management, the\nfull Board has routinely been\ninvited to attend portions of\nthe RMC meetings for\ndiscussions related to the war\nin Ukraine, including with\nrespect to Citi\u2019s risk\nexposures and stress testing.\nThe reports to the Board and\nits Committees from senior\nmanagement who represent the\nimpacted businesses and the\nEMEA region, Independent Risk\nManagement, Finance,\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement, including those\nindividuals responsible for\nsanctions compliance, and\nHuman Resources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its ICG businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 230\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. Citi\u2019s\nexposures in Ukraine are not\nsignificant enough to be\nincluded in the \u201cTop 25\nCountry Exposures\u201d table\nabove. As of September 30,\n2023, Citi had $1.5 billion of\ndirect exposures related to\nUkraine, compared to $1.3\nbillion as of June 30, 2023.\nThe increase in exposures\nreflected a $0.2 billion\nincrease in deposits.\n                               77                               \n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its ICG businesses. As\nof September 30, 2023, Citi\u2019s\nnet investment in its\nArgentine operations was\napproximately $1.9 billion\n(unchanged from June 30,\n2023). Under U.S. GAAP, Citi\nuses the U.S. dollar as the\nfunctional currency for its\noperations in countries such\nas Argentina that are deemed\nhighly inflationary. Citi\ntherefore records the impact\nof exchange rate fluctuations\non its net Argentine peso\n(ARS)\u2013denominated assets\ndirectly in earnings.\nAccordingly, Citi seeks to\nreduce its overall ARS\nexposure in Argentina while\ncomplying with local capital\nand currency exposure\nlimitations.\n\nFrom Citi\u2019s total net\ninvestment in Argentina of\napproximately $1.9 billion, as\nof September 30, 2023, Citi\u2019s\nnet ARS exposure was\napproximately $1.3 billion\n(compared to $1.6 billion at\nJune 30, 2023). The net ARS\nexposure has decreased as a\nresult of Citi purchasing an\nadditional approximate $200\nmillion of certain local\ngovernment bonds during the\nthird quarter (for a total of\n$500 million in these bonds).\nThese bonds are indexed to the\nhigher of the U.S. dollar\n(USD) exchange rate or the\nlocal inflation index. Citi\nalso originated approximately\n$50 million of USD-denominated\nloans during the third\nquarter. Such bonds and USD-\ndenominated loans may reduce\nthe impact to Citi of a\npotential currency devaluation\nin the future, although it\nremains unclear how effective\nCiti\u2019s strategies to reduce\nits ARS exposure may be.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nCentral Bank of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat generally restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access U.S. dollars\nin Argentina and remit\nearnings from its Argentine\noperations. As a result,\nCiti\u2019s net investment in its\nArgentine operations is likely\nto continue to increase as\nCiti generates net income in\nits Argentine franchise and\nits earnings cannot be\nremitted. Due to the currency\ncontrols implemented by the\nCentral Bank of Argentina,\ncertain indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms have\ndeveloped that some Argentine\nentities may use to obtain\nU.S. dollars, generally at\nrates that are significantly\nhigher than Argentina\u2019s\nofficial exchange rate.\nCitibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. Citibank Argentina\ntherefore uses Argentina\u2019s\nofficial market exchange rate\nto remeasure its net ARS\nassets into the U.S. dollar,\nwhich was 350.0 ARS to 1 U.S.\ndollar as of September 30,\n2023. During the third\nquarter, the Central Bank of\nArgentina devalued the\nofficial exchange rate by 27%,\nresulting in an approximate\n$180 million net negative\nimpact to Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in the country. For\nadditional information on this\nimpact to Citi, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and \u201c Institutional\nClients Group \u201d above.\n\nIf Argentina\u2019s official\nexchange rate further\nconverges with the approximate\nrate implied by the indirect\nforeign exchange mechanisms,\nCiti could incur a significant\nloss on its capital in\nArgentina. Current\nmacroeconomic conditions in\nthe country, along with\nsustained high inflation, low\ninternational reserves held by\nthe Central Bank of Argentina\nand the foreign currency\npolicy decisions following the\nupcoming general presidential\nelections in Argentina, may\nresult in an accelerated or\nsteep depreciation of the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nnear term. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti may economically hedge\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet ARS-denominated assets to\nthe extent possible and\nprudent using non-deliverable\nforward (NDF) derivative\ninstruments that are primarily\nexecuted outside of Argentina.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the\ninternational NDF market had\nvery limited liquidity,\nresulting in Citi\u2019s inability\nto economically hedge\nsubstantially all of its ARS\nexposure. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute NDF contracts for this\nunhedged exposure in the\nfuture, Citi would record\ndevaluations on its net ARS-\ndenominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished an appropriate ACL\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. However,\nCiti may need to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, resulting in higher\nICG cost of credit, should\nthere be an increase in\ntransfer risk associated with\nits Argentine exposures. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s emerging markets risks,\nincluding those related to its\nArgentine exposures, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n                               78                               \nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT\nESTIMATES\n\nThis section contains a\nsummary of Citi\u2019s most\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A portion of\nthese assets and liabilities\nis reflected at fair value on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet as Trading account\nassets , Available-for-sale\nsecurities and Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. The fair value of\nthese instruments is reported\non Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet with the changes in fair\nvalue recognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses, and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 22 and 23 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K.\n                               79                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below presents\nCiti\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\ntotal ACL as of the third\nquarter of 2023.

See Notes 1 and 14.\n\nCiti\u2019s reserves for expected\ncredit losses on funded loans\nand for unfunded lending\ncommitments, standby letters\nof credit and financial\nguarantees are reflected on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet\nin the Allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\nOther liabilities (for\nAllowance for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC)), respectively. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and\n\nother financial receivables\nare reflected in Other assets\n. These reserves, together\nwith the ACLL and ACLUC, are\nreferred to as the ACL.\nChanges in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover an R&S timeframe. The R&S\nforecast period for consumer\nand corporate credit exposures\nis eight quarters.\n                               80                               \nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects risks and\ncertain economic conditions\nnot fully captured in the\nquantitative component. Both\nthe quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\nQuantitative Component Citi\nestimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions. For its consumer\nand corporate portfolios,\nCiti\u2019s expected credit losses\nare determined primarily by\nutilizing models that consider\nthe borrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables, including housing\nprices, unemployment rate and\nreal GDP, and cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry,\nproduct and business segments.\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates, as well\nas other credit trends.\nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes\nrisks that are not fully\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent. These may include\nbut are not limited to\nportfolio characteristics,\nidiosyncratic events, factors\nnot within historical loss\ndata or the economic forecast,\nuncertainty in the environment\nand other factors as required\nby banking supervisory\nguidance for the ACL. The\nprimary examples of these are:\n\u2022 Normalization of portfolio\nperformance and consumer\nbehavior from low losses as a\nresult of government stimulus\nand market liquidity during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic \u2022\nPotential impacts on\nvulnerable industries and\nregions due to emerging\nmacroeconomic risks and\nuncertainties, including those\nrelated to potential global\nrecession, inflation, interest\nrates, commodity prices and\ngeopolitical tensions \u2022\nTransfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S. for\ncertain safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law As of the third\nquarter of 2023, Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the\nACL continued to decline\nquarter-over-quarter. The\ndecline was primarily driven\nby releases of\nCOVID-19\u2013related uncertainty\nreserves, as the portfolio\ncontinues to normalize toward\npre-pandemic levels and as\nrisks are captured in the\nquantitative component of the\nACL. These releases were\npartially offset by a build\nfor\n\nmacroeconomic risks and\nuncertainties impacting\nvulnerable industries and\nregions in the corporate\nportfolio, including continued\nhigh interest rates.\nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nconsiders a multitude of\nglobal macroeconomic variables\nfor the base, upside and\ndownside probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL. The\ntables below present Citi\u2019s\nforecasted quarterly average\nU.S. unemployment rate and\nyear-over-year U.S. real GDP\ngrowth rate used in\ndetermining the base\nmacroeconomic forecast for\nCiti\u2019s ACL for each quarterly\nreporting period from 3Q22 to\n3Q23:\n                                                                \n             Quarterly                                          \n               average                                          \n  U.S.            4Q23       2Q24       4Q24       8-quart\u2026     \n  unempl\u2026                                          average\u2026     \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.3  %     4.0  %     4.0  %         4.0  %  \n  at 3Q22                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.7        4.5        4.4            4.4     \n  at 4Q22                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.3        4.6        4.5            4.3     \n  at 1Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          4.1        4.5        4.5            4.3     \n  at 2Q23                                                       \n  Citi                                                          \n  foreca\u2026          3.9        4.3        4.4            4.2     \n  at 3Q23                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) Represents the average\nunemployment rate for the\nrolling, forward-looking eight\nquarters in the forecast\nhorizon.\n                                                                \n                       Year-over-year                           \n                       growth rate(1)                           \n                            Full year                           \n  U.S. real GDP                  2023       2024       2025     \n  Citi forecast                   0.6  %     1.9  %     2.7  %  \n  at 3Q22                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   0.3        1.5        2.2     \n  at 4Q22                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.0        1.0        2.0     \n  at 1Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   1.3        0.7        2.0     \n  at 2Q23                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   2.1        1.0        2.0     \n  at 3Q23                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The year-over-year growth\nrate is the percentage change\nin the real (inflation\nadjusted) GDP level. Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 3Q23, U.S. real GDP growth\nis expected to decline in the\nlast quarter of 2023 before\nrecovering in 2024, while the\nunemployment rate is expected\nto increase modestly over the\neight-quarter forecast\nhorizon, broadly returning to\npre-pandemic levels. Scenario\nWeighting Citi\u2019s ACL is\nestimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario. For example,\ncompared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nreflects a severe recession,\nincluding an elevated\n                               81                               \naverage U.S. unemployment rate\nof 6.8% over the eight-quarter\nR&S period, with a peak\ndifference of 3.2% in the\nfirst quarter of 2025. The\ndownside scenario also\nreflects a year-over-year U.S.\nreal GDP contraction in 2024\nof 2.5%, with a peak quarter-\nover-quarter difference to the\nbase scenario of 1.2% in the\nfourth quarter of 2023.\n\nCiti\u2019s ACL is sensitive to the\nvarious macroeconomic\nscenarios that drive the\nquantitative component of\nexpected credit losses due to\nchanges in the length and\nseverity of forecasted\neconomic variables or events\nin the respective scenarios.\nTo demonstrate this\nsensitivity, Citi applied 100%\nweight to the downside\nscenario as of September 30,\n2023, to reflect the most\nsevere economic deterioration\nforecast in the multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe weighted scenario\nassumptions; therefore,\napplying a 100% downside\nscenario weight would result\nin a hypothetical increase in\nthe ACL of approximately $4.8\nbillion related to lending\nexposures, except for loans\nindividually evaluated for\ncredit losses.\n\nThis analysis does not\nincorporate any impacts or\nchanges to the qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL. These\nfactors could change the\noutcome of the sensitivity\nanalysis based on historical\nexperience and current\nconditions at the time of the\nassessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of September\n30, 2023.\n\n3Q23 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for\nthe third quarter of 2023 was\n$20.2 billion, compared to\n$20.1 billion as of June 30,\n2023. The net build of $0.2\nbillion was primarily driven\nby growth in card balances in\nPBWM and corporate builds\nprimarily related to specific\nrisks and uncertainties\nimpacting vulnerable\nindustries and regions,\npartially offset by\nimprovement in key\nmacroeconomic variable\nforecasts . Citi believes its\nanalysis of the ACL reflects\nthe forward view of the\neconomic environment as of\nSeptember 30, 2023. See Note\n14 for additional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. cards\n(Branded cards and Retail\nservices) in U.S. Personal\nBanking. Citi\u2019s total consumer\nACLL build was $0.1 billion in\nthe third quarter of 2023,\nprimarily driven by growth in\nU.S. cards balances, resulting\nin a September 30, 2023 ACLL\nbalance of $14.9 billion, or\n3.95% of total funded consumer\nloans.\n\nFor U.S. cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans decreased to\n7.81% at September 30, 2023,\ndue to macroeconomic\nimprovement, compared to 7.86%\nat June 30, 2023. For the\nremaining consumer exposures,\nthe level of reserves relative\nto total funded loans was\n1.24% at September 30, 2023,\ncompared to 1.28% at June 30,\n2023.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nbuild of $0.1 billion in the\nthird quarter of 2023. The\nbuild was primarily driven by\nspecific risks and\nuncertainties impacting\nvulnerable industries and\nregions, partially offset by\nimproved key macroeconomic\nvariable forecasts.

The decrease for the third quarter was primarily from\nincome in Other comprehensive income , and the year-to-date\nincrease was primarily a result of Citi\u2019s geographic mix of\nearnings. Of Citi\u2019s $28.3 billion of net DTAs, $11.2 billion\n(compared to $11.7 billion at June 30, 2023) was deducted in\ncalculating Citi\u2019s regulatory capital, and the remaining $17.1\nbillion was appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III\nrules.

DTA Realizability Citi believes that\nrealization of the net DTAs of $28.3 billion at September 30,\n2023 is more-likely-than-not, based on management\u2019s expectations\nof future taxable income generation in the jurisdictions in\nwhich the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax\nplanning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes\n).\n                               83                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of September 30,\n2023 and for the three- and\nnine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\ninclude the accounts of\nCitigroup Inc. and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries. In\nthe opinion of management, all\nadjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded within Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31,\n2022 (2022 Form 10-K),\nCitigroup\u2019s Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended March 31, 2023 (First\nQuarter of 2023 Form 10-Q) and\nCitigroup\u2019s Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended June 30, 2023 (Second\nQuarter of 2023 Form 10-Q).\nCertain financial information\nthat is normally included in\nannual financial statements\nprepared in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP),\nbut is not required for\ninterim reporting purposes,\nhas been condensed or omitted.\nManagement must make estimates\nand assumptions that affect\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the related\nfootnote disclosures. While\nmanagement uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nCash equivalents are defined\nas those amounts included in\nCash and due from banks and\npredominately all of Deposits\nwith banks . Cash flows from\nrisk management activities are\nclassified in the same\ncategory as the related assets\nand liabilities. Amounts\nincluded in Cash and due from\nbanks and Deposits with banks\napproximate fair value.\n\nUPDATED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES The accounting\npolicies below have been\nupdated from those disclosed\nin Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K for\nthe effects of accounting\nstandards adopted during the\nfirst quarter of 2023. See\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K for a summary\nof all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. Allowances for\nCredit Losses (ACL) Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi adopted\nthe Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB)\nAccounting Standards Update\n(ASU) No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures under the\nmethodology described below.\nFor information about Citi\u2019s\naccounting for troubled debt\nrestructurings (TDRs) prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023, see Note 1 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. ACCOUNTING CHANGES TDRs\nand Vintage Disclosures In\nMarch 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures . Citi adopted the\nASU on January 1, 2023,\nincluding the guidance on the\nrecognition and measurement of\nTDRs under the modified\nretrospective approach.\nAdopting these amendments\nresulted in a decrease to the\nACLL of $ 352million and an\nincrease in other assets\nrelated to held-for-sale\nbusinesses of $ 44million,\nwith a corresponding increase\nto retained earnings of $\n290million and a decrease in\ndeferred tax assets of $\n106million on January 1, 2023.\nThe ACL for corporate loans\nwas unaffected because the\nmeasurement approach used for\ncorporate loans is not in the\nscope of this ASU. ASU 2022-02\neliminates the accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for\nTDRs, including the\nrequirement to measure the\nACLL for TDRs using a\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF)\napproach. With the elimination\nof TDR accounting\nrequirements, reasonably\nexpected TDRs are no longer\nconsidered when determining\nthe term over which to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses. The ACLL for modified\nloans that are collateral\ndependent continues to be\nbased on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Consumer Loans\nUpon adoption of the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi\ndiscontinued the use of a DCF\napproach for consumer loans\nformerly considered TDRs.\nBeginning January 1, 2023,\nCiti measures the ACLL for all\nconsumer loans under\napproaches that do not\nincorporate discounting,\nprimarily utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default, loss\ngiven default and exposure at\ndefault. In addition, upon\nadoption of the ASU, Citi\ncollectively evaluates\nsmaller-balance homogeneous\nloans formerly considered TDRs\nfor expected\n                               98                               \ncredit losses, whereas\npreviously those loans had\nbeen individually evaluated.\nThe ASU also requires\ndisclosure of modifications of\nloans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty if the modification\ninvolves principal\nforgiveness, an interest rate\nreduction, an other-than-\ninsignificant payment delay, a\nterm extension or a\ncombination of those types of\nmodifications. In addition,\nthe ASU requires the\ndisclosure of current-period\ngross write-offs by year of\nloan origination (vintage).\nThe amendments related to\ndisclosures are required to be\napplied prospectively\nbeginning as of the date of\nadoption. See Note 13 for\nthese new disclosures for\nperiods beginning on and after\nJanuary 1, 2023. Long-Duration\nInsurance Contracts In August\n2018, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2018-12, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Targeted\nImprovements to the Accounting\nfor Long-Duration Contracts ,\nwhich changes the existing\nrecognition, measurement,\npresentation and disclosures\nfor long-duration contracts\nissued by an insurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i)\nimproves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the\nliability for future policy\nbenefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future\ncash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the\naccounting for certain market-\nbased options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or\naccount balance) contracts,\n(iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred\nacquisition costs and (iv)\nintroduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries,\nprimarily in Mexico, that\nissue long-duration insurance\ncontracts such as traditional\nlife insurance policies and\nlife-contingent annuity\ncontracts that are impacted by\nthe requirements of ASU\n2018-12. Citi adopted the\ntargeted improvements in ASU\n2018-12 on January 1, 2023,\nresulting in a $ 39million\ndecrease in Other liabilities\nand a $ 27million increase in\nAOCI , after-tax.\n\nFUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES\nAccounting for Investments in\nTax Credit Structures In March\n2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023\u201002, Investments\u2014Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures\n(Topic 323): Accounting for\nInvestments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the\nProportional Amortization\nMethod . The ASU expands the\nscope of tax equity\ninvestments eligible to apply\nthe proportional amortization\nmethod of accounting. Under\nthe proportional amortization\nmethod, the cost of an\neligible investment is\namortized in proportion to the\nincome tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits that are\nreceived by the investor, with\nthe amortization of the\ninvestment and the income tax\ncredits being presented net in\nthe income statement as\ncomponents of income tax\nexpense (benefit). The ASU\nwill permit the Company to\nelect to use the proportional\namortization method to account\nfor all eligible tax equity\ninvestments, regardless of the\ntax credit program from which\nthe income tax credits are\nreceived, if certain\nconditions are met. Citi plans\nto adopt the ASU on January 1,\n2024 and does not expect a\nmaterial impact to its results\nof operations as a result of\nadopting the standard. Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\n. The ASU was issued to\naddress diversity in practice\nwhereby certain entities\nincluded the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when\nvaluing equity securities, and\nit clarifies that a\ncontractual restriction on the\nsale of an equity security\nshould not be considered part\nof the unit of account of the\nequity security and,\ntherefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair\nvalue. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to\ndisclose the fair value of\nequity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions,\nthe nature and remaining\nduration of the restrictions\nand the circumstances that\ncould cause a lapse in the\nrestrictions.\n\nThe ASU will be effective for\nCiti on January 1, 2024 and is\nnot expected to have an impact\non Citi\u2019s operating results or\nfinancial position.\n                               99                               \n2.

As a result, a CTA\nloss (net of hedges) in AOCI\nof approximately $ 400million\npretax ($ 345million after-\ntax) related to the legacy\noperation was released to\nearnings in the second quarter\nof 2022. Out of the total CTA\nrelease, a $ 260million pretax\nloss ($ 221million after-tax\nloss) was attributable to the\nEgg Banking business noted\nabove, reported in\nDiscontinued operations , and\ntherefore the corresponding\nCTA release was also reported\nin Discontinued operations\nduring the second quarter of\n2022.

These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that an increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other\npartner payments are based on program sales and new account\nacquisitions.\n(2) Overdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310.

1974, as\namended (ERISA), funding rules as of January 1, 2023 and no\nminimum required funding is expected for 2023.\n(2) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n(3) The framework for the Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump-sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n(4) During 2023, the actuarial gain is primarily due to the\nincrease in global discount rates.\n                              110                               \nThe following table presents the change in AOCI related to the\nCompany\u2019s pension,

A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value\noption, as described in Notes 22 and 23. The remaining portion\nis carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 23. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the\nsecurities, which is reflected in the table above.

Upon adoption,\nCiti transferred $ 3.3billion of mortgage-backed securities from\nHTM classification to AFS classification as allowed under the\nASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an\nunrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion, which was recorded in\nAOCI upon transfer .

Value\n\nNon-marketable equity\nsecurities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost.\n\nThe election to measure a non-\nmarketable equity security\nusing the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\n\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired. For\ndetails on impairment\nindicators that are\nconsidered, see Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nWhen the qualitative\nassessment indicates that the\nequity security is impaired,\nits fair value is determined.\nIf the fair value of the\ninvestment is less than its\ncarrying value, the investment\nis written down to fair value\nthrough earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative at\nSeptember 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 :\n                                                                \n  In millions of         September 30,                          \n  dollars                         2023       December 31, 2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value      $          1,621    $              1,676  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized\nin earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable\nequity securities measured\nusing the measurement\nalternative:\n                                                                \n  In                Three                      Nine             \n  millio\u2026          Months                    Months             \n  of                Ended                     Ended             \n  dollars       September                  Septemb\u2026             \n  Measur\u2026             30,                       30,             \n  altern\u2026            2023       2022           2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impair\u2026    $         27    $    17    $        90    $    23  \n  losses                                                        \n  Downwa\u2026                                                       \n  changes                                                       \n  for                   4          \u2014             24          \u2014  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n  Upward                                                        \n  changes                                                       \n  for                  17          7             49        141  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 22 for additional\ninformation on these\nnonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                    September 30, 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                          299  \n  Downward changes for                                      28  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       913  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

Citi uses various\nmetrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the\ntime of modification. Citi\u2019s significant consumer modification\nprograms are described below. Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist\ncredit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty\nby offering long-term loan modification programs. These\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan\nnot to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer\u2019s available\nline of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card\nborrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nseek to restructure customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In both\ncircumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nstandard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may\nforgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays\na required amount. Residential Mortgages Citi utilizes a third-\nparty subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage\nloans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to\nassist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing\nfinancial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate\nreductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term\nextensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in\nforbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the\nend of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently\nmodifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi\nenters into a trial modification with the borrower. Trial\nmodifications generally represent a three-monthperiod during\nwhich the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated\nmodified payment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue\ninterest in accordance with their original contractual terms.\nUpon successful completion of the trial period, and the\nborrower\u2019s formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the\nborrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the\nmajority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be\nenrolled in a permanent modification.

These\nSPEs are not consolidated.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 6billion and $ 69billion\nin unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 283million and $ 498million\nin maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\n                              160                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain investment funds\nfor which the Company provides investment management services\nand personal estate trusts for which the Company provides\nadministrative, trustee and/or investment management services; \u2022\ncertain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the\nCompany provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no\ndecision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some\nof which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-\nrelated commitment. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these\ntransactions was $ 13.8billion and $ 33.6billion, respectively\n(for more information on these positions, see Note 13 and Note\n27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the\nCompany holds securities in inventory, as these investments are\nmade on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and\nasset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and\n21 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              161                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets\ninclude those assets that can only be used to settle obligations\nof consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those obligations. In\naddition, the assets include third-party assets of consolidated\nVIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in\nconsolidation. The liabilities include third-party liabilities\nof consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that\neliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts\nwhere creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to\nthe general credit of Citigroup.\n

Citi did not transfer\nnon-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization\nentities during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022. These securities are backed by either residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of\nclients. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Citi\nheld noretained interests in private label re-securitization\ntransactions structured by Citi. The Company also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency)\nsecurities. During the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of\napproximately $ 4.3billion and $ 12.8billion, respectively, to\nre-securitization entities, compared to approximately $\n5.3billion and $ 20.3billion for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the\nfair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-\nsecuritization transactions structured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.4billion (including $ 552million related to\nre-securitization transactions executed in 2023), compared to $\n1.4billion as of December 31, 2022 (including $ 801million\nrelated to re-securitization transactions executed in 2022),\nwhich is recorded in Trading account assets . The original fair\nvalues of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi\nholds a retained interest as of September 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022 were approximately $ 85.9billion and $ 79.4billion,\nrespectively. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-\nsecuritization entities. Citi-Administered Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Conduits At September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had\napproximately $ 20.9billion and $ 19.6billion of purchased\nassets outstanding, respectively, and had unfunded commitments\nwith clients of approximately $ 15.6billion and $ 13.9billion,\nrespectively. Substantially all of the funding of the conduits\nis in the form of short-term commercial paper. At September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining\nmaturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were\napproximately 68and 64days, respectively. Each asset purchased\nby the conduit is structured with transaction-specific credit\nenhancement, including over-collateralization, cash and excess\nspread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party\nguarantees. Credit enhancement is sized with the objective of\napproximating an investment-grade credit rating, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancement, the conduits have obtained letters of credit\nfrom the Company that equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit\u2019s\nassets with a minimum of $ 200million to $ 350million. The\nletters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total\napproximately $ 1.9billion and $ 1.9billion as of September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The net result across\nmultiseller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the\nevent that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit\nare allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial\npaper investors. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Company owned $ 9.9billion and $ 8.6billion, respectively,\nof the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The\nCompany\u2019s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and\nthe Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the conduits. Municipal Securities\nTender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts At September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided\nby the Company. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nliquidity agreements provided with respect to customer TOB\ntrusts totaled $ 0.5billion and $ 1.1billion, respectively, of\nwhich $ 0.3billion and $ 0.7billion, respectively, were offset\nby reimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure related\nto TOB transactions, where the residual owned by the customer\nwas at least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the\ntransaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed. The\nCompany also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of\ncredit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which\nare not variable interest entities, and municipality-related\nissuers that totaled $ 1.3billion and $ 1.4billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These\nliquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by\nreimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.\n                              166                               \nAsset-Based Financing\n\nThe primary types of Citi\u2019s asset-based financings, total assets\nof the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss are presented below.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 23 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining\nto Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e.,\nmarket risk), counterparty\nfailure (i.e., credit risk)\nand/or periods of high\nvolatility or financial stress\n(i.e., liquidity risk), as\nwell as any market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              168                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022. Gross\npositive fair values are\noffset against gross negative\nfair values by counterparty,\npursuant to enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              169

      \nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives Certain\nderivative instruments contain provisions that require the\nCompany to either post additional collateral or immediately\nsettle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of\na specified event related to the credit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are defined by the existing derivative\ncontracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the\nCompany and its affiliates. The fair value (excluding CVA) of\nall derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net liability position at September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 15billion and $ 18billion,\nrespectively. The Company posted $ 13billion and $ 15billion as\ncollateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as\nof September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch\nby all threemajor rating agencies as of September 30, 2023, the\nCompany could be required to post an additional $ 0.7billion as\neither collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could be required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians collateral previously received from\nexisting derivative counterparties in the amount of $ 4million\nupon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral requirements of approximately $\n0.7billion. Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers\nFor transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the Company has retained substantially\nall of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), the\nasset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received\nas of the date of derecognition were $ 2.2billion and $\n1.4billion as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. At September 30, 2023, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets was $ 2.2billion. The fair value\nof the total return swaps as of September 30, 2023 was $\n3million recorded as gross derivative assets and $ 52million\nrecorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2022,\nthe fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $\n1.4billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $\n27million recorded as gross derivative assets and $ 32million\nrecorded as gross derivative liabilities.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For\nadditional information\nregarding fair value\nmeasurement at Citi, see Note\n25 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nsignificant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022\nLevel 3: Valuations derived\nfrom valuation techniques in\nwhich one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers are unobservable . As\nrequired under the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data-driven selection\ncriteria to determine whether\nan instrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022\nThe determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based upon the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nThe table below summarizes the\ncredit valuation

In other instances, market changes have\nresulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some\nunobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall\nvaluation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-\nin or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $\n1.3billion and $ 7.4billion of certain structured long-term debt\nproducts being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the\nperiod December 31, 2021 to September 30, 2022: \u2022 During the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2022, transfers of\nLong-term debt were $ 2.8billion and $ 9.6billion, respectively,\nfrom Level 2 to Level 3.

In other instances,\nmarket changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more\nobservable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less\nsignificant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g.,\nwhen an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money).

Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 18\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a gain\nof $ 395million and a gain of $ 1,159million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a\nloss of $( 875) million and a gain of $ 4,800million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nChanges in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-\nspecific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the\nCompany\u2019s current credit spreads observable in the bond market\ninto the relevant valuation technique used to value each\nliability as described above. The Fair Value Option for\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities Selected Portfolios\nof Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities\nBorrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase,\nSecurities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term\nBorrowings The Company elected the fair value option for certain\nportfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements\nto resell and fixed income securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain\nuncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-\ndealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and\nJapan. In each case, the election was made because the related\ninterest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily\nwith offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at\nfair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for\ntransactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal\ntransactions . The related interest revenue and interest expense\nare measured based on the contractual rates specified in the\ntransactions and are reported as Interest revenue and Interest\nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans\nand Other Credit Products Citigroup has also elected the fair\nvalue option for certain other originated and purchased loans,\nincluding certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and\nletters of credit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading\nbusinesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged\nfinancing commitments. Significant groups of transactions\ninclude loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be\neither sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions\nwhere the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments,\nsuch as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps\nwhere the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans\nto a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to\nmitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting\nis complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair\nvalue was not elected for most lending transactions across the\nCompany.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                Septem\u2026                                         \n                    30,                   December              \n                   2023                   31, 2022              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026       Trading       Loans        Trading       Loans  \n  of             assets                     assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $    4,340    $  7,411    $     6,011    $  5,360  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess            120          60            167          51  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans               \u2014           1              \u2014           2  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value               \u2014           1              \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              200                               \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 541million and $\n729million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended September 30,\n2023 and 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to\na loss of $( 27) million and $( 69) million, respectively.\nChanges in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are\nestimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads\nand recovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of\nits commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment\nis bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the contract within\nTrading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across\nunallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $\n0.4billion and $ 0.3billion at September 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, respectively. As part of its commodity trading\nactivities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments\nand executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative\ncontracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an\nunallocated precious metals investment, Citi\u2019s receivable from\nits depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its\ninvestment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward\npurchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed\nto unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative,\nat fair value through earnings. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-\nSale (HFS) Citigroup has elected the fair value option for\ncertain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming\nadjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are\nintended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged\nwith derivative instruments.

There was no net change in fair value\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk.

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n(2) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be approximately $\n137billion and $ 130billion, respectively. However, Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of the\nactual potential loss exposure based on its historical\nexperience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as\nmost products and services are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.\n                              203                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse In addition to the amounts presented in\nthe tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $\n11million and $ 10million at September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively, and these amounts are included in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s loans sold with recourse, see Note 27 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\nCredit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of its\ncredit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide insurance coverage for rental\ncars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased\nproducts, price protection for certain purchases and protection\nfor lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the\ntable, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe actual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value\nof Citi\u2019s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of September 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance\nIndemnification Citi has an indemnification contingency to\nBrighthouse Financial in connection with Citi\u2019s sale of an\ninsurance subsidiary. A liability under this indemnification\nagreement is currently remote because Brighthouse Financial\nwould become responsible for LTC policyholder claims only when\nboth the reinsurance provided by other parties ceases and trust\nassets set aside to meet these claims are not adequate. However,\nshould events occur causing both the reinsurance protection and\ntrust collateral to become insufficient to cover Brighthouse\nFinancial\u2019s LTC policyholder claims, Citi will be required to\neither estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range\nof loss to the extent that such an estimate can be made, or to\naccrue for such liability if the event becomes probable and\nestimable. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential\nexposure under this indemnification obligation. For additional\ninformation, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Futures and Over-the-\nCounter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on\ncentral clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi\nhas concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes\nin its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 21 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually\nagreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the\nclient all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions\non the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right\nas a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets,\n(iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client\nfor the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and\n(iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin\ncollected and remitted in this manner was\n                              204                               \napproximately $ 17.3billion\nand $ 18.0billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022,\nrespectively. Variation margin\ndue from clients to the\nrespective CCP, or from the\nCCP to clients, reflects\nchanges in the value of the\nclient\u2019s derivative contracts\nfor each trading day. As a\nclearing member, Citi is\nexposed to the risk of non-\nperformance by clients (e.g.,\nfailure of a client to post\nvariation margin to the CCP\nfor negative changes in the\nvalue of the client\u2019s\nderivative contracts). In the\nevent of non-performance by a\nclient, Citi would move to\nclose out the client\u2019s\npositions. The CCP would\ntypically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client\nand held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required\nto be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds\nincremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client,\nwhich would typically be\nexpected to be sufficient to\nmitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in\nthe event the client fails to\nperform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities\ncollateral posted by clients\nis not recognized on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFICC Sponsored Member Repo\nProgram Citi acts as a\nsponsoring member of the\nGovernment Securities Division\nof the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation (FICC) to clear\neligible resale and repurchase\nagreements on behalf of its\nclients that become sponsored\nmembers of the FICC. Citi, as\nsponsoring member, is required\nto provide a guarantee to the\nFICC with respect to the\nprompt payment and performance\nof its sponsored members.\nBecause Citi obtains a\nsecurity interest in the cash\nor high-quality securities\ncollateral that the clients\nplace with the clearing house,\nCiti expects the risk of loss\nfrom this guarantee to be\nremote. See Note 10 for\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s resale and repurchase\nagreements, including risk\nmitigation practices for these\ntransactions. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and\nIndemnifications At September\n30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the total carrying\namounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and\nindemnifications included in\nthe tables above amounted to\napproximately $ 1.2billion and\n$ 1.4billion, respectively.\nThe carrying value of\nfinancial and performance\nguarantees is included in\nOther liabilities . For loans\nsold with recourse, the\ncarrying value of the\nliability is included in Other\nliabilities . Collateral Cash\ncollateral available to Citi\nto reimburse losses realized\nunder these guarantees and\nindemnifications amounted to $\n49.8billion and $ 51.8billion\nat September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022,\nrespectively. Securities and\nother marketable assets held\nas collateral amounted to $\n76.3billion and $ 63.7billion\nat September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022,\nrespectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to\nreimburse losses realized\nunder securities lending\nindemnifications. In addition,\nletters of credit in favor of\nCiti held as collateral\namounted to $ 3.4billion and $\n3.7billion at September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.

LEASES\n\nThe Company\u2019s operating\nleases, where Citi is a\nlessee, include real estate,\nsuch as office space and\nbranches, and various types of\nequipment. These leases may\ncontain renewal and extension\noptions and early termination\nfeatures; however, these\noptions do not impact the\nlease term unless the Company\nis reasonably certain that it\nwill exercise options. These\nleases have a weighted-average\nremaining lease term of\napproximately six yearsas of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s leases, see\nNotes 1 and 28 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K.\nThe following table presents\ninformation on the right-of-\nuse (ROU) asset and lease\nliabilities included in\nPremises and equipment and\nOther liabilities ,\nrespectively:\n                                                                \n  In millions of              September 30,       December 31,  \n  dollars                              2023               2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  ROU asset                $          2,787    $         2,892  \n  Lease liability                     2,974              3,076  \n                                                                \nThe Company recognizes fixed\nlease costs on a straight-line\nbasis throughout the lease\nterm in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

For purposes\nof this Note, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory, or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. With\nrespect to previously incurred\nloss contingencies for which\nrecovery is expected, Citi\napplies loss recovery\naccounting when disputes and\nuncertainties affecting\nrecognition are resolved. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At September 30,\n2023, Citigroup estimates that\nthe reasonably possible\nunaccrued loss for these\nmatters ranges up to\napproximately $ 1.3billion in\nthe aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is\nable to estimate will change,\nand the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition,\nwhile many estimates presented\nin financial statements and\nother financial disclosures\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of\nreasonably possible loss\narising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued in\nrelation to matters for which\nan estimate has been made\ncould be substantially higher\nor lower than the range of\nloss included in the estimate.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters\ndescribed in this Note would\nnot be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters\ncould, from time to time, have\na material adverse effect on\nCitigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash\nflows in particular quarterly\nor annual periods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 29 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. FDIC Special Assessment\nOn May 11, 2023, the FDIC\nissued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking that would\nimplement a special\nassessment\u2014 primarily upon\nlarge banks\u2014to recover the\nuninsured deposit losses from\nthe failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank. The\nFDIC estimated that of the\ncost of the failures,\napproximately $15.8 billion\nwas attributable to the\nprotection of uninsured\ndepositors, an estimate that\nwill be periodically adjusted.\nThe FDIC has proposed\ncollecting the special\nassessment at an annual rate\nof approximately 12.5 basis\npoints of uninsured U.S.\ndeposits over eight quarterly\nassessment periods beginning\nin 2024. There is sufficient\nuncertainty around the final\nFDIC regulation that would\nimpact both the timing and\namount. If the final rule for\nthe FDIC special assessment,\nwhich is expected before the\nend of 2023, is enacted as\nproposed, Citi is likely to\nincur up to a $ 1.5billion\npretax charge, impacting\noperating expenses. This\namount is not included in the\nreasonably possible loss\nestimate above.
