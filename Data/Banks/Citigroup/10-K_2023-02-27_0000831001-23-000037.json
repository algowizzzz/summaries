this Executive\nSummary, Citi demonstrated\ncontinued progress across the\nfranchise during 2022:\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s revenues increased 5%\nversus the prior year,\nincluding net gains on sales\nof Citi\u2019s Philippines and\nThailand consumer banking\nbusinesses versus a loss on\nsale of Citi\u2019s Australia\nconsumer banking business in\nthe prior year. Excluding\nthese divestiture-related\nimpacts (see \u201c2022 Results\nSummary\u201d below), revenues\nincreased 3%, driven by higher\nnet interest income, partially\noffset by lower non-interest\nrevenues.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses increased 6%\nversus the prior year,\nincluding divestiture-related\nimpacts in both the current\nand prior years. Excluding\nthese divestiture-related\nimpacts (see \u201c2022 Results\nSummary\u201d below), expenses\nincreased 8%, driven by\ncontinued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation,\nbusiness-led investments and\nvolume-related expenses, as\nwell as other risk and control\ninvestments and inflation, all\npartially offset by\nproductivity savings, the\nimpact of foreign exchange\ntranslation and the expense\nreduction from the closure of\nfive exit markets (see also\n\u201cExpenses\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s cost of credit was\n$5.2 billion, versus $(3.8)\nbillion in the prior year,\nlargely reflecting a net build\nof $1.2 billion in the\nallowance for credit losses\n(ACL) for loans and unfunded\ncommitments, primarily due to\nconsumer loan growth and a\ndeterioration in macroeconomic\nassumptions, compared to a net\nACL release of $8.8 billion in\nthe prior year.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $7.3 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends and share\nrepurchases.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) Capital ratio increased\nto 13.0% as of December 31,\n2022, compared to 12.2% as of\nDecember 31, 2021 (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below).\nCiti\u2019s required regulatory\nCET1 Capital ratio was 12.0%\nas of January 1, 2023, under\nthe Basel III Standardized\nApproach.\n\n\u2022 Citi made substantial\nprogress on its consumer\nbanking business divestitures\nin 2022, closing sales in five\nexit markets and working\ntoward closing four additional\nsale transactions, as well as\nprogressing with the ongoing\nwind-downs of the Korea\nconsumer banking business and\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbusinesses.\n                                                                \n  2022 Results Summary                                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $14.8 billion, or $7.00 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $22.0 billion, or $10.14\nper share in the prior year.\nThe decrease in net income was\nprimarily driven by the higher\ncost of credit, resulting from\nloan growth in Personal\nBanking and Wealth Management\n(PBWM) and a deterioration in\nmacroeconomic assumptions,\n\nand the higher operating\nexpenses, partially offset by\nthe higher revenues.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nwas 19.4% in the current year\nversus 19.8% in the prior\nyear. Earnings per share (EPS)\ndecreased 31%, reflecting the\ndecrease in net income,\npartially offset by a 4%\ndecline in average diluted\nshares outstanding.\n\nAs discussed above, results\nfor 2022 included divestiture-\nrelated impacts of\napproximately $(184) million\nin after-tax earnings,\nsubstantially all of which\nwere recorded in Legacy\nFranchises (for additional\ninformation, see discussion\nbelow). Collectively,\ndivestiture-related impacts\nhad a $0.09 negative impact on\nEPS. This compares to\ndivestiture-related negative\nimpacts on EPS of $0.80 in\n2021.

Excluding the\ndivestiture-related impacts,\nrevenues were up 3%, as the\nimpact of higher interest\nrates across businesses and\nstrong loan growth in PBWM\nwere partially offset by\ndeclines in Banking in\nInstitutional Clients\n                               3                                \nGroup (ICG) and Asia\ninvestment product revenue in\nGlobal Wealth Management\n(Global Wealth), as well as\nthe reduction in revenues from\nthe closure of five exit\nmarkets and ongoing wind-\ndowns.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $657 billion, down\n2% versus the prior year,\nlargely driven by Legacy\nFranchises and the impact of\nforeign exchange translation.\nThe decline in Legacy\nFranchises primarily reflected\nthe reclassification of loans\nto Other assets to reflect\nheld-for-sale (HFS)\naccounting, as a result of the\nsigning of sale agreements for\nconsumer banking businesses in\nAsia Consumer Banking (Asia\nConsumer), as well as the\nimpact of the ongoing Korea\nand Russia wind-downs.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were $1.4 trillion,\nup 4% versus the prior year,\nlargely driven by Treasury and\ntrade solutions in ICG ,\npartially offset by the impact\nof foreign exchange\ntranslation.\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s operating expenses\nof $51.3 billion increased 6%\nin 2022. Reported expenses\nincluded divestiture-related\nimpacts of approximately $696\nmillion in the current year\nand approximately $1.2 billion\nin the prior year,\nsubstantially all of which\nwere recorded in Legacy\nFranchises . Excluding these\ndivestiture-related impacts,\nexpenses increased 8% versus\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby the following:\n\n\u2022 Approximately 2% by\ntransformation investments,\nwith about two-thirds related\nto the risk, controls, data\nand finance programs\n(approximately 25% of the\nprogram investments were\nrelated to technology).\n\n\u2022 Approximately 1% by\nbusiness-led investments, as\nCiti continues to hire\ncommercial and investment\nbankers, as well as client\nadvisors in Global Wealth, and\ncontinues to invest in client\nexperience, front-office\nplatforms and onboarding.\n\n\u2022 Approximately 1% by higher\nvolume-related expenses across\nboth PBWM and ICG .\n\n\u2022 Approximately 3% by other\nrisk and control investments\nand inflation, partially\noffset by a Revlon-related\nwire transfer recovery,\nproductivity savings, the\nimpact of foreign exchange\ntranslation and the expense\nreduction from the exit\nmarkets.\n\nCiti expects to incur higher\nexpenses in 2023, primarily\ndriven by transformation-\nrelated investments, volume-\nrelated expenses and\ninflation-related impacts.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $5.2\nbillion, compared to a benefit\nof $3.8 billion in the prior\nyear. Results in 2022 included\nnet credit losses of $3.8\nbillion versus $4.9 billion in\nthe prior year. The higher\ncost of credit was driven by\nthe net build of $1.2 billion\nin the ACL for loans and\nunfunded commitments, compared\nto a net ACL release of $8.8\nbillion in the prior year,\npartially offset by the lower\nnet credit losses. The net ACL\nbuild was primarily due to\ncards loan growth in PBWM and\na deterioration in\nmacroeconomic assumptions. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting\n\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Citi\u2019s Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $3.8\nbillion decreased 23% from the\nprior year, largely driven by\nlower consumer net credit\nlosses. Consumer net credit\nlosses decreased 20% to $3.6\nbillion, reflecting low loss\nrates in the first half of\n2022, followed by the ongoing\nnormalization of losses toward\npre-pandemic levels,\nparticularly in Retail\nservices cards business in\nPBWM . Corporate net credit\nlosses decreased 54% to $178\nmillion, largely driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality.\n\nCiti expects to incur higher\nnet credit losses in 2023,\nprimarily driven by continued\nnormalization toward pre-\npandemic levels, particularly\nin the cards business in PBWM\n.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 13.0% as of December\n\n31, 2022, compared to 12.2% as\nof December 31, 2021, based\n\non the Basel III Standardized\nApproach for determining risk-\nweighted assets (RWA). The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby net income, impacts from\nthe closing of the Australia,\nPhilippines and other Asia\nconsumer banking business\nsales and business actions to\nreduce RWA, partially offset\nby the return of capital to\ncommon shareholders and\ninterest rate impacts on\nCitigroup\u2019s investment\nportfolio. The increase in\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio was\nalso partially offset by the\nimpact of adopting the\nStandardized Approach for\nCounterparty Credit Risk (SA-\nCCR) on January 1, 2022.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of December\n31, 2022 was 5.8%, compared to\n5.7% as of December 31, 2021.\nThe increase was driven by a\ndecrease in Total Leverage\nExposure, partly offset by\nlower Tier 1 Capital. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s capital ratios and\nrelated components, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below.\n\nCiti has continued to pause\ncommon share repurchases in\norder to absorb any temporary\ncapital impacts related to any\npotential signing of a sale\nagreement for its Mexico\nConsumer and Small Business\nand Middle-Market Banking\n(Mexico Consumer/SBMM)\nbusiness (for additional\ninformation, see\n\u201cMacroeconomic and Other Risks\nand Uncertainties\u201d and the\ncapital return risk factor in\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d below) and to\ncontinue to have ample capital\nto serve its clients.\n                                                                \n  Institutional Clients Group                                   \n                                                                \nICG net income of $10.7\nbillion decreased 25%, driven\nby a net ACL release in the\nprior year, versus a net ACL\nbuild in the current year, and\nhigher expenses, partially\noffset by higher revenues. ICG\noperating expenses of $26.3\nbillion increased 10%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and volume-related\nexpenses, partially offset by\na Revlon-related wire transfer\nrecovery, the impact of\nforeign exchange translation\nand productivity savings.\n\nICG revenues of $41.2 billion\nincreased 3% (including losses\non loan hedges), as revenue\ngrowth in Services and Markets\nwas partially offset by lower\nrevenues in Banking. Results\nincluded a gain on loan hedges\nof $307 million,\n                               4                                \ncompared with a loss on loan\nhedges of $140 million in the\nprior year.\n\nServices revenues of $16.0\nbillion increased 27%.\nTreasury and trade solutions\n(TTS) revenues of $12.2\nbillion increased 32%, driven\nby 46% growth in net interest\nincome and 10% growth in non-\ninterest revenue. The strong\nperformance in TTS was driven\nby the benefit of higher\ninterest rates, as well as\nbusiness actions, including\nbalance sheet optimization and\nmanaging deposit pricing,\ndeepening of relationships\nwith existing clients and an\nincrease in new clients across\nsegments. Securities services\nrevenues of $3.9 billion\nincreased 15%, as net interest\nincome increased 59%, driven\nby higher interest rates\nacross currencies, as well as\nthe impact of foreign exchange\ntranslation, partially offset\nby a 1% decrease in non-\ninterest revenue due to the\nimpact of lower global\nfinancial markets.\n\nMarkets revenues of $19.1\nbillion increased 7% versus\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby Fixed income markets,\npartially offset by lower\nclient activity levels in\nEquity markets, as well as\nbusiness actions to reduce\nRWA. Fixed income markets\nrevenues of $14.6 billion\nincreased 13%, driven by\nstrength in rates and\ncurrencies. Equity markets\nrevenues of $4.6 billion were\ndown 9%, largely reflecting\nreduced client activity in\nequity derivatives versus the\nprior year.\n\nBanking revenues of $6.1\nbillion decreased 35%,\nincluding the gain on loan\nhedges in the current year and\nloss on loan hedges in the\nprior year. Excluding the gain\nand loss on loan hedges,\nBanking revenues of $5.8\nbillion decreased 39%, driven\nby lower revenues in\nInvestment banking and\nCorporate lending. Investment\nbanking revenues of $3.1\nbillion decreased 53%, as\nheightened macroeconomic\nuncertainty and volatility\ncontinued to impact client\nactivity. Excluding the gain\nand loss on loan hedges,\nCorporate lending revenues\ndecreased 8% versus the prior\nyear, driven by the impact of\nforeign currency translation,\nhigher cost of funds and\nhigher hedging costs.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nICG in 2022, see \u201c\nInstitutional Clients Group \u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  Personal Banking and Wealth Management                        \n                                                                \nPBWM net income of $3.3\nbillion decreased 57% versus\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby a net ACL release in the\nprior year versus a net ACL\nbuild in the current year, as\nwell as higher expenses. PBWM\noperating expenses of $16.3\nbillion increased 11%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, other risk and\ncontrol initiatives, volume-\nrelated expenses and business-\nled investments, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nPBWM revenues of $24.2 billion\nincreased 4% versus the prior\nyear, as net interest income\ngrowth, driven by strong loan\ngrowth across Branded cards\nand Retail services and higher\ninterest rates, was partially\noffset by a decline in non-\ninterest revenue, driven by\nlower investment product\nrevenue in Global Wealth and\nhigher partner payments in\nRetail services.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nof $16.8 billion increased 7%\nversus the prior year. Branded\ncards revenues of $8.9 billion\nincreased 9%, driven by higher\nnet interest income. In\nBranded cards, new account\nacquisitions increased 11%,\ncard spend volumes increased\n16% and average loans\nincreased 11%. Retail services\nrevenues of $5.5 billion\nincreased 7%,\n\ndriven by higher net interest\nincome, partially offset by\nhigher partner payments.\nRetail banking revenues of\n$2.5 billion were largely\nunchanged versus the prior\nyear, as higher interest\nincome and modest deposit\ngrowth were offset by lower\nmortgage revenues due to fewer\nmortgage originations.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues of $7.4\nbillion decreased 2% versus\nthe prior year, as investment\nproduct revenue headwinds,\nparticularly in Asia, more\nthan offset net interest\nincome growth from higher\ninterest rates and higher loan\nand deposit volumes.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nPBWM in 2022, see \u201c Personal\nBanking and Wealth Management\n\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Legacy Franchises                                             \n                                                                \nLegacy Franchises net loss of\n$12 million compared to net\nincome of $1 million in the\nprior year, primarily driven\nby higher cost of credit,\npartially offset by lower\nexpenses and higher revenues,\nprimarily reflecting the\nPhilippines and Thailand gains\non sales in the current year\nand the Australia loss on sale\nin the prior year. Legacy\nFranchises expenses of $7.8\nbillion decreased 6%, largely\ndriven by the absence of the\nKorea VERP charge in the prior\nyear and the benefit from\nclosing the five exit markets,\npartially offset by the $535\nmillion goodwill impairment,\nan approximate $70 million\nimpairment of long-lived\nassets related to the Russia\nconsumer banking business and\n$156 million of other\naggregate divestiture-related\ncosts.\n\nLegacy Franchises revenues of\n$8.5 billion increased 3%\nversus the prior year,\nprimarily driven by the\nPhilippines and Thailand gains\non sale versus the Australia\nloss on sale in the prior\nyear. Excluding these\ndivestiture-related impacts,\nrevenues decreased 15%,\nprimarily driven by the\nreduction in revenues from the\nclosings of the five exit\nmarkets, as well as the impact\nof the ongoing Korea and\nRussia wind-downs.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nLegacy Franchises in 2022, see\n\u201c Legacy Franchises \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Corporate/Other                                               \n                                                                \nCorporate/Other net income was\n$879 million, compared to a\nnet loss of $8 million in the\nprior year, reflecting higher\nrevenue and lower expenses,\npartially offset by lower\nincome tax benefits, as well\nas the second quarter of 2022\nrelease of a CTA (cumulative\ntranslation adjustment) loss\n(net of hedges) from\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) related to the\nsubstantial liquidation of a\nlegacy U.K. consumer\noperation, recorded in\ndiscontinued operations.\nCorporate/Other operating\nexpenses of $953 million\ndecreased 31%, primarily\ndriven by lower consulting\nexpenses and the impact of\ncertain legal settlements.\n\nCorporate/Other revenues of\n$1.4 billion increased from\n$0.5 billion in the prior\nyear, driven by higher net\ninterest income, primarily\nfrom the investment portfolio,\npartially offset by lower non-\ninterest revenue, primarily\ndue to the absence of mark-to-\nmarket gains in the prior year\nas well as higher hedging\ncosts.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nCorporate/Other in 2022, see \u201c\nCorporate/Other \u201d below.\n                               5                                \n                                                                \n  Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties               \n                                                                \nVarious geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties continue to\nadversely impact economic\nconditions in the U.S. and\nglobally. The U.S. and other\ncountries have continued to\nexperience significantly\nelevated levels of inflation,\nresulting in central banks\nimplementing a series of\ninterest rates increases, with\nadditional increases expected\nin the near term. In addition\nto causing a humanitarian\ncrisis, the war in Ukraine\ncontinues to disrupt energy\nand food markets. An economic\nrebound in China remains\nuncertain, due to the ongoing\nimpacts from COVID-19, the\namount of leverage in its\neconomy and stress in the\nproperty sector. These and\nother factors have adversely\naffected financial markets,\nnegatively impacted global\neconomic growth rates,\ncontributed to lower consumer\nconfidence and increased the\nrisk of recession in Europe,\nthe U.S. and other countries.\nThese and other factors could\nadversely affect Citi\u2019s\ncustomers, clients,\nbusinesses, funding costs,\nexpenses and results during\n2023.\n\nIn addition, Citi could incur\na significant loss on sale in\n2023, due to CTA losses (net\nof hedges) in AOCI , goodwill\nwrite-offs and other AOCI loss\ncomponents, related to the\npotential signing of a sale\nagreement for any of its\nremaining consumer banking\ndivestitures. The majority of\nthese losses would be\nregulatory capital neutral at\nclosing.\n\nFor a further discussion of\ntrends, uncertainties and\nrisks that will or could\nimpact Citi\u2019s businesses,\nresults of operations, capital\nand other financial condition\nduring 2023, see \u201c2022 Results\nSummary\u201d above and \u201cRisk\nFactors,\u201d each respective\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations and \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk,\u201d including\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia,\u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  CITI\u2019S CONSENT ORDER COMPLIANCE                               \n                                                                \nCiti has embarked on a\nmultiyear transformation, with\nthe target outcome to change\nCiti\u2019s business and operating\nmodels such that they\nsimultaneously strengthen risk\nand controls and improve\nCiti\u2019s value to customers,\nclients and shareholders.\n\nThis includes efforts to\neffectively implement the\nOctober 2020 Federal Reserve\nBoard (FRB) and Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency\n(OCC) consent orders issued to\nCitigroup and Citibank,\nrespectively. In the second\nquarter of 2021, Citi made an\ninitial submission to the OCC,\nand submitted its plans to\naddress the consent orders to\nboth regulators during the\nthird quarter of 2021. Citi\ncontinues to work\nconstructively with the\nregulators and provides to\nboth regulators on an ongoing\nbasis additional information\nregarding its plans and\nprogress. Citi will continue\nto reflect their feedback in\nits project plans and\nexecution efforts.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\nefforts include continued\ninvestments in its\ntransformation, including the\nremediation of its consent\norders. Citi\u2019s CEO has made\nthe strengthening of Citi\u2019s\nrisk and control environment a\nstrategic priority and has\nestablished a Chief\nAdministrative Officer\norganization to centralize\nprogram management. In\naddition, the Citigroup and\nCitibank Boards of Directors\neach formed a Transformation\nOversight Committee, an ad hoc\ncommittee of each Board, to\nprovide oversight of\nmanagement\u2019s remediation\nefforts under the consent\norders.

Citigroup allocates\nstockholders\u2019 equity and long-term debt to its businesses\nthrough intersegment allocations as shown above.\n\n(4) Represents the attribution of Citigroup\u2019s liquid assets\n(primarily consisting of cash, marketable equity securities and\navailable-for-sale debt securities) to the various businesses\nbased on Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR) assumptions.\n\n(5) Corporate/Other equity represents noncontrolling interests.\n                               11                               \n                                                                \n  INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS GROUP                                   \n                                                                \nInstitutional Clients Group (ICG) includes Services, Markets and\nBanking (for additional information on these businesses, see\n\u201cCitigroup Operating Segments\u201d above). ICG provides corporate,\ninstitutional and public sector clients around the world with a\nfull range of wholesale banking products and services, including\nfixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange,\nprime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income\nresearch, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory\nservices, cash management, trade finance and securities\nservices. ICG transacts with clients in both cash instruments\nand derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency,\nequity and commodity products.\n\nICG \u2019s revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads\nassociated with these activities. ICG earns fee income for\nassisting clients with transactional services and clearing and\nproviding brokerage and investment banking services and other\nsuch activities. Such fees are recognized at the point in time\nwhen Citigroup\u2019s performance under the terms of a contractual\narrangement is completed, which is typically at the\ntrade/execution date or closing of a transaction. Revenue\ngenerated from these activities is recorded in Commissions and\nfees and Investment banking fees . Revenue is also generated\nfrom assets under custody and administration, which is\nrecognized as/when the associated promised service is satisfied,\nwhich normally occurs at the point in time the service is\nrequested by the customer and provided by Citi. Revenue\ngenerated from these activities is primarily recorded in\nAdministration and other fiduciary fees . For additional\ninformation on these various types of revenues, see Note 5.\n\nIn addition, as a market maker, ICG facilitates transactions,\nincluding holding product inventory to meet client demand, and\nearns the differential between the price at which it buys and\nsells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized\ngains and losses on the inventory are recorded in Principal\ntransactions . Mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit\nderivatives (used to economically hedge the corporate loan\nportfolio) are also recorded in Principal transactions (for\nadditional information on Principal transactions revenue, see\nNote 6). Other primarily includes realized gains and losses on\navailable-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on\nequity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-\nrecurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets\nheld, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured\nfunding transactions and customers deposits, is recorded as Net\ninterest income.\n\nThe amount and types of Markets revenues are impacted by a\nvariety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity;\nchanges in market variables such as interest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor\nconfidence and other macroeconomic conditions. Assuming all\nother market conditions do not change, increases in client\nactivity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in\nincreases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can\nsignificantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads\nand the fair value of product inventory. For example, a decrease\nin market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease\nclient activity levels and widen credit spreads on product\ninventory positions. ICG \u2019s management of the Markets businesses\ninvolves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors at\nthe trading desk as well as the country level.\n\nIn the Markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues\ndirectly attributable to client transactions at the time of\ninception, including commissions, interest or fees earned.\nClient revenues do not include the results of client\nfacilitation activities (e.g., holding product inventory in\nanticipation of client demand) or the results of certain\neconomic hedging activities.\n\nICG \u2019s international presence is supported by trading floors in\napproximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95\ncountries and jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, Citi\nintends to end nearly all of the institutional banking services\nit offers in Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023.\nGoing forward, Citi\u2019s only operations in Russia will be those\nnecessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory\nobligations. At this time, the estimated cost to be incurred in\nrelation to this action is approximately $80 million (excluding\nthe impact from any portfolio sales), primarily through 2024.\nFor additional information about Citi\u2019s continued efforts to\nreduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see \u201c Legacy\nFranchises \u201d and \u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d below.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, ICG had $1.7 trillion in assets and $845\nbillion in deposits. Securities services managed $22.2 trillion\nin assets under custody and administration at December 31, 2022,\nof which Citi provided both custody and administrative services\nto certain clients related to $1.9 trillion of such assets.\nManaged assets under trust were $4.0 trillion at December 31,\n2022.

interest income may be\nrisk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a\ndescription of the composition of these revenue line items, see\nNotes 4, 5 and 6.\n\n(2) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion\nof the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans\nand loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on loan hedges include the\nmark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market\non the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. The fixed\npremium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate\nlending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection.\nCitigroup\u2019s results of operations excluding the impact of gain\n(loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n                               14                               \nThe discussion of the results of operations for ICG below\nexcludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges\nof accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures.

Markets revenues\nwere up 7%, primarily driven\nby higher Fixed income markets\nrevenues, partially offset by\nlower Equity markets revenues\nand the impact of business\nactions taken to reduce RWA.\n\nBanking revenues were down 35%\n(39% excluding the impact of\ngain (loss) on loan hedges),\nreflecting lower revenues in\nboth Investment banking and\nCorporate lending.\n\nCiti expects that revenues in\nits Markets and Investment\nbanking businesses will\ncontinue to reflect the\noverall market environment\nduring 2023.\n\nWithin Services:\n\n\u2022 TTS revenues increased 32%,\ndriven by 46% growth in net\ninterest income and 10% growth\nin non-interest revenue,\ndriven by deepening of\nexisting client relations and\ngaining new clients across\nsegments. The increase in net\ninterest income was driven by\nboth the cash and trade\nbusinesses, reflecting\nbenefits from higher interest\nrates, balance sheet\noptimization, higher average\ndeposits and higher average\nloans. Average deposits grew\n1%, as volume growth was\npartially offset by the impact\nof foreign exchange\ntranslation. Average loans\ngrew 11%, primarily driven by\nthe strength in trade flows in\nAsia and Latin America,\npartially offset by loan sales\nin North America. Strong non-\ninterest revenues growth\nacross both cash and trade\nbusinesses reflected client\nengagement and growth from\nunderlying drivers, including\nhigher U.S. dollar clearing\nvolumes (up 2%), cross-border\nflows (up 11%) and commercial\ncard spend (up 49%).\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 15%, primarily\ndriven by an increase in net\ninterest income, reflecting\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies as well as the\nimpact of foreign exchange\ntranslation. Non-interest\nrevenues decreased 1%, due to\nthe impact of foreign exchange\ntranslation and lower fees in\nthe custody business tied to\nlower assets under custody and\nadministration (decline of\n7%), driven by declines in\nglobal financial markets. The\ndecline in non-interest\nrevenues was partially offset\nby continued elevated levels\nof corporate activity in\nissuer services and new client\nonboarding of $1.2 trillion in\nassets under custody and\nadministration. Average\ndeposits declined 7%, due to\nclients seeking higher rate\nalternatives.\n\nWithin Markets:\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 13%, driven\nby growth in rates and\ncurrencies across all regions,\ndue to strong corporate and\ninvestor client engagement,\npartially\n\noffset by a decline in spread\nproducts, primarily driven by\nNorth America.\n\n\u2022 Rates and currencies\nrevenues increased 34%,\nreflecting increased market\nvolatility, driven by rising\ninterest rates and\nquantitative tightening, as\ncentral banks responded to\nelevated levels of inflation.\nSpread products and other\nfixed income revenues\ndecreased 31%, due to\ncontinued lower client\nactivity across spread\nproducts and a challenging\ncredit market due to widening\nspreads for most of the year.\nThe decline in spread products\nand other fixed income\nrevenues was partially offset\nby strength in commodities,\nparticularly with corporate\nclients, as the business\nassisted those clients in\nmanaging risk associated with\nthe increased volatility.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\ndecreased 9%, driven by equity\nderivatives, primarily\nreflecting lower activity by\nboth corporate and\ninstitutional clients compared\nto a strong prior year. The\nlower revenues also reflected\na decline in equity cash,\ndriven by lower client\nactivity.\n\nWithin Banking:\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nwere down 53%, reflecting a\nsignificant decline in the\noverall market wallet and loss\nin wallet share, as heightened\nmacroeconomic uncertainty and\nvolatility continued to impact\nclient activity. Advisory\nrevenues decreased 24%,\nreflecting a decline in North\nAmerica and EMEA, driven by\nthe decline in the market\nwallet as well as loss in\nwallet share. Equity and debt\nunderwriting revenues\ndecreased 73% and 56%\nrespectively, reflecting a\ndecline in North America, EMEA\nand Asia and driven by the\ndecline in the market wallet\nas well as wallet share loss.\nThe decline in debt\nunderwriting revenues also\nreflected markdowns on loan\ncommitments and losses on loan\nsales.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nincreased 8%, including the\nimpact of gain (loss) on loan\nhedges. Excluding the impact\nof gain (loss) on loan hedges,\nrevenues decreased 8%,\nprimarily driven by the\nimpacts of foreign currency\ntranslation, higher cost of\nfunds and higher hedging\ncosts.\n\nExpenses were up 10%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and volume-related\nexpenses, partially offset by\na Revlon-related wire transfer\nrecovery, the impact of\nforeign exchange translation\nand productivity savings.\n\nProvisions were $911 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $2.5\nbillion in the prior year,\ndriven by an ACL build,\npartially offset by lower net\ncredit losses.\n\nNet credit losses declined to\n$152 million, compared to $356\nmillion in the prior year,\ndriven by improvements in\nportfolio credit quality.\n\nThe ACL build was $759\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $2.8 billion in the prior\nyear. The ACL build was\nprimarily driven by a\ndeterioration in macroeconomic\nassumptions.

$3.3 billion,\ncompared to $7.7 billion in\nthe prior year, reflecting\nsignificantly higher cost of\ncredit and higher expenses,\npartially offset by higher\nrevenues.\n\nRevenues increased 4%,\nprimarily due to higher net\ninterest income, driven by\nstrong loan growth in Branded\ncards and Retail services and\nhigher interest rates. The\nincrease was partially offset\nby lower non-interest revenue,\nreflecting lower investment\nproduct revenue in Global\nWealth and higher partner\npayments in Retail services\nresulting from higher\nrevenues.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nincreased 7%, reflecting\nhigher revenues in cards.\n\nCards revenues increased 8%.\nBranded cards revenues\nincreased 9%, primarily driven\nby higher net interest income\non higher loan balances.\nBranded cards new account\nacquisitions increased 11% and\ncard spend volume increased\n16%. Average loans increased\n11%, reflecting the higher\ncard spend volumes.\n\nRetail services revenues\nincreased 7%, primarily driven\nby higher net interest income\non higher loan balances and\nlower payment rates, partially\noffset by the increase in\npartner payments. The increase\nin partner payments reflected\nhigher income sharing as a\nresult of higher revenues (for\nadditional information on\npartner payments, see Note 5).\nRetail services credit card\nspend volume increased 8% and\naverage loans increased 6%,\nreflecting the higher card\nspend volumes.\n\nRetail banking revenues were\nlargely unchanged, as the\nhigher interest rates and\nmodest deposit growth were\noffset by lower mortgage\nrevenues due to fewer mortgage\noriginations, driven by the\nhigher interest rates. Average\ndeposits increased 3%, largely\nreflecting higher levels of\nconsumer liquidity in the\nfirst half of 2022.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues\ndecreased 2%, reflecting\ninvestment product revenue\nheadwinds, particularly in\nAsia, driven by overall market\nvolatility, partially offset\nby net interest income growth,\ndriven by higher interest\nrates and higher loan and\ndeposit volumes. Average loans\nincreased 2% and average\ndeposits increased 5%. Client\nassets decreased 8%, primarily\ndriven by declines in equity\nmarket valuations. Global\nWealth advisors increased 4%\nduring 2022. Private bank\nrevenues decreased 6%,\nCitigold revenues decreased 1%\nand Wealth at Work revenues\nincreased 6%.\n\nExpenses increased 11%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, other risk and\ncontrol initiatives, volume-\nrelated expenses and business-\nled investments, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions were $3.8 billion,\ncompared to a benefit of $1.2\nbillion in the prior year,\nlargely driven by a net ACL\nbuild. Net credit losses\ndecreased 1%, driven by\nhistorically low loss rates\nexperienced in the first half\nof 2022, followed by the\nongoing normalization of\nlosses toward pre-pandemic\nlevels, particularly in Retail\nservices (net credit losses up\n7% to $1.3 billion). Branded\ncards net credit losses\ndeclined 17% to $1.4 billion.\n\nThe net ACL build was $0.7\nbillion, compared to a net\nrelease of $4.3 billion in the\nprior year, primarily driven\nby U.S. Cards loan growth and\na deterioration in\nmacroeconomic assumptions.

Asia Consumer\nprovides traditional retail banking and branded card products to\nretail and small business customers. Mexico Consumer/SBMM\nprovides traditional retail banking and branded card products to\nconsumers and small business customers and traditional middle-\nmarket banking products and services to commercial customers\nthrough Citibanamex.\n\nLegacy Franchises also included the following consumer banking\nbusinesses prior to their sale: Australia, until its closing on\nJune 1, 2022; the Philippines, until its closing on August 1,\n2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings on November 1,\n2022; and Bahrain, until its closing on December 1, 2022. In\naddition, Citi has entered into agreements to sell its consumer\nbanking businesses in India, Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam, and\nannounced its wind-down of consumer banking operations in Korea\nand China and consumer banking and local commercial banking\noperations in Russia (see below). In December 2022, Citi\nannounced the pursuit of sales of portfolios within its China\nconsumer banking business, subject to applicable regulations.\nSee Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises \u2019\nconsumer banking business sales and wind-downs.\n\nAs previously disclosed, Citi announced the wind-down of its\nconsumer banking and local commercial banking operations in\nRussia, including its active pursuit of sales of certain Russia\nconsumer banking portfolios. In connection with this wind-down\nplan, Citi expects to incur approximately $110 million in costs\n(excluding the impact from any portfolio sales), primarily\nthrough 2024, largely driven by restructuring, vendor\ntermination fees and other related charges. In December 2022,\nCiti (i) sold a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal\ninstallment loans, totaling approximately $240 million in\noutstanding loan balances as of the fourth quarter of 2022 and\n(ii) entered into a referral agreement to settle a portfolio of\nruble-denominated credit card loans, subject to customer\nconsents; the outstanding card loans balance was approximately\n$219 million as of the fourth quarter of 2022. For additional\ninformation about Citi\u2019s continued efforts to reduce its\noperations and exposure in Russia, see \u201c Institutional Clients\nGroup \u201d above and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d below.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises had\n1,438 retail branches, $23 billion in retail banking loans and\n$51 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $8\nbillion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had\n$7 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances. These amounts\nexclude approximately $12 billion of loans ($9 billion of retail\nbanking loans and $3 billion of credit card loan balances) and\napproximately $16 billion of deposits, all of which were\nreclassified to Other assets and Other liabilities held-for-sale\n(HFS) as a result of Citi\u2019s agreements to sell its consumer\nbanking businesses in India, Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam.

million\n(approximately $(180) million\nafter-tax), which primarily\nconsisted of (i) an\napproximate $618 million\nPhilippines gain on sale\nrecorded in revenues, (ii) an\napproximate $209

expenses\nand (iii) contract\nmodification costs related to\nthe Asia divestitures of\napproximately $119 million\nrecorded in expenses.\n\nRevenues increased 3%,\nprimarily driven by higher\nrevenues in Asia Consumer and\nMexico Consumer/SBMM,\npartially offset by lower\nLegacy Holdings Assets\nrevenues.\n\nAsia Consumer revenues\nincreased 12%, primarily\ndriven by the Philippines and\nThailand gains on sale, versus\nthe Australia loss on sale in\nthe prior year, partially\noffset by the loss of revenues\nfrom the closing of the five\nexit markets and impacts of\nthe ongoing Korea and Russia\nwind-downs.\n\nMexico Consumer/SBMM revenues\nincreased 2%, as cards\nrevenues in Mexico Consumer\nincreased 7% and SBMM revenues\nincreased 9%, primarily due to\nhigher interest rates and\nhigher deposit and loan\ngrowth. The increase in\nrevenues was partially offset\nby a 1% decrease in retail\nbanking revenues, primarily\ndriven by lower fiduciary fees\nreflecting declines in equity\nmarket valuations.\n\nLegacy Holdings Assets\nrevenues of $(90) million\ndecreased from $195 million in\nthe prior year, largely driven\nby a CTA loss (net of hedges)\nrecorded in AOCI in the second\nquarter of 2022, related to\nthe substantial liquidation of\na legacy U.K. consumer\noperation (for additional\ninformation, see \u201c\nCorporate/Other \u201d below and\nNote 2), as well as the\ncontinued wind-down of Legacy\nHoldings Assets.\n\nExpenses decreased 6%,\nprimarily driven by the\nabsence of the $1.2 billion\ndivestiture-related costs in\nthe prior year, including the\nKorea VERP of approximately\n$1.1 billion and contract\nmodification costs related to\nAsia divestiture markets of\napproximately $119 million,\nand the benefit from the\nclosing of the five exit\nmarkets. The decline was\npartially offset by an\napproximate $535 million\ngoodwill impairment in the\nfirst quarter of 2022, an\napproximate $70 million\nimpairment of long-lived\nassets related to the Russia\nconsumer banking business in\nthe second quarter of 2022 and\napproximately $156 million of\nother aggregate divestiture-\nrelated costs.\n\nProvisions were $571 million,\ncompared to a benefit of $62\nmillion in the prior year,\nprimarily driven by a lower\nnet ACL release, partially\noffset by lower net credit\nlosses. Net credit losses\ndecreased 58%, primarily\nreflecting improved\ndelinquencies in both Asia\nConsumer and Mexico Consumer\nand the reclassification of\nloans and net credit losses to\nreflect HFS accounting as a\nresult of the signing of sale\nagreements for the\naforementioned consumer\nbanking businesses in Asia\nConsumer.\n\nThe net ACL release was $136\nmillion, compared to a net\nrelease of $1.6 billion in the\nprior year.

For additional\ninformation on capital-related\ntrends, uncertainties and\nrisks related to Citi\u2019s exit\nbusinesses, including the\nimpact of CTA losses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d above and\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  Capital Management                                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s capital management\nframework is designed to\nensure that Citigroup and its\nprincipal subsidiaries\nmaintain sufficient capital\nconsistent with each entity\u2019s\nrespective risk profile,\nmanagement targets and all\napplicable regulatory\nstandards and guidelines. Citi\nassesses its capital adequacy\nagainst a series of internal\nquantitative capital goals,\ndesigned to evaluate its\ncapital levels in expected and\nstressed economic\nenvironments. Underlying these\ninternal quantitative capital\ngoals are strategic capital\nconsiderations, centered on\npreserving and building\nfinancial strength.\n\nThe Citigroup Capital\nCommittee, with oversight from\nthe Risk Management Committee\nof Citigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors, has responsibility\nfor Citi\u2019s aggregate capital\nstructure, including the\ncapital assessment and\nplanning process, which is\nintegrated into Citi\u2019s capital\nplan. Balance sheet\nmanagement, including\noversight of capital adequacy,\nfor Citigroup and its\nsubsidiaries is governed by\neach entity\u2019s Asset and\nLiability Committee, where\napplicable.\n\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s capital\nplanning and stress testing\nexercises, see \u201cStress Testing\nComponent of Capital Planning\u201d\nbelow.\n                                                                \n  Current Regulatory Capital Standards                          \n                                                                \nCiti is subject to regulatory\ncapital rules issued by the\nFederal Reserve Board (FRB),\nin coordination with the OCC\nand FDIC, including the U.S.\nimplementation of the Basel\nIII rules (for information on\npotential changes to the Basel\nIII rules, see \u201cBasel III\nRevisions\u201d below). These rules\nestablish an\n\nintegrated capital adequacy\nframework, encompassing both\nrisk-based capital ratios and\nleverage ratios.\n                                                                \n  Risk-Based Capital Ratios                                     \n                                                                \nThe U.S. Basel III rules set\nforth the composition of\nregulatory capital (including\nthe application of regulatory\ncapital adjustments and\ndeductions), as well as two\ncomprehensive methodologies (a\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches) for\nmeasuring total risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nTotal risk-weighted assets\nunder the Standardized\nApproach include credit and\nmarket risk-weighted assets,\nwhich are generally prescribed\nsupervisory risk weights.\nTotal risk-weighted assets\nunder the Advanced Approaches,\nwhich are primarily model\nbased, include credit, market\nand operational risk-weighted\nassets. As a result, credit\nrisk-weighted assets\ncalculated under the Advanced\nApproaches are more risk\nsensitive than those\ncalculated under the\nStandardized Approach. Market\nrisk-weighted assets are\ncurrently calculated on a\ngenerally consistent basis\nunder both the Standardized\nand Advanced Approaches. The\nStandardized Approach does not\ninclude operational risk-\nweighted assets.\n\nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, Citigroup is required\nto maintain several regulatory\ncapital buffers above the\nstated minimum capital\nrequirements to avoid certain\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments\nto executive officers.\nAccordingly, for the fourth\nquarter of 2022, Citigroup\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio was 11.5% under\nthe Standardized Approach\n(incorporating its Stress\nCapital Buffer of 4.0% and\nGSIB (global systemically\nimportant bank) surcharge of\n3.0%) and 10.0% under the\nAdvanced Approaches (inclusive\nof the fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer and GSIB\nsurcharge of 3.0%).\n\nIn addition, commencing\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi\u2019s GSIB\nsurcharge increased from 3.0%\nto 3.5%, which is applicable\nto both the Standardized and\nAdvanced Approaches, resulting\nin a required CET1 Capital\nratio of 12.0% under the\nStandardized Approach and\n10.5% under the Advanced\nApproaches, both as of such\ndate (for additional\ninformation, see \u201c GSIB\nSurcharge \u201d below).\n\nSimilarly, Citigroup\u2019s primary\nsubsidiary, Citibank, N.A.\n(Citibank), is required to\nmaintain minimum regulatory\ncapital ratios plus applicable\nregulatory buffers, as well as\nhold sufficient capital to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d\nunder the Prompt Corrective\nAction framework. In effect,\nCitibank\u2019s required CET1\nCapital ratio was 7.0% under\nboth the Standardized and\nAdvanced Approaches, which is\nthe sum of the minimum 4.5%\nCET1 requirement and a fixed\n2.5% Capital Conservation\nBuffer. For additional\ninformation, see \u201cRegulatory\nCapital Buffers\u201d and \u201cPrompt\nCorrective Action Framework\u201d\nbelow.\n\nFurther, the U.S. Basel III\nrules implement the \u201ccapital\nfloor provision\u201d of the Dodd-\nFrank Act (the so-called\n\u201cCollins Amendment\u201d), which\nrequires banking organizations\nto calculate \u201cgenerally\napplicable\u201d capital\nrequirements. As a result,\nCiti must calculate each of\nthe three risk-based capital\nratios (CET1 Capital, Tier 1\nCapital and Total Capital)\nunder both the Standardized\nApproach and the Advanced\nApproaches and comply with the\nmore binding of each of the\nresulting risk-based capital\nratios.\n                               24                               \n                                                                \n  Tier 1 Leverage Ratio                                         \n                                                                \nUnder the U.S. Basel III\nrules, Citigroup is also\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nTier 1 Leverage ratio of 4.0%.\nSimilarly, Citibank is\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nTier 1 Leverage ratio of 5.0%\nto be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under the Prompt\nCorrective Action framework.\nThe Tier 1 Leverage ratio, a\nnon-risk-based measure of\ncapital adequacy, is defined\nas Tier 1 Capital as a\npercentage of quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nless amounts deducted from\nTier 1 Capital.\n                                                                \n  Supplementary Leverage Ratio                                  \n                                                                \nCiti is also required to\ncalculate a Supplementary\nLeverage ratio (SLR), which\ndiffers from the Tier 1\nLeverage ratio by including\ncertain off-balance sheet\nexposures within the\ndenominator of the ratio\n(Total Leverage Exposure). The\nSLR represents end-of-period\nTier 1 Capital to Total\nLeverage Exposure. Total\nLeverage Exposure is defined\nas the sum of (i) the daily\naverage of on-balance sheet\nassets for the quarter and\n(ii) the average of certain\noff-balance sheet exposures\ncalculated as of the last day\nof each month in the quarter,\nless applicable Tier 1 Capital\ndeductions. Advanced\nApproaches banking\norganizations are required to\nmaintain a stated minimum SLR\nof 3.0%.\n\nFurther, U.S. GSIBs, including\nCitigroup, are subject to a\n2.0% leverage buffer in\naddition to the 3.0% stated\nminimum SLR requirement,\nresulting in a 5.0% SLR. If a\nU.S. GSIB fails to exceed this\nrequirement, it will be\nsubject to increasingly\nstringent restrictions\n(depending upon the extent of\nthe shortfall) on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary executive bonus\npayments.\n\nSimilarly, Citibank is\nrequired to maintain a minimum\nSLR of 6.0% to be considered\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d under the\nPrompt Corrective Action\nframework.\n\nRegulatory Capital\nTreatment\u2014Modified Transition\nof the Current Expected Credit\nLosses Methodology\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking\nagencies issued a final rule\nthat modified the regulatory\ncapital transition provision\nrelated to the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology. The rule does not\nhave any impact on U.S. GAAP\naccounting.\n\nThe rule permitted banks to\ndelay for two years the \u201cDay\nOne\u201d adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology on January 1, 2020\nuntil January 1, 2022,\nfollowed by a three-year\ntransition to phase out the\nregulatory capital benefit\nprovided by the delay.\n\nIn addition, for the ongoing\nimpact of CECL, the agencies\nutilized a 25% scaling factor\nas an approximation of the\nincreased reserve build under\nCECL compared to the previous\nincurred loss model and,\ntherefore, allowed banks to\nadd back to CET1 Capital an\namount equal to 25% of the\nchange in CECL-based\nallowances in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2022, the\ncumulative 25% change in CECL-\nbased allowances between\nJanuary 1, 2020 and December\n31, 2021 started to be phased\nin to regulatory capital (i)\nat 25% per year on January 1\nof each year over the three-\nyear transition period and\n(ii) along with the delayed\nDay One impact.\n\nCitigroup and Citibank elected\nthe modified CECL transition\nprovision provided by the\nrule. Accordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from adoption of\n\nthe CECL methodology, as well\nas the ongoing adjustments for\n25% of the change in CECL-\nbased allowances in each\nquarter between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021,\nstarted to be phased in on\nJanuary 1, 2022 and will be\nfully reflected in Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital as of\nJanuary 1, 2025.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022,\nCitigroup\u2019s reported CET1\nCapital ratio of 13.0%\nbenefited from the deferrals\nof the CECL transition\nprovision by 24 basis points.\nFor additional information on\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital ratios\nexcluding the impact of the\nCECL transition provision, see\n\u201cCapital Resources (Full\nAdoption of CECL)\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Buffers                                    \n                                                                \nCitigroup and Citibank are\nrequired to maintain several\nregulatory capital buffers\nabove the stated minimum\ncapital requirements. These\ncapital buffers would be\navailable to absorb losses in\nadvance of any potential\nimpairment of regulatory\ncapital below the stated\nminimum regulatory capital\nratio requirements.\n\nBanking organizations that\nfall below their regulatory\ncapital buffers are subject to\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments\nto executive officers based on\na percentage of \u201cEligible\nRetained Income\u201d (ERI), with\nincreasing restrictions based\nupon the severity of the\nbreach. ERI is equal to the\ngreater of (i) the bank\u2019s net\nincome for the four calendar\nquarters preceding the current\ncalendar quarter, net of any\ndistributions and tax effects\nnot already reflected in net\nincome, and (ii) the average\nof the bank\u2019s net income for\nthe four calendar quarters\npreceding the current calendar\nquarter.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022,\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital\nratios exceeded the regulatory\ncapital requirements.\nAccordingly, Citi is not\nsubject to payout limitations\nas a result of the U.S. Basel\nIII requirements.\n                                                                \n  Stress Capital Buffer                                         \n                                                                \nCitigroup is subject to the\nFRB\u2019s Stress Capital Buffer\n(SCB) rule, which integrates\nthe annual stress testing\nrequirements with ongoing\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. The SCB equals\nthe peak-to-trough CET1\nCapital ratio decline under\nthe Supervisory Severely\nAdverse scenario over a nine-\nquarter period used in the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST), plus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, subject to a floor\nof 2.5%. SCB-based capital\nrequirements are reviewed and\nupdated annually by the FRB as\npart of the CCAR process. For\nadditional information\nregarding CCAR and DFAST, see\n\u201cStress Testing Component of\nCapital Planning\u201d below. The\nfixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer will\ncontinue to apply under the\nAdvanced Approaches (for\nadditional information, see\nbelow).\n\nIn August 2022, the FRB\nfinalized and announced Citi\u2019s\nSCB requirement of 4.0% for\nthe four-quarter window\nstarting from October 1, 2022\nto September 30, 2023.\n\nAccordingly, as of October 1,\n2022, Citi is required to\nmaintain an 11.5% required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, incorporating this\nSCB and its GSIB surcharge of\n3.0%. Previously, from October\n1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022, Citi had been subject to\na 3.0% SCB, and a 10.5%\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio\n                               25                               \nunder the Standardized\nApproach. Citi\u2019s required\nregulatory CET1 Capital ratio\nunder the Advanced Approaches\n(using the fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer) remains\nunchanged at 10.0%. The SCB\napplies to Citigroup only; the\nregulatory capital framework\napplicable to Citibank,\nincluding the Capital\nConservation Buffer, is\nunaffected by Citigroup\u2019s SCB.\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer Citigroup is subject to\na fixed 2.5% Capital\nConservation Buffer under the\nAdvanced Approaches. Citibank\nis subject to the fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nunder both the Advanced\nApproaches and the\nStandardized Approach. In\naddition, Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations, such as\nCitigroup and Citibank, are\nsubject to a discretionary\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer. The Countercyclical\nCapital Buffer is currently\nset at 0% by the U.S. banking\nagencies. GSIB Surcharge The\nFRB imposes a risk-based\ncapital surcharge upon U.S.\nbank holding companies that\nare identified as GSIBs,\nincluding Citi. The GSIB\nsurcharge augments the SCB,\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand, if invoked, any\nCountercyclical Capital\nBuffer. A U.S. bank holding\ncompany that is designated a\nGSIB is required, on an annual\nbasis, to calculate a\nsurcharge using two methods\nand is subject to the higher\nof the resulting two\nsurcharges. The first method\n(\u201cmethod 1\u201d) is based on the\nBasel Committee\u2019s GSIB\nmethodology. Under the second\nmethod (\u201cmethod 2\u201d), the\nsubstitutability category\nunder the Basel Committee\u2019s\nGSIB methodology is replaced\nwith a quantitative measure\nintended to assess a GSIB\u2019s\nreliance on short-term\nwholesale funding. In\naddition, method 1\nincorporates relative measures\nof systemic importance across\ncertain global banking\norganizations and a year-end\nspot foreign exchange rate,\nwhereas method 2 uses fixed\nmeasures of systemic\nimportance and application of\nan average foreign exchange\nrate over a three-year period.\nThe GSIB surcharges calculated\nunder both method 1 and method\n2 are based on measures of\nsystemic importance from the\nyear immediately preceding\nthat in which the GSIB\nsurcharge calculations are\nbeing performed (e.g., the\nmethod 1 and method 2 GSIB\nsurcharges calculated during\n2022 will be based on 2021\nsystemic indicator data).\nGenerally, Citi\u2019s surcharge\ndetermined under method 2 will\nresult in a higher surcharge\nthan its surcharge determined\nunder method 1. Should a\nGSIB\u2019s systemic importance\nchange year-over-year, such\nthat it becomes subject to a\nhigher GSIB surcharge, the\nhigher surcharge would become\neffective on January 1 of the\nyear that is one full calendar\nyear after the increased GSIB\nsurcharge was calculated\n(e.g., a higher surcharge\ncalculated in 2024 using data\nas of December 31, 2023 would\nnot become effective until\nJanuary 1, 2026). However, if\na GSIB\u2019s systemic importance\nchanges such that the GSIB\nwould be subject to a lower\nsurcharge, the GSIB would be\nsubject to the lower surcharge\non January 1 of the year\nimmediately following the\ncalendar year in which the\ndecreased GSIB surcharge was\ncalculated (e.g., a lower\nsurcharge calculated in 2024\nusing data as of December 31,\n2023 would become\n\neffective January 1, 2025).\nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s effective GSIB\nsurcharge as determined under\nmethod 1 and method 2 during\n2022 and 2021:\n                                  \n              2022       2021     \n  Method 1     2.0  %     2.0  %  \n  Method 2     3.0        3.0     \n                                  \nCiti\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective during both 2022 and\n2021 was 3.0%, as derived\nunder the higher method 2\nresult. Citi\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective for 2023 has\nincreased from 3.0% to 3.5%,\nas derived under the higher\nmethod 2 result. Citi expects\nthat its method 2 GSIB\nsurcharge will continue to\nremain higher than its method\n1 GSIB surcharge. Accordingly,\nbased on Citi\u2019s method 2\nresult as of December 31, 2021\nand its estimated method 2\nresult as of December 31,\n2022, Citi\u2019s GSIB surcharge is\nexpected to remain at 3.5%\neffective January 1, 2024.\nCiti\u2019s GSIB surcharge\neffective for 2025 will likely\nbe based on the lower of its\nmethod 2 scores for year-end\n2022 and 2023 and, therefore,\nis not expected to exceed\n3.5%. Prompt Corrective Action\nFramework In general, the\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nregulations direct the U.S.\nbanking agencies to enforce\nincreasingly strict\nlimitations on the activities\nof insured depository\ninstitutions that fail to meet\ncertain regulatory capital\nthresholds. The PCA framework\ncontains five categories of\ncapital adequacy as measured\nby risk-based capital and\nleverage ratios: (i) \u201cwell\ncapitalized,\u201d (ii) \u201cadequately\ncapitalized,\u201d (iii)\n\u201cundercapitalized,\u201d (iv)\n\u201csignificantly\nundercapitalized\u201d and (v)\n\u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d\nAccordingly, an insured\ndepository institution, such\nas Citibank, must maintain\nminimum CET1 Capital, Tier 1\nCapital, Total Capital and\nTier 1 Leverage ratios of\n6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%,\nrespectively, to be considered\n\u201cwell capitalized.\u201d In\naddition, insured depository\ninstitution subsidiaries of\nU.S. GSIBs, including\nCitibank, must maintain a\nminimum Supplementary Leverage\nratio of 6.0% to be considered\n\u201cwell capitalized.\u201d Citibank\nwas \u201cwell capitalized\u201d as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nFurthermore, to be \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under current\nfederal bank regulatory agency\ndefinitions, a bank holding\ncompany must have a Tier 1\nCapital ratio of at least\n6.0%, a Total Capital ratio of\nat least 10.0% and not be\nsubject to a FRB directive to\nmaintain higher capital\nlevels.\n                               26                               \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing Component of Capital Planning                  \n                                                                \nCiti is subject to an annual\nassessment by the FRB as to\nwhether Citigroup has\neffective capital planning\nprocesses as well as\nsufficient regulatory capital\nto absorb losses during\nstressful economic and\nfinancial conditions, while\nalso meeting obligations to\ncreditors and counterparties\nand continuing to serve as a\ncredit intermediary. This\nannual assessment includes two\nrelated programs: the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST).\n\nFor the largest and most\ncomplex firms, such as Citi,\nCCAR includes a qualitative\nevaluation of a firm\u2019s\nabilities to determine its\ncapital needs on a forward-\nlooking basis. In conducting\nthe qualitative assessment,\nthe FRB evaluates firms\u2019\ncapital planning practices,\nfocusing on six areas of\ncapital planning: governance,\nrisk management, internal\ncontrols, capital policies,\nincorporating stressful\nconditions and events, and\nestimating impact on capital\npositions. As part of the CCAR\nprocess, the FRB evaluates\nCiti\u2019s capital adequacy,\ncapital adequacy process and\nits planned capital\ndistributions, such as\ndividend payments and common\nshare repurchases. The FRB\nassesses whether Citi has\nsufficient capital to continue\noperations throughout times of\neconomic and financial market\nstress and whether Citi has\nrobust, forward-looking\ncapital planning processes\nthat account for its unique\nrisks.\n\nAll CCAR firms, including\nCiti, are subject to a\nrigorous evaluation of their\ncapital planning process.\nFirms with weak practices may\nbe subject to a deficient\nsupervisory rating, and\npotentially an enforcement\naction, for failing to meet\nsupervisory expectations.

The\nincrease in Citi\u2019s CET1\nCapital ratio was also\npartially offset by the impact\nof adopting the Standardized\nApproach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk (SA-CCR) on\nJanuary 1, 2022.\n\nCiti\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\ndecreased under the Advanced\nApproaches from year-end 2021,\ndue to the return of capital\nto common shareholders, the\ninterest rate impacts on\nCitigroup\u2019s investment\nportfolio and the impact of\nadopting the SA-CCR, partially\noffset by the net income of\n$14.8 billion and the impacts\nfrom the closing of the\nAustralia,

DTAs arising\nfrom net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business\ncredit tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted\nfrom CET1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising\nfrom temporary differences are required to be deducted from\ncapital only if they exceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S.\nBasel III rules.\n\n(5) Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs\narising from temporary differences and significant common stock\ninvestments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At\nDecember 31, 2022, this deduction related only to DTAs arising\nfrom temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation.

Commencing January 1,\n2022, non-grandfathered trust preferred securities have been\nfully phased out of Tier 2 Capital.\n\n(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit\nlosses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25%\nof credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for\ncredit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted\nassets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in\nwhich eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit\nlosses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the\nextent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit\nreserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible\nfor inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under\nthe Advanced Approaches framework

and a decrease in corporate lending, partially\noffset by an increase in card activities.\n\n(2) Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse\nrepurchase transactions, as well as securities borrowing and\nsecurities lending transactions. Repo-style transactions\ndecreased during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 primarily\ndue to reduced exposure in repurchase agreements and securities\nlending, as well as a decrease in margin loans.\n\n(3) Securitization exposures increased during the three and 12\nmonths ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to new exposures.\n\n(4) Equity exposures increased during the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in market value of\nvarious investments.\n\n(5) OTC derivatives decreased during the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2022 primarily due to decreases across FX,\ncommodities and equities.

indirect\nwholly owned subsidiary of\nCitigroup, had total\nregulatory capital of $27\nbillion at December 31, 2022,\nwhich exceeded the PRA\u2019s\nminimum regulatory capital\nrequirements.\n\nIn

(LTD),\neach set by reference to the\nGSIB\u2019s consolidated risk-\nweighted assets (RWA) and\ntotal leverage exposure.\nMinimum External TLAC\nRequirement The minimum\nexternal TLAC requirement is\nthe greater of (i) 18% of the\nGSIB\u2019s RWA plus the then-\napplicable RWA-based TLAC\nbuffer (see below) and (ii)\n7.5% of the GSIB\u2019s total\nleverage exposure plus a\nleverage-based TLAC buffer of\n2% (i.e., 9.5%). The RWA-based\nTLAC buffer equals the 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer,\nplus any applicable\nCountercyclical Capital Buffer\n(currently 0%), plus the\nGSIB\u2019s capital surcharge as\ndetermined under method 1 of\nthe GSIB surcharge rule (2.0%\nfor Citi for 2022).\nAccordingly, Citi\u2019s total\ncurrent minimum TLAC\nrequirement was 22.5% of RWA\nfor 2022. Minimum Long-Term\nDebt (LTD) Requirement The\nminimum LTD requirement is the\ngreater of (i) 6% of the\nGSIB\u2019s RWA plus its capital\nsurcharge as determined under\nmethod 2 of the GSIB surcharge\nrule (3.0% for Citi for 2022),\nfor a total current\nrequirement of 9% of RWA for\nCiti, and (ii) 4.5% of the\nGSIB\u2019s total leverage\nexposure.\n\nThe table below details Citi\u2019s\neligible external TLAC and LTD\namounts and ratios, and each\nTLAC and LTD regulatory\nrequirement, as well as the\nsurplus amount in dollars in\nexcess of each requirement.\n                                                                \n                              December 31, 2022                 \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In billions of                                                \n  dollars, except                 External TLAC         LTD     \n  ratios                                                        \n  Total eligible amount    $                334     $   160     \n  % of Advanced                                                 \n  Approaches risk-                         27.3  %     13.1  %  \n  weighted assets                                               \n  Regulatory                               22.5         9.0     \n  requirement(1)(2)                                             \n  Surplus amount           $                 59     $    50     \n  % of Total Leverage                      11.5  %      5.5  %  \n  Exposure                                                      \n  Regulatory                                9.5         4.5     \n  requirement                                                   \n  Surplus amount           $                 58     $    29     \n                                                                \n(1) External TLAC includes\nmethod 1 GSIB surcharge of\n2.0%.

In\naddition, SA-CCR is used in\nnumerous other instances\nthroughout the regulatory\nframework, including but not\nlimited to the Supplementary\nLeverage ratio, certain\ncomponents of the GSIB score,\nsingle counterparty credit\nlimits and legal lending\nlimits.\n\nAs previously disclosed, Citi\nadopted SA-CCR as of the\nmandatory compliance date of\nJanuary 1, 2022. Adoption of\nSA-CCR increased Citigroup\u2019s\nStandardized RWA by\napproximately $51 billion,\nwhich resulted in a 49 basis\npoints decrease to Citigroup\u2019s\nCET1 Capital ratio under the\nStandardized Approach on\nJanuary 1, 2022.\n\nAdoption of SA-CCR also\nincreased Citigroup\u2019s Advanced\nRWA by approximately $29\nbillion, which resulted in a\n29 basis points decrease to\nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nunder the Advanced Approaches\non January 1, 2022.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Standards Developments                     \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Basel III Revisions                                           \n                                                                \nAs described above, the U.S.\nbanking agencies implemented a\nnumber of international\ncapital standards adopted by\nthe Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee),\nfollowing the Global Financial\nCrisis regulatory reforms (see\nthe U.S. Basel III rules\ndiscussion above). The Basel\nCommittee finalized the Basel\nIII reforms in December 2017,\nwhich included revisions to\nthe methodologies in deriving\ncredit, market and operational\nrisk-weighted assets, the\nimposition of a new aggregate\noutput floor for risk-weighted\nassets and revisions to the\nleverage ratio framework.\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies may\nrevise the U.S. Basel III\nrules in the future, in\nresponse to the Basel\nCommittee\u2019s final Basel III\nreforms.

These include,\namong other things,\nsignificantly elevated levels\nof inflation, higher interest\nrates, global supply shocks\nand lower economic growth\nrates, as well as an\nincreasing risk of recession\nin Europe, the U.S. and other\ncountries.\n\nFor example, in 2022, the\nU.S., the U.K., the EU and\nother economies experienced\nsignificantly higher levels of\nwidespread inflation. As a\nresult, the Federal Reserve\nBoard (FRB) and other central\nbanks have substantially\nraised interest rates, reduced\nthe size of their balance\nsheets and taken other actions\nin an aggressive effort to\ncurb inflation. These actions\nare expected to slow economic\ngrowth, increase the risk of\nrecession and increase the\nunemployment rate in the U.S.\nand other countries, all of\nwhich would likely adversely\naffect Citi\u2019s consumer and\ninstitutional clients,\nbusinesses and results of\noperations. Elevated levels of\ninflation are also expected to\ncontinue to result in higher\nlabor and other costs, thus\nputting further pressure on\nCiti\u2019s expenses.\n\nInterest rates on loans Citi\nmakes are typically based off\nor set at a spread over a\nbenchmark interest rate and\nwould likely decline or rise\nas benchmark rates decline or\nrise, respectively. While Citi\nexpects its overall net\ninterest income would\ngenerally increase due to\nhigher interest rates, higher\nrates could adversely affect\nits funding costs, levels of\ndeposits in its consumer and\ninstitutional businesses and\ncertain business or product\nrevenues. Citi\u2019s net interest\nincome could be adversely\naffected due to a flattening\n(a lower spread between\nshorter-term versus longer-\nterm interest rates) or longer\nlasting or more severe\ninversion (shorter-term\ninterest rates exceeding\nlonger-term interest rates) of\nthe interest rate yield curve,\nas Citi, similar to other\nbanks, typically pays\n\ninterest on deposits based on\nshorter-term interest rates\nand earns money on loans based\non longer-term interest rates.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s interest rate risk, see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Market\nRisk\u2014Banking Book Interest\nRate Risk\u201d below.\nAdditionally, Citi\u2019s balance\nsheet includes interest-rate\nsensitive fixed-rate assets\nsuch as U.S. Treasuries, U.S.\nagency securities and\nresidential mortgages, among\nothers, whose valuation would\nbe adversely impacted in a\nrising-rate environment and/or\nwhose hedging costs may\nincrease.\n\nRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine has\ncaused supply shocks in\nenergy, food and other\ncommodities markets, worsened\ninflation, increased\ncybersecurity risks, increased\nthe risk of recession in\nEurope and heightened\ngeopolitical tensions. Actions\nby Russia, and any further\nmeasures taken by the U.S. or\nits allies, could continue to\nhave negative impacts on\nregional and global energy and\nother commodities and\nfinancial markets and\nmacroeconomic conditions,\nadversely impacting\njurisdictions where Citi\noperates and Citi\u2019s customers,\nclients and employees. Citi\u2019s\nability to continue to reduce\nits operations and exposure in\nRussia, including completion\nof the wind-down of its\nconsumer and local commercial\nbanking operations and nearly\nall of its institutional\nbanking services in the\ncountry, may be negatively\nimpacted by macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties,\nlocal market conditions, and\nsanctions and other\ngovernmental regulations or\nactions.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s remaining\noperations in Russia subject\nCiti to various other risks,\namong which are foreign\ncurrency volatility, including\nappreciations or devaluations;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory Russian laws and\nregulations on the conduct of\nits business, including,\nwithout limitation, its\nprovision to its customers of\ncertain securities services;\nsanctions or asset freezes;\nand other deconsolidation\nevents. Examples of triggers\nthat may result in\ndeconsolidation of Citi\u2019s\nsubsidiary bank in Russia, AO\nCitibank, include voluntary or\nforced sale of ownership or\nloss of control due to actions\nof relevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management. In the\nevent of a loss of control of\nAO Citibank, Citi would be\nrequired to write off its net\ninvestment in the entity,\nrecognize a CTA loss through\nearnings and recognize a loss\non intercompany liabilities\nowed by AO Citibank to other\nCiti entities outside of\nRussia. In the sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss through\nearnings and would evaluate\nits remaining net investment\nas circumstances evolve.\nAdditionally, Citi may incur\nreputational harm if its\nactions are perceived to be\nmisaligned with Citi\u2019s\nannounced reductions of its\noperations and exposure in\nRussia. For additional\ninformation about these risks,\nsee the operational processes\nand systems, cybersecurity and\nemerging markets risk factors\nand \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d below.\n\nCOVID-19 is expected to\ncontinue to adversely affect\nglobal health and could\nnegatively impact\nmacroeconomic conditions in\n2023. The extent of the impact\nremains uncertain\n                               41                               \nand will largely depend on\nfuture developments in China,\nthe U.S. and other countries,\nsuch as the severity and\nduration of the public health\nconsequences, including the\ncourse of variants; the public\nresponse; and government\nactions. COVID-19 could again\ndisrupt supply chains, worsen\ninflation and reduce economic\nactivity. These factors could\nadversely impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses and results of\noperations and financial\ncondition.\n\nAdditional areas of\nuncertainty include, among\nothers, economic and\ngeopolitical challenges\nrelated to China, including\nrelated policy actions,\ndistress in Chinese real\nestate finance and other\ncredit markets, tensions or\nconflicts between China and\nTaiwan and/or between China\nand the U.S.; significant\ndisruptions and volatility in\nfinancial markets, including\nforeign currency volatility\nand devaluations and continued\nstrength in the U.S. dollar;\nother geopolitical tensions\nand conflicts; protracted or\nwidespread trade tensions;\nfinancial market, other\neconomic and political\ndisruption driven by populist\nmovements and governments;\nnatural disasters; other\npandemics; and election\noutcomes, including the\neffects of divided government\nin the U.S., such as with\nrespect to raising of the\nfederal debt limit. For\nexample, Citi\u2019s market-making\nbusinesses can suffer losses\nresulting from the widening of\ncredit spreads due to\nunanticipated changes in\nfinancial markets. Moreover,\nadverse developments or\ndownturns in one or more of\nthe world\u2019s larger economies\nwould likely have a\nsignificant impact on the\nglobal economy or the\neconomies of other countries\nbecause of global financial\nand economic linkages.\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Ability to Return\nCapital to Common Shareholders\nSubstantially Depends on\nRegulatory Capital\nRequirements, Including the\nResults of the CCAR Process\nand Dodd-Frank Act Regulatory\nStress Tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to return\ncapital to its common\nshareholders consistent with\nits capital planning efforts\nand targets, whether through\nits common stock dividend or\nthrough a share repurchase\nprogram, substantially\ndepends, among other things,\non regulatory capital\nrequirements, including the\nannual recalibration of the\nStress Capital Buffer (SCB),\nwhich is based upon the\nresults of the CCAR process\nrequired by the FRB, and\nrecalibration of the GSIB\nsurcharge.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to return\ncapital also depends on its\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition, including\nthe capital impact related to\nits remaining divestitures,\nsuch as, among other things,\nany temporary capital impact\nfrom CTA losses (net of\nhedges) between transaction\nsignings and closings and\nachievement of the expected\ncapital benefits from the\ndivestitures (for additional\ninformation, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d above and the\ncontinued investments risk\nfactor below); Citi\u2019s\neffectiveness in planning,\nmanaging and calculating its\nlevel of risk-weighted assets\nunder both the Advanced\nApproaches and the\nStandardized Approach,\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\n(SLR) and GSIB surcharge; its\nimplementation and maintenance\nof an effective capital\nplanning process and\nmanagement framework;\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions; and deferred tax\nasset (DTA) utilization (see\nthe ability to utilize DTA\nrisk factor below).\n\nChanges in regulatory capital\nrules, requirements or\ninterpretations could continue\nto have a material impact on\nCiti\u2019s regulatory capital. For\nexample, on October 1, 2022,\nCiti\u2019s required regulatory\nCET1 Capital ratio increased\nto 11.5% from 10.5% due to an\nincrease in the SCB\nrequirement (see below for\ninformation on calculation of\nthe SCB). In addition, on\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio further\nincreased to 12% from 11.5%\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, as the current GSIB\nsurcharge increased to 3.5%\nfrom 3.0%. Due to these\nincreases as well as\nmacroeconomic uncertainty,\nCiti paused common share\nrepurchases beginning as of\nthe third quarter of 2022. In\naddition, the U.S. banking\nagencies are considering a\nnumber of changes to the U.S.\nregulatory capital framework\nin the future, including, but\nnot limited to, revisions to\nthe U.S. Basel III rules, and\npotential changes to the GSIB\nsurcharge, SLR and\ndiscretionary Countercyclical\nCapital Buffer. All of these\npotential changes could\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital position or\nincrease Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital requirements.\n\nAll firms subject to CCAR\nrequirements, including Citi,\nwill continue to be subject to\na rigorous regulatory\nevaluation of capital planning\npractices, including, but not\nlimited to, governance, risk\nmanagement, data quality and\ninternal controls. Citi\u2019s\nability to return capital may\nbe adversely impacted if such\nan evaluation of Citi results\nin negative findings. The FRB\nhas stated that it expects\ncapital adequacy practices to\ncontinue to evolve and to\nlikely be determined by its\nyearly cross-firm review of\ncapital plan submissions.\nSimilarly, the FRB has\nindicated that, as part of its\nstated goal to continually\nevolve its annual stress\ntesting requirements, several\nparameters of the annual\nstress testing process may\ncontinue to be altered,\nincluding the severity of the\nstress test scenario, the FRB\nmodeling of Citi\u2019s balance\nsheet, pre-provision net\nrevenue and stress losses, and\nthe addition of components\ndeemed important by the FRB.\nFor information on limitations\non Citi\u2019s ability to return\ncapital to common\nshareholders, as well as the\nCCAR process, supervisory\nstress test requirements and\nGSIB surcharge, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Overview\u201d and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Stress\nTesting Component of Capital\nPlanning\u201d above and the risk\nmanagement risk factor below.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022,\nCiti was required to phase\ninto regulatory capital, at\n25% per year, the changes in\nretained earnings, DTAs and\nACL determined upon the\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL adoption\ndate, as well as subsequent\nchanges in the ACL through\nDecember 31, 2021. The FRB has\nstated that it plans to\nmaintain its current framework\nfor calculating allowances on\nloans in the supervisory\nstress test through the 2023\nsupervisory stress test cycle,\nwhile continuing to evaluate\nappropriate future\nenhancements to this\nframework. The impacts on\nCiti\u2019s capital adequacy of the\nFRB\u2019s incorporation of CECL\ninto its supervisory stress\ntests on an ongoing basis, and\nof other potential regulatory\nchanges in the FRB\u2019s stress\ntesting methodologies, remain\nunclear. For additional\ninformation regarding the CECL\nmethodology, including the\ntransition provisions related\nto the adverse regulatory\ncapital effects resulting from\nadoption of the CECL\nmethodology, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Current Regulatory\nCapital Standards\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Treatment\u2014Modified\n                               42                               \nTransition of the Current\nExpected Credit Losses\nMethodology\u201d above and Note 1.\n\nIn addition, the annual stress\ntesting requirements are\nintegrated into ongoing\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. Citi\u2019s SCB\nequals the maximum decline in\nits CET1 Capital ratio under\nthe supervisory severely\nadverse scenario over a nine-\nquarter CCAR measurement\nperiod, plus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, subject to a\nminimum requirement of 2.5%.\nThe SCB is calculated by the\nFRB using its proprietary data\nand modeling of each firm\u2019s\nresults. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nSCB may change annually, based\non the supervisory stress test\nresults, thus potentially\nresulting in additional\nvolatility in the calculation\nof Citi\u2019s required regulatory\nCET1 Capital ratio under the\nStandardized Approach. Similar\nto the other regulatory\ncapital buffers, a breach of\nthe SCB may result in\ngraduated limitations on\ncapital distributions. For\nadditional information on the\nSCB, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nBuffers\u201d above.\n\nAlthough various uncertainties\nexist regarding the extent of,\nand the ultimate impact to\nCiti from, these changes to\nthe FRB\u2019s regulatory capital,\nstress testing and CCAR\nregimes, these changes could\nincrease the level of capital\nCiti is required or elects to\nhold, including as part of\nCiti\u2019s management buffer, thus\npotentially impacting the\nextent to which Citi is able\nto return capital to\nshareholders.\n\nCiti Must Continually Review,\nAnalyze and Successfully Adapt\nto Ongoing Regulatory and\nLegislative Uncertainties and\nChanges in the U.S. and\nGlobally.\n\nCiti, its management and its\nbusinesses continue to face\nongoing regulatory and\nlegislative uncertainties and\nchanges, both in the U.S. and\nglobally. While the areas of\nongoing regulatory and\nlegislative uncertainties and\nchanges facing Citi are too\nnumerous to list completely,\nexamples include, but are not\nlimited to (i) potential\nfiscal, monetary, tax,\nsanctions and other changes\npromulgated by the U.S.\nfederal government and other\ngovernments, including as a\nresult of priority shifts\ndepending on individuals,\npolitical parties and other\ngroups in governmental\npositions; (ii) potential\nchanges to various aspects of\nthe regulatory capital\nframework and requirements\napplicable to Citi, including\nthe Basel III rules (see the\ncapital return risk factor and\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards\nDevelopments\u201d above); and\n(iii) rapidly evolving\nlegislative and regulatory\nrequirements and other\ngovernment initiatives in the\nU.S. and globally related to\nclimate change and other ESG\nareas that vary, and may\nconflict, across\njurisdictions, including any\nnew disclosure requirements\n(see the climate change risk\nfactor below). References to\n\u201cregulatory\u201d refer to both\nformal regulation and the\nviews and expectations of\nCiti\u2019s regulators in their\nsupervisory roles.\n\nFor example, in February 2023,\nthe Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau proposed\nsignificant changes to the\nmaximum amounts on credit card\nlate fees, which, if adopted\nas proposed, would reduce\ncredit card fee revenues in\nBranded cards and Retail\nservices in PBWM . In\naddition, U.S. and\ninternational regulatory and\nlegislative initiatives have\nnot always been undertaken or\nimplemented on a coordinated\nbasis, and areas of divergence\nhave developed and continue to\ndevelop with respect to their\nscope, interpretation, timing,\nstructure or approach, leading\nto inconsistent or even\n\nconflicting requirements,\nincluding within a single\njurisdiction. For example, in\n2019, the European Commission\nadopted, as part of Capital\nRequirements Directive V (CRD\nV), a new requirement for\nmajor banking groups\nheadquartered outside the EU\n(which would include Citi) to\nestablish an intermediate EU\nholding company where the\nforeign bank has two or more\ninstitutions (broadly meaning\nbanks, broker-dealers and\nsimilar financial firms)\nestablished in the EU. While\nin some respects the\nrequirement mirrors an\nexisting U.S. requirement for\nnon-U.S. banking organizations\nto form U.S. intermediate\nholding companies, the\nimplementation of the EU\nholding company requirement\ncould lead to additional\ncomplexity with respect to\nCiti\u2019s resolution planning,\ncapital and liquidity\nallocation and efficiency in\nvarious jurisdictions.\n\nFurther, ongoing regulatory\nand legislative uncertainties\nand changes make Citi\u2019s and\nits management\u2019s long-term\nbusiness, balance sheet and\nstrategic budget planning\ndifficult, subject to change\nand potentially more costly\nand may impact its results of\noperations. U.S. and other\nregulators globally have\nimplemented and continue to\ndiscuss various changes to\ncertain regulatory\nrequirements, which would\nrequire ongoing assessment by\nmanagement as to the impact to\nCiti, its businesses and\nbusiness planning. For\nexample, while the Basel III\nregulatory reforms and revised\nmarket risk framework have\nbeen finalized at the\ninternational level, there\nremain significant\nuncertainties with respect to\nthe integration of these\nrevisions into the U.S.\nregulatory capital framework.\nBusiness planning is required\nto be based on possible or\nproposed rules or outcomes,\nwhich can change dramatically\nupon finalization, or upon\nimplementation or interpretive\nguidance from numerous\nregulatory bodies worldwide,\nand such guidance can change.\nRegulatory and legislative\nchanges have also\nsignificantly increased Citi\u2019s\ncompliance risks and costs\n(see the implementation and\ninterpretation of regulatory\nchanges risk factor below) and\ncan adversely affect Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition.\n\nCiti\u2019s Continued Investment\nand Other Initiatives as Part\nof Its Transformation and\nStrategic Refresh May Not Be\nas Successful as It Projects\nor Expects.\n\nAs part of its transformation\nand other strategic\ninitiatives, Citi continues to\nmake significant investments\nto improve its risk and\ncontrol environment, modernize\nits data and technology\ninfrastructure and further\nenhance safety and soundness\n(for additional information on\nthese investments, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d above and\nthe legal and regulatory\nproceedings risk factor\nbelow). Citi also continues to\nmake business-led investments,\nas part of the execution of\nits strategic refresh. For\nexample, Citi has been making\ninvestments across the\nCompany, including, for\nexample, hiring front office\ncolleagues and enhancing\nproduct capabilities and\nplatforms to improve client\ndigital experiences and add\nscalability and implementing\nnew capabilities and\npartnerships. Citi has also\nbeen pursuing productivity\nimprovements through various\ntechnology and digital\ninitiatives, organizational\nsimplification and location\nstrategies.\n\nCiti\u2019s multiyear\ntransformation initiatives\ninvolve significant execution\ncomplexity, and there is\ninherent risk that these will\nnot be as productive or\neffective as Citi expects,\n                               43                               \nor at all. Conversely, failure\nto properly invest in and\nupgrade Citi\u2019s technology and\nprocesses could result in\nCiti\u2019s inability to meet\nregulatory expectations, be\nsufficiently competitive,\nserve clients effectively and\navoid operational errors (for\nadditional information, see\nthe operational processes and\nsystems and legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactors below). Moreover,\nCiti\u2019s ability to achieve\nexpected returns on its\ninvestments and productivity\nimprovements depends, in part,\non factors that it cannot\ncontrol, including, among\nothers, macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties;\ncustomer, client and\ncompetitor actions; and\nongoing regulatory\nrequirements or changes.\n\nCiti\u2019s strategic refresh also\nincludes the divestiture of\nits remaining consumer banking\nbusinesses in Legacy\nFranchises , including Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM, in order to\nsimplify the Company and\nenhance its allocation of\nresources. These divestitures\ninvolve significant\nuncertainty and execution\ncomplexity, and may result in\nadditional CTA or other\nlosses, charges or other\nnegative financial or\nstrategic impacts, which could\nbe material (for information\nabout risks related to Citi\u2019s\noperations in Russia, see the\nmacroeconomic challenges and\nuncertainties risk factor\nabove and \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d below). For\nadditional information about\nCTA losses, see \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and the capital\nreturn risk factor above and\nthe incorrect assumptions or\nestimates risk factor below.\n\nCiti\u2019s investment and other\ninitiatives may continue to\nevolve as its business\nstrategies, the market\nenvironment and regulatory\nexpectations change, which\ncould make the initiatives\nmore costly and more\nchallenging to implement, and\nlimit their effectiveness.\n\nClimate Change Presents\nVarious Financial and Non-\nFinancial Risks to Citi and\nits Customers and Clients.\n\nClimate change presents both\nimmediate and long-term risks\nto Citi and its customers and\nclients, with the risks\nexpected to increase over\ntime. Climate risks can arise\nfrom both physical risks\n(those risks related to the\nphysical effects of climate\nchange) and transition risks\n(risks related to regulatory,\nmarket, technological,\nstakeholder and legal changes\nfrom a transition to a low-\ncarbon economy). Physical and\ntransition risks can manifest\nthemselves differently across\nCiti\u2019s risk categories in the\nshort, medium and long terms.\nPhysical risks from climate\nchange include acute risks,\nsuch as hurricanes and floods,\nas well as consequences of\nchronic changes in climate,\nsuch as rising sea levels,\nprolonged droughts and\nsystemic changes to\ngeographies and any resulting\npopulation migration. Such\nphysical risks could have\nadverse financial, operational\nand other impacts on Citi,\nboth directly on its business\nand operations, and indirectly\nas a result of impacts to\nCiti\u2019s clients, customers,\nvendors and other\ncounterparties. These impacts\ncan include destruction,\ndamage or impairment of\nproperties and other assets,\ndisruptions to business\noperations and supply chains\nand reduced availability or\nincrease in the cost of\ninsurance. Physical risks can\nalso impact Citi\u2019s credit risk\nexposures, for example, in its\nmortgage and commercial real\nestate lending businesses.\n\nTransition risks may arise\nfrom changes in regulations or\nmarket preferences toward low-\ncarbon industries or sectors,\nwhich in turn could have\nnegative impacts on asset\nvalues,\n\nresults of operations or the\nreputations of Citi and its\ncustomers and clients. For\nexample, Citi\u2019s corporate\ncredit exposures include oil\nand gas, power and other\nindustries that may experience\nreduced demand for carbon-\nintensive products due to the\ntransition to a low-carbon\neconomy. Failure to adequately\nconsider transition risk in\ndeveloping and executing on\nits business strategy could\nlead to a loss of market\nshare, lower revenues and\nhigher credit costs.\n\nAdditionally, if Citi\u2019s\nresponse to climate change is\nperceived to be ineffective or\ninsufficient or Citi is unable\nto achieve its objectives or\ncommitments relating to\nclimate change, its\nbusinesses, reputation,\nattractiveness to certain\ninvestors and efforts to\nrecruit and retain employees\nmay suffer. For example, the\nneed to decarbonize in a\ngradual and orderly way, while\npromoting energy security, may\nlead to continued exposure to\ncarbon-intensive activity that\nin turn may raise such\nreputational risks.\n\nEven as some regulators seek\nto mandate additional\ndisclosure of climate-related\ninformation, Citi\u2019s ability to\ncomply with such requirements\nand conduct more robust\nclimate-related risk analyses\nmay be hampered by lack of\ninformation and reliable data.\nData on climate-related risks\nis limited in availability,\noften based on estimated or\nunverified figures, collected\nand reported on a lag, and\nvariable in quality. Modeling\ncapabilities to analyze\nclimate-related risks and\ninterconnections are\nimproving, but remain\nincomplete. Moreover, U.S. and\nnon-U.S. banking regulators\nand others are increasingly\nfocusing on the issue of\nclimate risk at financial\ninstitutions, both directly\nand with respect to their\nclients. For example, in\nDecember 2022, the FRB\nrequested comment on draft\nprinciples that would provide\na high-level framework for the\nsafe and sound management of\nexposures to climate-related\nfinancial risks for FRB-\nsupervised financial\ninstitutions with more than\n$100 billion in assets.\n\nLegislative and regulatory\nchanges and uncertainties\nregarding climate-related risk\nmanagement and disclosures are\nlikely to result in higher\nregulatory, compliance,\ncredit, reputational and other\nrisks and costs for Citi (for\nadditional information, see\nthe ongoing regulatory and\nlegislative uncertainties and\nchanges risk factor above). In\naddition, Citi could face\nincreased regulatory,\nreputational and legal\nscrutiny as a result of its\nclimate risk, sustainability\nand other ESG-related\ncommitments and disclosures.\nCiti also faces potentially\nconflicting anti-ESG\ninitiatives from certain U.S.\nstate governments that may\nimpact its ability to conduct\ncertain business within those\njurisdictions, as well as from\nCongress.\n\nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nclimate and other\nsustainability initiatives,\nsee \u201cSustainability and Other\nESG Matters\u201d below. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s management of climate\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Strategic Risks\u2014Climate\nRisk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s Ability to Utilize Its\nDTAs, and Thus Reduce the\nNegative Impact of the DTAs on\nCiti\u2019s Regulatory Capital,\nWill Be Driven by Its Ability\nto Generate U.S. Taxable\nIncome.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Citi\u2019s\nnet DTAs were $27.7 billion,\nnet of a valuation allowance\nof $2.4 billion, of which\n$10.9 billion was deducted\nfrom Citi\u2019s CET1 Capital under\nthe U.S.\n                               44                               \nBasel III rules, primarily\nrelating to net operating\nlosses, foreign tax credit and\ngeneral business credit carry-\nforwards. Of the net DTAs at\nDecember 31, 2022, $1.9\nbillion related to foreign tax\ncredit (FTC) carry-forwards,\nnet of a valuation allowance.\nThe carry-forward utilization\nperiod for FTCs is 10 years\nand represents the most time-\nsensitive component of Citi\u2019s\nDTAs. The FTC carry-forwards\nat December 31, 2022 expire\nover the period of 2025\u20132029.\nCiti must utilize any FTCs\ngenerated in the then-current-\nyear tax return prior to\nutilizing any carry-forward\nFTCs.\n\nThe accounting treatment for\nrealization of DTAs, including\nFTCs, is complex and requires\nsignificant judgment and\nestimates regarding future\ntaxable earnings in the\njurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise and available tax\nplanning strategies. Forecasts\nof future taxable earnings\nwill depend upon various\nfactors, including, among\nothers, macroeconomic\nconditions. In addition, any\nfuture increase in U.S.\ncorporate tax rates could\nresult in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s DTA, which may subject\nmore of Citi\u2019s existing DTA to\nexclusion from regulatory\ncapital while improving Citi\u2019s\nability to utilize its FTC\ncarry-forwards.\n\nCiti\u2019s overall ability to\nrealize its DTAs will\nprimarily be dependent upon\nits ability to generate U.S.\ntaxable income in the relevant\ntax carry-forward periods.\nAlthough utilization of FTCs\nin any year is generally\nlimited to 21% of foreign\nsource taxable income in that\nyear, overall domestic losses\n(ODL) that Citi has incurred\nin the past allow it to\nreclassify domestic source\nincome as foreign source.\nFailure to realize any portion\nof the net DTAs would have a\ncorresponding negative impact\non Citi\u2019s net income and\nfinancial returns. Citi has\nnot been and does not expect\nto be subject to the Base\nErosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT),\nwhich, if applicable to Citi\nin any given year, would have\na significantly adverse effect\non both Citi\u2019s net income and\nregulatory capital. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s DTAs, including FTCs,\nsee \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d below\nand Notes 1 and 9.\n\nCiti\u2019s Interpretation or\nApplication of the Complex Tax\nLaws to Which It Is Subject\nCould Differ from Those of\nGovernmental Authorities,\nWhich Could Result in\nLitigation or Examinations and\nthe Payment of Additional\nTaxes, Penalties or Interest.\n\nCiti is subject to various\nincome-based tax laws of the\nU.S. and its states and\nmunicipalities, as well as the\nnumerous non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which it\noperates. These tax laws are\ninherently complex, and Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these laws to\nits entities, operations and\nbusinesses.\n\nFor example, the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) Pillar 2\ninitiative contemplates a 15%\nglobal minimum tax with\nrespect to earnings in each\nseparate country. EU member\nstates are required to adopt\nthe OECD Pillar 2 rules in\n2023, and other non-U.S.\ncountries are expected to\nfollow suit. Under these\nrules, Citi will be required\nto pay a \u201ctop-up\u201d tax to the\nextent that Citi\u2019s effective\ntax rate in any given country\nis below 15%. The U.S. is not\nexpected to pass Pillar 2\nlegislation in the near term,\nbut the top-up tax can be\ncollected by other countries.\nWhile many aspects of the\n\napplication of the rules\nremain uncertain, Citi does\nnot expect a material effect\nto its earnings.\n\nIn addition, Citi is subject\nto litigation or examinations\nwith U.S. and non-U.S. tax\nauthorities regarding non-\nincome-based tax matters.\nWhile Citi has appropriately\nreserved for such matters\nwhere there is a probable\nloss, and has disclosed, as\nreasonably possible, matters\nthat are more-likely-than-not,\nthe outcome from the matters\nmay be different than Citi\u2019s\nexpectations. Citi\u2019s\ninterpretations or application\nof the tax laws, including\nwith respect to withholding,\nstamp, service and other non-\nincome taxes, could differ\nfrom that of the relevant\ngovernmental taxing authority,\nwhich could result in the\nrequirement to pay additional\ntaxes, penalties or interest,\nwhich could be material. See\nNote 29 for additional\ninformation on litigation and\nexaminations involving\nnon-U.S. tax authorities.\n\nA Deterioration in or Failure\nto Maintain Citi\u2019s Co-Branding\nor Private Label Credit Card\nRelationships Could Have a\nNegative Impact on Citi.\n\nCiti has co-branding and\nprivate label relationships\nthrough its Branded cards and\nRetail services credit card\nbusinesses with various\nretailers and merchants,\nwhereby in the ordinary course\nof business Citi issues credit\ncards to customers of the\nretailers or merchants. The\nfive largest relationships\nacross both businesses in U.S.\nPersonal Banking constituted\nan aggregate of approximately\n10% of Citi\u2019s revenues in 2022\n(for additional information,\nsee \u201c Personal Banking and\nWealth Management \u201d above).\nCiti\u2019s co-branding and private\nlabel agreements often provide\nfor shared economics between\nthe parties and generally have\na fixed term.\n\nCompetition among card\nissuers, including Citi, for\nthese relationships is\nsignificant, and Citi may not\nbe able to maintain such\nrelationships on existing\nterms or at all. Citi\u2019s co-\nbranding and private label\nrelationships could also be\nnegatively impacted by, among\nother things, the general\neconomic environment,\nincluding the impacts of\nsignificantly elevated levels\nof inflation, higher interest\nrates, global supply shocks\nand lower economic growth\nrates, as well as an\nincreasing risk of recession;\nchanges in consumer sentiment,\nspending patterns and credit\ncard usage behaviors; a\ndecline in sales and revenues,\npartner store closures, any\nreduction in air and business\ntravel, or other operational\ndifficulties of the retailer\nor merchant; early termination\ndue to a contractual breach or\nexercise of other early\ntermination right; or other\nfactors, including\nbankruptcies, liquidations,\nrestructurings, consolidations\nor other similar events,\nwhether due to the challenging\nmacroeconomic environment or\notherwise.\n\nThese events, particularly\nearly termination and\nbankruptcies or liquidations,\ncould negatively impact the\nresults of operations or\nfinancial condition of Branded\ncards, Retail services or Citi\nas a whole, including as a\nresult of loss of revenues,\nincreased expenses, higher\ncost of credit, impairment of\npurchased credit card\nrelationships and contract-\nrelated intangibles or other\nlosses (see Note 16 for\ninformation on Citi\u2019s credit\ncard related intangibles\ngenerally).\n                               45                               \nCiti\u2019s Inability in Its\nResolution Plan Submissions to\nAddress Any Shortcomings or\nDeficiencies or Guidance\nProvided Could Subject Citi to\nMore Stringent Capital,\nLeverage or Liquidity\nRequirements, or Restrictions\non Its Growth, Activities or\nOperations, and Could\nEventually Require Citi to\nDivest Assets or Operations.\n\nTitle I of the Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires Citi to prepare and\nsubmit a plan to the FRB and\nthe FDIC for the orderly\nresolution of Citigroup (the\nbank holding company) and its\nsignificant legal entities\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code\nin the event of future\nmaterial financial distress or\nfailure. On November 22, 2022,\nthe FRB and FDIC issued\nfeedback on the resolution\nplans filed on July 1, 2021 by\nthe eight U.S. GSIBs,\nincluding Citi. The FRB and\nFDIC identified one\nshortcoming, but no\ndeficiencies, in Citi\u2019s 2021\nresolution plan. The\nshortcoming related to data\nintegrity and data quality\nmanagement issues,\nspecifically, weaknesses in\nCiti\u2019s processes and practices\nfor producing certain data\nthat could materially impact\nits resolution capabilities.\nIf a shortcoming is not\nsatisfactorily explained or\naddressed before, or in, the\nsubmission of the next\nresolution plan, the\nshortcoming may be found to be\na deficiency in the next\nresolution plan. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s resolution plan\nsubmissions, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n\nUnder Title I, if the FRB and\nthe FDIC jointly determine\nthat Citi\u2019s resolution plan is\nnot \u201ccredible\u201d (which,\nalthough not defined, is\ngenerally believed to mean the\nregulators do not believe the\nplan is feasible or would\notherwise allow Citi to be\nresolved in a way that\nprotects systemically\nimportant functions without\nsevere systemic disruption),\nor would not facilitate an\norderly resolution of Citi\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy\nCode, and Citi fails to\nresubmit a resolution plan\nthat remedies any identified\ndeficiencies, Citi could be\nsubjected to more stringent\ncapital, leverage or liquidity\nrequirements, or restrictions\non its growth, activities or\noperations. If within two\nyears from the imposition of\nany such requirements or\nrestrictions Citi has still\nnot remediated any identified\ndeficiencies, then Citi could\neventually be required to\ndivest certain assets or\noperations. Any such\nrestrictions or actions would\nnegatively impact Citi\u2019s\nreputation, market and\ninvestor perception,\noperations and strategy.\n\nCiti\u2019s Performance and Its\nAbility to Effectively Execute\nIts Transformation and Other\nStrategic Initiatives Could Be\nNegatively Impacted if It Is\nNot Able to Compete for,\nRetain and Motivate Highly\nQualified Colleagues.\n\nRecent employment conditions\nand inflationary pressures\nhave made the competition to\nhire and retain qualified\nemployees significantly more\nchallenging and costly. Citi\u2019s\nperformance and the\nperformance of its individual\nbusinesses largely depend on\nthe talents and efforts of its\ndiverse and highly qualified\ncolleagues. Specifically,\nCiti\u2019s continued ability to\ncompete in each of its lines\nof business, to manage its\nbusinesses effectively and to\nexecute its transformation and\nother strategic initiatives,\nincluding, for example, hiring\nfront office colleagues to\ngrow businesses or hiring\ncolleagues to support\ntransformation of its risk,\ncontrols, data and finance\ninfrastructure and compliance,\ndepends on its ability to\nattract new colleagues and to\nretain and motivate its\nexisting\n\ncolleagues. If Citi is unable\nto continue to attract, retain\nand motivate the most highly\nqualified colleagues, Citi\u2019s\nperformance, including its\ncompetitive position, the\nexecution of its\ntransformation and other\nstrategic initiatives and its\nresults of operations could be\nnegatively impacted.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to attract,\nretain and motivate colleagues\ndepends on numerous factors,\nsome of which are outside of\nits control. For example, the\ncompetition for talent\nrecently has been particularly\nintense, and attrition rates\nhave risen due to factors such\nas low unemployment, a strong\njob market with a large number\nof open positions, and changes\nin worker\u2019s expectations,\nconcerns and preferences, in\npart due to the pandemic,\nincluding an increased demand\nfor remote work options and\nother job flexibility. Also,\nthe banking industry generally\nis subject to more\ncomprehensive regulation of\nemployee compensation than\nother industries, including\ndeferral and clawback\nrequirements for incentive\ncompensation, which can make\nit unusually challenging for\nCiti to compete in labor\nmarkets against businesses,\nincluding for example\ntechnology companies, that are\nnot subject to such\nregulation. Other factors that\ncould impact its ability to\nattract, retain and motivate\ncolleagues include, among\nother things, Citi\u2019s presence\nin a particular market or\nregion, the professional and\ndevelopment opportunities and\nemployee benefits it offers,\nits reputation and its\ndiversity. For information on\nCiti\u2019s colleagues and\nworkforce management, see\n\u201cHuman Capital Resources and\nManagement\u201d below.\n\nCiti Faces Increased\nCompetitive Challenges,\nIncluding from Financial\nServices and Other Companies\nand Emerging Technologies.\n\nCiti operates in an\nincreasingly evolving and\ncompetitive business\nenvironment, which includes\nboth financial and non-\nfinancial services firms, such\nas traditional banks, online\nbanks, financial technology\ncompanies and others. These\ncompanies compete on the basis\nof, among other factors, size,\nreach, quality and type of\nproducts and services offered,\nprice, technology and\nreputation. Certain\ncompetitors may be subject to\ndifferent and, in some cases,\nless stringent legal and\nregulatory requirements,\nwhether due to size,\njurisdiction, entity type or\nother factors, placing Citi at\na competitive disadvantage.\n\nFor example, Citi competes\nwith other financial services\ncompanies in the U.S. and\nglobally that continue to\ndevelop and introduce new\nproducts and services. In\nrecent years, non-traditional\nfinancial services firms, such\nas financial technology\ncompanies, have begun to offer\nservices traditionally\nprovided by financial\ninstitutions, such as Citi,\nand have sought bank charters\nto provide these services.\nThese firms attempt to use\ntechnology and mobile\nplatforms to enhance the\nability of companies and\nindividuals to borrow, save\nand invest money. Emerging\ntechnologies have the\npotential to intensify\ncompetition and accelerate\ndisruption in the financial\nservices industry. For\nexample, despite recent\nturmoil in the digital asset\nmarket, there is sustained\ninterest from clients and\ninvestors in digital assets.\nFinancial services firms and\nother market participants have\nbegun to offer services\nrelated to those assets.\nHowever, Citi may not be able\nto provide the same or similar\nservices for legal or\nregulatory reasons and due to\nincreased compliance and other\nrisks. In\n                               46                               \naddition, changes in the\npayments space (e.g., instant\nand 24x7 payments) are\naccelerating, and, as a\nresult, certain of Citi\u2019s\nproducts and services could\nbecome less competitive.\n\nIncreased competition and\nemerging technologies have\nrequired and could require\nCiti to change or adapt its\nproducts and services to\nattract and retain customers\nor clients or to compete more\neffectively with competitors,\nincluding new market entrants.\nSimultaneously, as Citi\ndevelops new products and\nservices leveraging emerging\ntechnologies, new risks may\nemerge that, if not designed\nand governed adequately, may\nresult in control gaps and in\nCiti operating outside of its\nrisk appetite. For example,\ninstant and 24x7 payments\nproducts could be accompanied\nby challenges to forecasting\nand managing liquidity, as\nwell as increased operational\nand compliance risks.\n\nMoreover, Citi relies on third\nparties to support certain of\nits product and service\nofferings, which may put Citi\nat a disadvantage to\ncompetitors who may directly\noffer a broader array of\nproducts and services. Also,\nCiti\u2019s businesses, results of\noperations and reputation may\nsuffer if any third party is\nunable to provide adequate\nsupport for such product and\nservice offerings, whether due\nto operational incidents or\notherwise (for additional\ninformation, see the\noperational processes and\nsystems, cybersecurity and\nemerging markets risk factors\nbelow).\n\nTo the extent that Citi is not\nable to compete effectively\nwith financial technology\ncompanies and other firms,\nCiti could be placed at a\ncompetitive disadvantage,\nwhich could result in loss of\ncustomers and market share,\nand its businesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition could suffer. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s competitors, see the\nco-brand and private label\ncards and qualified colleagues\nrisk factors above and\n\u201cSupervision, Regulation and\nOther\u2014Competition\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISKS                                             \n                                                                \nA Failure or Disruption of\nCiti\u2019s Operational Processes\nor Systems Could Negatively\nImpact Its Reputation,\nCustomers, Clients, Businesses\nor Results of Operations and\nFinancial Condition.\n\nCiti\u2019s global operations rely\nheavily on its technology,\nincluding the accurate, timely\nand secure processing,\nmanagement, storage and\ntransmission of confidential\ntransactions, data and other\ninformation as well as the\nmonitoring of a substantial\namount of data and complex\ntransactions in real time.\nCiti obtains and stores an\nextensive amount of personal\nand client-specific\ninformation for its consumer\nand institutional customers\nand clients, and must\naccurately record and reflect\ntheir extensive account\ntransactions. Citi\u2019s\noperations must also comply\nwith complex and evolving laws\nand regulations in the\ncountries in which it\noperates. With the evolving\nproliferation of new\ntechnologies and the\nincreasing use of the\ninternet, mobile devices and\ncloud technologies to conduct\nfinancial transactions and\ncustomers\u2019 and clients\u2019\nincreasing use of online\nbanking and trading systems\nand other platforms, large\nglobal financial institutions\nsuch as Citi have been, and\nwill continue to be, subject\nto an ever-increasing risk of\noperational loss, failure or\ndisruption, including as a\nresult of cyber or information\n\nsecurity incidents (for\nadditional information, see\nthe cybersecurity risk factor\nbelow).\n\nAlthough Citi has continued to\nupgrade its technology,\nincluding systems to automate\nprocesses and enhance\nefficiencies, operational\nincidents are unpredictable\nand can arise from numerous\nsources, not all of which are\nfully within Citi\u2019s control.\nThese include, among others,\nhuman error, such as manual\ntransaction processing errors,\nwhich can be exacerbated by\nstaffing challenges and\nprocessing backlogs; fraud or\nmalice on the part of\nemployees or third parties;\noperational or execution\nfailures or deficiencies by\nthird parties; insufficient\n(or limited) straight-through\nprocessing between legacy\nsystems and any failure to\ndesign and effectively operate\ncontrols that mitigate\noperational risks associated\nwith those legacy systems\nleading to potential risk of\nerrors and operating losses;\naccidental system or\ntechnological failure;\nelectrical or\ntelecommunication outages;\nfailures of or cyber incidents\ninvolving computer servers or\ninfrastructure; or other\nsimilar losses or damage to\nCiti\u2019s property or assets (see\nalso the climate change risk\nfactor above).\n\nFor example, Citi has\nexperienced and could\nexperience further losses\nassociated with manual\ntransaction processing errors,\nincluding erroneous payments\nto lenders or manual errors by\nCiti traders that cause system\nand market disruptions and\nlosses for Citi and its\nclients. Irrespective of the\nsophistication of the\ntechnology utilized by Citi,\nthere will always be some room\nfor human error. In view of\nthe large transactions in\nwhich Citi engages, such\nerrors could result in\nsignificant losses. While Citi\nhas change management\nprocesses in place to\nappropriately upgrade its\noperational processes and\nsystems to ensure that any\nchanges introduced do not\nadversely impact security and\noperational continuity, such\nchange management can fail or\nbe ineffective. Operational\nincidents can also arise as a\nresult of failures by third\nparties with which Citi does\nbusiness, such as failures by\ninternet, mobile technology\nand cloud service providers or\nother vendors to adequately\nfollow procedures or\nprocesses, safeguard their\nsystems or prevent system\ndisruptions or cyberattacks.\n\nIncidents that impact\ninformation security and/or\ntechnology operations may\ncause disruptions and/or\nmalfunctions within Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses (e.g., the\ntemporary loss of availability\nof Citi\u2019s online banking\nsystem or mobile banking\nplatform), as well as the\noperations of its clients,\ncustomers or other third\nparties. In addition,\noperational incidents could\ninvolve the failure or\nineffectiveness of internal\nprocesses or controls. Given\nCiti\u2019s global footprint and\nthe high volume of\ntransactions processed by\nCiti, certain failures, errors\nor actions may be repeated or\ncompounded before they are\ndiscovered and rectified,\nwhich would further increase\nthe consequences and costs.\nOperational incidents could\nresult in financial losses as\nwell as misappropriation,\ncorruption or loss of\nconfidential and other\ninformation or assets, which\ncould significantly negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation,\ncustomers, clients, businesses\nor results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Cyber-\nrelated and other operational\nincidents can also result in\nlegal and regulatory actions\nor proceedings, fines and\nother costs (see the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below).\n                               47                               \nFor information on Citi\u2019s\nmanagement of operational\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s and Third Parties\u2019\nComputer Systems and Networks\nWill Continue to Be\nSusceptible to an Increasing\nRisk of Continually Evolving,\nSophisticated Cybersecurity\nIncidents That Could Result in\nthe Theft, Loss, Misuse or\nDisclosure of Confidential\nClient or Customer\nInformation, Damage to Citi\u2019s\nReputation, Additional Costs\nto Citi, Regulatory Penalties,\nLegal Exposure and Financial\nLosses.\n\nCiti\u2019s computer systems,\nsoftware and networks are\nsubject to ongoing cyber\nincidents, such as\nunauthorized access, loss or\ndestruction of data (including\nconfidential client\ninformation), account\ntakeovers, disruptions of\nservice, phishing, malware,\nransomware, computer viruses\nor other malicious code,\ncyberattacks and other similar\nevents. These threats can\narise from external parties,\nincluding cyber criminals,\ncyber terrorists, hacktivists\n(individuals or groups using\ncyberattacks to promote a\npolitical or social agenda)\nand nation-state actors, as\nwell as insiders who knowingly\nor unknowingly engage in or\nenable malicious cyber\nactivities.\n\nThe increasing use of mobile\nand other digital banking\nplatforms and services, cloud\ntechnologies and connectivity\nsolutions to facilitate remote\nworking for Citi\u2019s employees\nall increase Citi\u2019s exposure\nto cybersecurity risks. Citi\u2019s\nwind-down of its businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\n(for additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s exposures related\nto its Russia operations, see\nthe macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical risk factor above\nand \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d below).\n\nThird parties with which Citi\ndoes business, as well as\nretailers and other third\nparties with which Citi\u2019s\ncustomers do business, may\nalso be sources of\ncybersecurity risks,\nparticularly where activities\nof customers are beyond Citi\u2019s\nsecurity and control systems.\nFor example, Citi outsources\ncertain functions, such as\nprocessing customer credit\ncard transactions, uploading\ncontent on customer-facing\nwebsites and developing\nsoftware for new products and\nservices. These relationships\nallow for the storage and\nprocessing of customer\ninformation by third-party\nhosting of, or access to, Citi\nwebsites, which could lead to\ncompromise or the potential to\nintroduce vulnerable or\nmalicious code, resulting in\nsecurity breaches impacting\nCiti customers. Furthermore,\nbecause financial institutions\nare becoming increasingly\ninterconnected with central\nagents, exchanges and clearing\nhouses, including as a result\nof derivatives reforms over\nthe last few years, Citi has\nincreased exposure to\ncyberattacks through third\nparties. While many of Citi\u2019s\nagreements with third parties\ninclude indemnification\nprovisions, Citi may not be\nable to recover sufficiently,\nor at all, under these\nprovisions to adequately\noffset any losses Citi may\nincur from third-party cyber\nincidents.\n\nCiti and some of its third-\nparty partners have been\nsubject to attempted and\nsometimes successful\ncyberattacks from external\nsources over the last several\nyears, including (i) denial of\nservice attacks, which attempt\nto interrupt service to\nclients and customers; (ii)\nhacking and malicious software\ninstallations intended to gain\nunauthorized access to\ninformation systems or to\ndisrupt those systems; (iii)\ndata\n\nbreaches due to unauthorized\naccess to customer account\ndata; and (iv) malicious\nsoftware attacks on client\nsystems, in attempts to gain\nunauthorized access to Citi\nsystems or client data under\nthe guise of normal client\ntransactions. While Citi\u2019s\nmonitoring and protection\nservices were able to detect\nand respond to the incidents\ntargeting its systems before\nthey became significant, they\nstill resulted in limited\nlosses in some instances as\nwell as increases in\nexpenditures to monitor\nagainst the threat of similar\nfuture cyber incidents. There\ncan be no assurance that such\ncyber incidents will not occur\nagain, and they could occur\nmore frequently, via novel\ntactics and on a more\nsignificant scale.\n\nFurther, although Citi devotes\nsignificant resources to\nimplement, maintain, monitor\nand regularly upgrade its\nsystems and networks with\nmeasures such as intrusion\ndetection and prevention and\nfirewalls to safeguard\ncritical business\napplications, there is no\nguarantee that these measures\nor any other measures can\nprovide absolute security.\nBecause the techniques used to\ninitiate cyberattacks change\nfrequently or, in some cases,\nare not recognized until\nlaunched or even later, Citi\nmay be unable to implement\neffective preventive measures\nor otherwise proactively\naddress these methods. In\naddition, given the evolving\nnature of cyber threat actors\nand the frequency and\nsophistication of the cyber\nactivities they carry out, the\ndetermination of the severity\nand potential impact of a\ncyber incident may not become\napparent for a substantial\nperiod of time following\ndiscovery of the incident.\nAlso, while Citi engages in\ncertain actions to reduce the\nexposure resulting from\noutsourcing, such as\nperforming security control\nassessments of third-party\nvendors and limiting third-\nparty access to the least\nprivileged level necessary to\nperform job functions, these\nactions cannot prevent all\nthird-party-related\ncyberattacks or data breaches.\n\nCyber incidents can result in\nthe disclosure of personal,\nconfidential or proprietary\ncustomer, client or employee\ninformation, damage to Citi\u2019s\nreputation with its clients\nand the market, customer\ndissatisfaction and additional\ncosts to Citi, including\nexpenses such as repairing\nsystems, replacing customer\npayment cards, credit\nmonitoring or adding new\npersonnel or protection\ntechnologies. Cyber incidents\ncan also result in regulatory\npenalties, loss of revenues,\nexposure to litigation and\nother financial losses,\nincluding loss of funds, to\nboth Citi and its clients and\ncustomers and disruption to\nCiti\u2019s operational systems\n(for additional information on\nthe potential impact of\noperational disruptions, see\nthe operational processes and\nsystems risk factor above).\nMoreover, the increasing risk\nof cyber incidents has\nresulted in increased\nlegislative and regulatory\nscrutiny of firms\u2019\ncybersecurity protection\nservices and calls for\nadditional laws and\nregulations to further enhance\nprotection of consumers\u2019\npersonal data.\n\nWhile Citi maintains insurance\ncoverage that may, subject to\npolicy terms and conditions\nincluding significant self-\ninsured deductibles, cover\ncertain aspects of cyber\nrisks, such insurance coverage\nmay be insufficient to cover\nall losses and may not take\ninto account reputational\nharm, the costs of which are\nimpossible to quantify.\n\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s management of\ncybersecurity risk, see\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Operational\nRisk\u2014Cybersecurity Risk\u201d\nbelow.\n                               48                               \nChanges or Errors in\nAccounting Assumptions,\nJudgments or Estimates, or the\nApplication of Certain\nAccounting Principles, Could\nResult in Significant Losses\nor Other Adverse Impacts.\n\nU.S. GAAP requires Citi to use\ncertain assumptions, judgments\nand estimates in preparing its\nfinancial statements,\nincluding, among other items,\nthe estimate of the ACL;\nreserves related to\nlitigation, regulatory and tax\nmatters; valuation of DTAs;\nthe fair values of certain\nassets and liabilities; and\nthe assessment of goodwill and\nother assets for impairment.\nThese assumptions, judgments\nand estimates are inherently\nlimited because they involve\ntechniques, including the use\nof historical data in many\ncircumstances, that cannot\nanticipate every economic and\nfinancial outcome in the\nmarkets in which Citi\noperates, nor can they\nanticipate the specifics and\ntiming of such outcomes. For\nexample, many models used by\nCiti include assumptions about\ncorrelation or lack thereof\namong prices of various asset\nclasses or other market\nindicators that may not hold\nin times of market stress,\nlimited liquidity or other\nunforeseen circumstances. If\nCiti\u2019s assumptions, judgments\nor estimates underlying its\nfinancial statements are\nincorrect or differ from\nactual or subsequent events,\nCiti could experience\nunexpected losses or other\nadverse impacts, some of which\ncould be significant. Citi\ncould also experience declines\nin its stock price, be subject\nto legal and regulatory\nproceedings and incur fines\nand other losses. For\nadditional information on the\nkey areas for which\nassumptions and estimates are\nused in preparing Citi\u2019s\nfinancial statements, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below and Notes 1\nand 15.\n\nFor example, the CECL\nmethodology requires that Citi\nprovide reserves for a current\nestimate of lifetime expected\ncredit losses for its loan\nportfolios and other financial\nassets, as applicable, at the\ntime those assets are\noriginated or acquired. This\nestimate is adjusted each\nperiod for changes in expected\nlifetime credit losses. Citi\u2019s\nACL estimate depends upon its\nCECL models and assumptions;\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions, including, among\nother things, the U.S.\nunemployment rate and U.S.\ninflation-adjusted gross\ndomestic product (real GDP);\nand the credit indicators,\ncomposition and other\ncharacteristics of Citi\u2019s loan\nportfolios and other\napplicable financial assets.\nThese model assumptions and\nforecasted macroeconomic\nconditions will change over\ntime, resulting in variability\nin Citi\u2019s ACL, and, thus,\nimpact its results of\noperations and financial\ncondition, as well as\nregulatory capital due to the\nCECL phase-in (for additional\ninformation on the CECL phase-\nin, see the capital return\nrisk factor above).\n\nMoreover, Citi has incurred\nlosses related to its foreign\noperations that are reported\nin the CTA components of\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) . In accordance with\nU.S. GAAP, a sale, substantial\nliquidation or other\ndeconsolidation event of any\nforeign operations, such as\nthose related to Citi\u2019s\nremaining divestitures or\nlegacy businesses, would\nresult in reclassification of\nany foreign CTA component of\nAOCI related to that foreign\noperation, including related\nhedges and taxes, into Citi\u2019s\nearnings. For example, in the\nsecond quarter of 2022, Citi\nincurred a CTA loss (net of\nhedges) in AOCI released to\nearnings of approximately $400\nmillion ($345 million after-\ntax) related to\n\nthe substantial liquidation of\na legacy U.K. consumer\noperation (for additional\ninformation, see \u201c Legacy\nFranchises \u201d and \u201c\nCorporate/Other \u201d above and\nNote 2). For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\naccounting policy for foreign\ncurrency translation and its\nforeign CTA components of AOCI\n, see Notes 1 and 20.\n\nChanges to Financial\nAccounting and Reporting\nStandards or Interpretations\nCould Have a Material Impact\non How Citi Records and\nReports Its Financial\nCondition and Results of\nOperations.\n\nPeriodically, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board\n(FASB) issues financial\naccounting and reporting\nstandards that govern key\naspects of Citi\u2019s financial\nstatements or interpretations\nthereof when those standards\nbecome effective, including\nthose areas where Citi is\nrequired to make assumptions\nor estimates. Changes to\nfinancial accounting or\nreporting standards or\ninterpretations, whether\npromulgated or required by the\nFASB, the SEC, banking\nregulators or others, could\npresent operational challenges\nand could also require Citi to\nchange certain of the\nassumptions or estimates it\npreviously used in preparing\nits financial statements,\nwhich could negatively impact\nhow it records and reports its\nfinancial condition and\nresults of operations\ngenerally and/or with respect\nto particular businesses. See\nNote 1 for additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\naccounting policies and\nchanges in accounting,\nincluding the expected impacts\non Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition.\n\nIf Citi\u2019s Risk Management\nProcesses, Strategies or\nModels Are Deficient or\nIneffective, Citi May Incur\nSignificant Losses and Its\nRegulatory Capital and Capital\nRatios Could Be Negatively\nImpacted.\n\nCiti utilizes a broad and\ndiversified set of risk\nmanagement and mitigation\nprocesses and strategies,\nincluding the use of models in\nenacting processes and\nstrategies as well as in\nanalyzing and monitoring the\nvarious risks Citi assumes in\nconducting its activities. For\nexample, Citi uses models as\npart of its comprehensive\nstress testing initiatives\nacross the Company. Citi also\nrelies on data to aggregate,\nassess and manage various risk\nexposures. Management of these\nrisks is made more challenging\nwithin a global financial\ninstitution such as Citi,\nparticularly given the\ncomplex, diverse and rapidly\nchanging financial markets and\nconditions in which Citi\noperates as well as that\nlosses can occur\nunintentionally from untimely,\ninaccurate or incomplete\nprocesses and data. As\ndiscussed below, in October\n2020, Citigroup and Citibank\nentered into consent orders\nwith the FRB and OCC that\nrequire Citigroup and Citibank\nto make improvements in\nvarious aspects of enterprise-\nwide risk management,\ncompliance, data quality\nmanagement and governance and\ninternal controls (see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d\nabove and the legal and\nregulatory proceedings risk\nfactor below).\n\nCiti\u2019s risk management\nprocesses, strategies and\nmodels are inherently limited\nbecause they involve\ntechniques, including the use\nof historical data in many\ncircumstances, assumptions and\njudgments that cannot\nanticipate every economic and\nfinancial outcome in the\nmarkets in which Citi\noperates, nor can they\nanticipate the specifics and\ntiming of\n                               49                               \nsuch outcomes. For example,\nmany models used by Citi\ninclude assumptions about\ncorrelation or lack thereof\namong prices of various asset\nclasses or other market\nindicators that may not\nnecessarily hold in times of\nmarket stress, limited\nliquidity or other unforeseen\ncircumstances. Citi could\nincur significant losses, and\nits regulatory capital and\ncapital ratios could be\nnegatively impacted, if Citi\u2019s\nrisk management processes,\nincluding its ability to\nmanage and aggregate data in a\ntimely and accurate manner,\nstrategies or models are\ndeficient or ineffective. Such\ndeficiencies or\nineffectiveness could also\nresult in inaccurate\nfinancial, regulatory or risk\nreporting.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s Basel III\nregulatory capital models,\nincluding its credit, market\nand operational risk models,\ncurrently remain subject to\nongoing regulatory review and\napproval, which may result in\nrefinements, modifications or\nenhancements (required or\notherwise) to these models.\nCiti is required to notify and\nobtain preapproval from both\nthe OCC and FRB prior to\nimplementing certain risk-\nweighted asset treatments, as\nwell as certain model changes,\nresulting in a more\nchallenging environment within\nwhich Citi must operate in\nmanaging its risk-weighted\nassets. Modifications or\nrequirements resulting from\nthese ongoing reviews, as well\nas any future changes or\nguidance provided by the U.S.\nbanking agencies regarding the\nregulatory capital framework\napplicable to Citi, have\nresulted in, and could\ncontinue to result in,\nsignificant changes to Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets. These\nchanges can negatively impact\nCiti\u2019s capital ratios and its\nability to achieve its\nregulatory capital\nrequirements.\n                                                                \n  CREDIT RISKS                                                  \n                                                                \nCredit Risk and Concentrations\nof Risk Can Increase the\nPotential for Citi to Incur\nSignificant Losses.\n\nCiti has credit exposures to\nconsumer, corporate and public\nsector borrowers and other\ncounterparties in the U.S. and\nvarious countries and\njurisdictions globally,\nincluding end-of-period\nconsumer loans of $368 billion\nand end-of-period corporate\nloans of $289 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s corporate and consumer\nloan portfolios, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Corporate Credit\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d below.\n\nA default by a borrower or\nother counterparty, or a\ndecline in the credit quality\nor value of any underlying\ncollateral, exposes Citi to\ncredit risk. Despite Citi\u2019s\ntarget client strategy,\nvarious macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nfactors, among other things,\ncan increase Citi\u2019s credit\nrisk and credit costs,\nparticularly for certain\nsectors, industries or\ncountries (for additional\ninformation, see the co-\nbranding and private label\ncredit card and macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties\nrisk factors above and the\nemerging markets risk factor\nbelow). For example, a\nweakening of economic\nconditions can adversely\naffect borrowers\u2019 ability to\nrepay their obligations, as\nwell as result in Citi being\nunable to liquidate the\ncollateral it holds or forced\nto liquidate the collateral at\nprices that do not cover the\nfull amount owed to Citi. Citi\nis also a member of various\ncentral clearing\ncounterparties and could incur\nfinancial losses as a result\nof defaults by other clearing\nmembers due to the\nrequirements of clearing\nmembers to share losses.\nAdditionally, due to the\n\ninterconnectedness among\nfinancial institutions,\nconcerns about the\ncreditworthiness of or\ndefaults by a financial\ninstitution could spread to\nother financial market\nparticipants and result in\nmarket-wide losses.\n\nWhile Citi provides reserves\nfor expected losses for its\ncredit exposures, as\napplicable, such reserves are\nsubject to judgments and\nestimates that could be\nincorrect or differ from\nactual future events. Under\nthe CECL accounting standard,\nthe ACL reflects expected\nlosses, which has resulted in\nand could lead to additional\nvolatility in the allowance\nand the provision for credit\nlosses as forecasts of\neconomic conditions change.\nFor additional information,\nsee the incorrect assumptions\nor estimates and changes to\nfinancial accounting and\nreporting standards risk\nfactors above. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below and Notes 1\nand 15. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s credit\nand country risk, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations above and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u201d and \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country Risk\u201d\nbelow and Notes 14 and 15.\n\nConcentrations of risk to\nclients or counterparties\nengaged in the same or related\nindustries or doing business\nin a particular geography,\nespecially credit and market\nrisks, can also increase\nCiti\u2019s risk of significant\nlosses. For example, Citi\nroutinely executes a high\nvolume of securities, trading,\nderivative and foreign\nexchange transactions with\nnon-U.S. sovereigns and with\ncounterparties in the\nfinancial services industry,\nincluding banks, insurance\ncompanies, investment banks,\ngovernments, central banks and\nother financial institutions.\nMoreover, Citi has\nindemnification obligations in\nconnection with various\ntransactions that expose it to\nconcentrations of risk,\nincluding credit risk from\nhedging or reinsurance\narrangements related to those\nobligations (for additional\ninformation about these\nexposures, see Note 27). A\nrapid deterioration of a large\nborrower or other counterparty\nor within a sector or country\nin which Citi has large\nexposures or indemnifications\nor unexpected market\ndislocations could lead to\nconcerns about the\ncreditworthiness of other\nborrowers or counterparties in\nrelated or dependent\nindustries, and such\nconditions could cause Citi to\nincur significant losses.\n                                                                \n  LIQUIDITY RISKS                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Businesses, Results of\nOperations and Financial\nCondition Could Be Negatively\nImpacted if It Does Not\nEffectively Manage Its\nLiquidity.\n\nAs a large, global financial\ninstitution, adequate\nliquidity and sources of\nfunding are essential to\nCiti\u2019s businesses. Citi\u2019s\nliquidity and sources of\nfunding can be significantly\nand negatively impacted by\nfactors it cannot control,\nsuch as general disruptions in\nthe financial markets,\ngovernmental fiscal and\nmonetary policies, regulatory\nchanges or negative investor\nperceptions of Citi\u2019s\ncreditworthiness, unexpected\nincreases in cash or\ncollateral requirements and\nthe consequent inability to\nmonetize available liquidity\nresources. Citi competes with\nother banks and financial\ninstitutions for both\ninstitutional and consumer\ndeposits, which represent\nCiti\u2019s most stable and lowest\ncost source of long-term\nfunding. The competition for\ndeposits has continued to\nincrease in recent\n                               50                               \nyears, including as a result\nof online banks and digital\nbanking and fixed income\nalternatives for customer\nfunds. Furthermore, it is\nexpected that the market for\ndeposits will become more\ncompetitive in the current\nhigher interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nCiti\u2019s costs to obtain and\naccess wholesale funding are\ndirectly related to changes in\ninterest and currency exchange\nrates and its credit spreads.\nFor example, during 2022,\ninterest rates in the U.S.\nincreased significantly, thus,\naffecting Citi\u2019s cost of\nfunding. Changes in Citi\u2019s\ncredit spreads are driven by\nboth external market factors\nand factors specific to Citi,\nsuch as negative views by\ninvestors of the financial\nservices industry or Citi\u2019s\nfinancial prospects, and can\nbe highly volatile. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s primary sources of\nfunding, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n\nCiti\u2019s ability to obtain\nfunding may be impaired and\nits cost of funding could also\nincrease if other market\nparticipants are seeking to\naccess the markets at the same\ntime or to a greater extent\nthan expected, or if market\nappetite for corporate debt\nsecurities declines, as is\nlikely to occur in a liquidity\nstress event or other market\ncrisis. Citi\u2019s ability to sell\nassets may also be impaired if\nother market participants are\nseeking to sell similar assets\nat the same time or a liquid\nmarket does not exist for such\nassets. A sudden drop in\nmarket liquidity could also\ncause a temporary or\nprotracted dislocation of\nunderwriting and capital\nmarkets activity. In addition,\nclearing organizations,\ncentral banks, clients and\nfinancial institutions with\nwhich Citi interacts may\nexercise the right to require\nadditional collateral during\nchallenging market conditions,\nwhich could further impair\nCiti\u2019s liquidity. If Citi\nfails to effectively manage\nits liquidity, its businesses,\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition could be\nnegatively impacted.\n\nIn addition, as a holding\ncompany, Citigroup Inc. relies\non interest, dividends,\ndistributions and other\npayments from its subsidiaries\nto fund dividends as well as\nto satisfy its debt and other\nobligations. Several of Citi\u2019s\nU.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries\nare or may be subject to\ncapital adequacy or other\nliquidity, regulatory or\ncontractual restrictions on\ntheir ability to provide such\npayments, including any local\nregulatory stress test\nrequirements and inter-\naffiliate arrangements entered\ninto in connection with\nCitigroup Inc.\u2019s resolution\nplan. Citigroup Inc.\u2019s broker-\ndealer and bank subsidiaries\nare subject to restrictions on\ntheir ability to lend or\ntransact with affiliates, as\nwell as restrictions on their\nability to use funds deposited\nwith them in brokerage or bank\naccounts to fund their\nbusinesses. Limitations on the\npayments that Citigroup Inc.\nreceives from its subsidiaries\ncould also impact its\nliquidity. A bank holding\ncompany is required by law to\nact as a source of financial\nand managerial strength for\nits subsidiary banks. As a\nresult, the FRB may require\nCitigroup Inc. to commit\nresources to its subsidiary\nbanks even if doing so is not\notherwise in the interests of\nCitigroup Inc. or its\nshareholders or creditors,\nreducing the amount of funds\navailable to meet its\nobligations.\n\nCredit Rating Agencies\nContinuously Review the Credit\nRatings of Citi and Certain of\nIts Subsidiaries, and a\nRatings Downgrade Could\nAdversely Impact Citi\u2019s\nFunding and Liquidity.\n\nThe credit rating agencies,\nsuch as Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Services and S&P\nGlobal Ratings, continuously\nevaluate Citi and certain of\nits subsidiaries. Their\nratings of Citi and its rated\nsubsidiaries\u2019 long-term debt\nand short-term obligations are\nbased on several factors,\nincluding the financial\nstrength of Citi and such\nsubsidiaries, as well as\nfactors that are not entirely\nwithin the control of Citi and\nits subsidiaries, such as the\nagencies\u2019 proprietary rating\nmethodologies and assumptions,\nand conditions affecting the\nfinancial services industry\nand markets generally.\n\nCiti and its subsidiaries may\nnot be able to maintain their\ncurrent respective ratings and\noutlooks. Rating downgrades\ncould negatively impact Citi\nand its rated subsidiaries\u2019\nability to access the capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds as well as the costs of\nthose funds. A ratings\ndowngrade could also have a\nnegative impact on Citi and\nits rated subsidiaries\u2019\nability to obtain funding and\nliquidity due to reduced\nfunding capacity and the\nimpact from derivative\ntriggers, which could require\nCiti and its rated\nsubsidiaries to meet cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements. In addition, a\nratings downgrade could have a\nnegative impact on other\nfunding sources such as\nsecured financing and other\nmargined transactions for\nwhich there may be no explicit\ntriggers, and on contractual\nprovisions and other credit\nrequirements of Citi\u2019s\ncounterparties and clients\nthat may contain minimum\nratings thresholds in order\nfor Citi to hold third-party\nfunds.\n\nFurthermore, a credit ratings\ndowngrade could have impacts\nthat may not be currently\nknown to Citi or are not\npossible to quantify. Some of\nCiti\u2019s counterparties and\nclients could have ratings\nlimitations on their\npermissible counterparties, of\nwhich Citi may or may not be\naware. Certain of Citi\u2019s\ncorporate customers and\ntrading counterparties, among\nother clients, could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit the trading of certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi in\nresponse to ratings\ndowngrades. Changes in\ncustomer and counterparty\nbehavior could impact not only\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nbut also the results of\noperations of certain Citi\nbusinesses. For additional\ninformation on the potential\nimpact of a reduction in\nCiti\u2019s or Citibank\u2019s credit\nratings, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISKS                                              \n                                                                \nOngoing Interpretation and\nImplementation of Regulatory\nand Legislative Requirements\nand Changes and Heightened\nRegulatory Scrutiny and\nExpectations in the U.S. and\nGlobally Have Increased Citi\u2019s\nCompliance, Regulatory and\nOther Risks and Costs.\n\nCiti is continually required\nto interpret and implement\nextensive and frequently\nchanging regulatory and\nlegislative requirements in\nthe U.S. and other\njurisdictions in which it does\nbusiness, which may overlap or\nconflict across jurisdictions,\nresulting in substantial\ncompliance, regulatory and\nother risks and costs. In\naddition, there are heightened\nregulatory scrutiny and\nexpectations in the U.S. and\nglobally\n                               51                               \nfor large financial\ninstitutions, as well as their\nemployees and agents, with\nrespect to governance,\ninfrastructure, data, climate\nand risk management practices\nand controls. These\nrequirements and expectations\nalso include, among other\nthings, those related to\ncustomer and client\nprotection, market practices,\nanti-money laundering and\nincreasingly complex sanctions\nand disclosure regimes. A\nfailure to comply with these\nrequirements and expectations,\neven if inadvertent, or\nresolve any identified\ndeficiencies, could result in\nincreased regulatory oversight\nand restrictions, enforcement\nproceedings, penalties and\nfines (for additional\ninformation on such regulatory\nconsequences, see the legal\nand regulatory proceedings\nrisk factor below).\n\nOver the past several years,\nCiti has been required to\nimplement a significant number\nof regulatory and legislative\nchanges, including new\nregulatory or legislative\nrequirements or regimes,\nacross its businesses and\nfunctions, and these changes\ncontinue. The changes\nthemselves may be complex and\nsubject to interpretation, and\nwill require continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s global\noperations and technology\nsolutions. In some cases,\nCiti\u2019s implementation of a\nregulatory or legislative\nrequirement is occurring\nsimultaneously with changing\nor conflicting regulatory\nguidance, legal challenges or\nlegislative action to modify\nor repeal existing rules or\nenact new rules. Examples of\nregulatory or legislative\nchanges that have resulted in\nincreased compliance risks and\ncosts include (i) various laws\nrelating to the limitation of\ncross-border data movement\nand/or collection and use of\ncustomer information,\nincluding data localization\nand protection and privacy\nlaws, which also can conflict\nwith or increase compliance\ncomplexity with respect to\nother laws, including anti-\nmoney laundering laws; and\n(ii) the U.S. banking\nagencies\u2019 regulatory capital\nrules and requirements, which\nhave continued to evolve (for\nadditional information, see\nthe capital return risk factor\nand \u201cCapital Resources\u201d\nabove). In addition, certain\nU.S. regulatory agencies and\nnon-U.S. authorities have\nprioritized issues of social,\neconomic and racial justice,\nand are in the process of\nconsidering ways in which\nthese issues can be mitigated,\nincluding through rulemaking,\nsupervision and other means,\neven while Congress is\nsignaling, and certain U.S.\nstate governments are pursuing\npotentially conflicting anti-\nESG priorities.\n\nCiti Is Subject to Extensive\nLegal and Regulatory\nProceedings, Examinations,\nInvestigations, Consent Orders\nand Related Compliance Efforts\nand Other Inquiries That Could\nResult in Significant Monetary\nPenalties, Supervisory or\nEnforcement Orders, Business\nRestrictions, Limitations on\nDividends, Changes to\nDirectors and/or Officers and\nCollateral Consequences\nArising from Such Outcomes.\n\nAt any given time, Citi is a\nparty to a significant number\nof legal and regulatory\nproceedings and is subject to\nnumerous governmental and\nregulatory examinations.\nAdditionally, Citi remains\nsubject to governmental and\nregulatory investigations,\nconsent orders and related\ncompliance efforts, and other\ninquiries. Citi could also be\nsubject to enforcement\nproceedings not only because\nof violations of laws and\nregulations, but also due to\nfailures, as determined by its\nregulators, to have adequate\npolicies and procedures, or to\nremedy deficiencies on a\ntimely basis.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nOctober 2020 FRB and OCC\nconsent orders require\nCitigroup and Citibank to\nimplement targeted action\nplans and submit quarterly\nprogress reports detailing the\nresults and status of\nimprovements relating\nprincipally to various aspects\nof enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement, compliance, data\nquality management and\ngovernance and internal\ncontrols. These improvements\nwill result in continued\nsignificant investments by\nCiti during 2023 and beyond,\nas an essential part of Citi\u2019s\nbroader transformation efforts\nto enhance its risk, controls,\ndata and finance\ninfrastructure and compliance.\n\nAlthough there are no\nrestrictions on Citi\u2019s ability\nto serve its clients, the OCC\nconsent order requires\nCitibank to obtain prior\napproval of any significant\nnew acquisition, including any\nportfolio or business\nacquisition, excluding\nordinary course transactions.\nMoreover, the OCC consent\norder provides that the OCC\nhas the right to assess future\ncivil money penalties or take\nother supervisory and/or\nenforcement actions. Such\nactions by the OCC could\ninclude imposing business\nrestrictions, including\npossible limitations on the\ndeclaration or payment of\ndividends and changes in\ndirectors and/or senior\nexecutive officers. More\ngenerally, the OCC and/or the\nFRB could take additional\nenforcement or other actions\nif the regulatory agency\nbelieves that Citi has not met\nregulatory expectations\nregarding compliance with the\nconsent orders. For additional\ninformation regarding the\nconsent orders, see \u201cCiti\u2019s\nConsent Order Compliance\u201d\nabove.\n\nThe global judicial,\nregulatory and political\nenvironment has generally been\nchallenging for large\nfinancial institutions, and\nfinancial institutions have\nbeen subject to continued\nregulatory scrutiny. The\ncomplexity of the federal and\nstate regulatory and\nenforcement regimes in the\nU.S., coupled with the global\nscope of Citi\u2019s operations,\nalso means that a single event\nor issue may give rise to a\nlarge number of overlapping\ninvestigations and regulatory\nproceedings, either by\nmultiple federal and state\nagencies and authorities in\nthe U.S. or by multiple\nregulators and other\ngovernmental entities in\nforeign jurisdictions, as well\nas multiple civil litigation\nclaims in multiple\njurisdictions. Violations of\nlaw by other financial\ninstitutions may also result\nin regulatory scrutiny of\nCiti. Responding to regulatory\ninquiries and proceedings can\nbe time consuming and costly.\n\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators\nhave been increasingly focused\non the culture of financial\nservices firms, including\nCiti, as well as \u201cconduct\nrisk,\u201d a term used to describe\nthe risks associated with\nbehavior by employees and\nagents, including third\nparties, that could harm\nclients, customers, employees\nor the integrity of the\nmarkets, such as improperly\ncreating, selling, marketing\nor managing products and\nservices or improper incentive\ncompensation programs with\nrespect thereto, failures to\nsafeguard a party\u2019s personal\ninformation, or failures to\nidentify and manage conflicts\nof interest.\n\nIn addition to the greater\nfocus on conduct risk, the\ngeneral heightened scrutiny\nand expectations from\nregulators could lead to\ninvestigations and other\ninquiries, as well as\nremediation requirements, more\nregulatory or other\nenforcement proceedings, civil\nlitigation and higher\ncompliance and other risks and\ncosts. Further, while Citi\ntakes numerous steps to\nprevent and detect conduct by\nemployees and agents that\ncould potentially harm\nclients, customers,\n                               52                               \nemployees or the integrity of\nthe markets, such behavior may\nnot always be deterred or\nprevented. In addition to\nregulatory restrictions or\nstructural changes that could\nresult from perceived\ndeficiencies in Citi\u2019s\nculture, such focus could also\nlead to additional regulatory\nproceedings. Moreover, the\nseverity of the remedies\nsought in legal and regulatory\nproceedings to which Citi is\nsubject has remained elevated.\nU.S. and certain non-U.S.\ngovernmental entities have\nincreasingly brought criminal\nactions against, or have\nsought criminal convictions\nfrom, financial institutions\nand individual employees, and\ncriminal prosecutors in the\nU.S. have increasingly sought\nand obtained criminal guilty\npleas or deferred prosecution\nagreements against financial\nentities and individuals and\nother criminal sanctions for\nthose institutions and\nindividuals. These types of\nactions by U.S. and\ninternational governmental\nentities may, in the future,\nhave significant collateral\nconsequences for a financial\ninstitution, including loss of\ncustomers and business, and\nthe inability to offer certain\nproducts or services and/or\noperate certain businesses.\nCiti may be required to accept\nor be subject to similar types\nof criminal remedies, consent\norders, sanctions, substantial\nfines and penalties,\nremediation and other\nfinancial costs or other\nrequirements in the future,\nincluding for matters or\npractices not yet known to\nCiti, any of which could\nmaterially and negatively\naffect Citi\u2019s businesses,\nbusiness practices, financial\ncondition or results of\noperations, require material\nchanges in Citi\u2019s operations\nor cause Citi reputational\nharm.\n\nAdditionally, many large\nclaims\u2014both private civil and\nregulatory\u2014asserted against\nCiti are highly complex, slow\nto develop and may involve\nnovel or untested legal\ntheories. The outcome of such\nproceedings is difficult to\npredict or estimate until late\nin the proceedings. Although\nCiti establishes accruals for\nits legal and regulatory\nmatters according to\naccounting requirements,\nCiti\u2019s estimates of, and\nchanges to, these accruals\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty, and\nthe amount of loss ultimately\nincurred in relation to those\nmatters may be substantially\nhigher than the amounts\naccrued (see the incorrect\nassumptions or estimates risk\nfactor above). In addition,\ncertain settlements are\nsubject to court approval and\nmay not be approved. For\nfurther information on Citi\u2019s\nlegal and regulatory\nproceedings, see Note 29.\n                                                                \n  OTHER RISKS                                                   \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Emerging Markets\nPresence Subjects It to\nVarious Risks as well as\nIncreased Compliance and\nRegulatory Risks and Costs.\n\nDuring 2022, emerging markets\nrevenues accounted for\napproximately 37% of Citi\u2019s\ntotal revenues (Citi generally\ndefines emerging markets as\ncountries in Latin America,\nAsia (other than Japan,\nAustralia and New Zealand),\nand central and Eastern\nEurope, the Middle East and\nAfrica in EMEA). Citi\u2019s\npresence in the emerging\nmarkets subjects it to various\nrisks, such as limitations or\nunavailability of hedges on\nforeign investments; foreign\ncurrency volatility, including\ndevaluations and continued\nstrength in the U.S. dollar;\nsustained increases in\ninterest rates; sovereign debt\nvolatility; election outcomes,\nregulatory changes and\npolitical events;\n\nforeign exchange controls,\nincluding inability to access\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms; macroeconomic and\ngeopolitical challenges and\nuncertainties and volatility,\nincluding with respect to\nRussia and China (see the\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical\nrisk factor above and\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d and\n\u201c\u2014Ukraine\u201d below); limitations\non foreign investment;\nsociopolitical instability\n(including from\nhyperinflation); fraud;\nnationalization or loss of\nlicenses; restrictions arising\nfrom retaliatory Russian laws\nand regulations on the conduct\nof its business; sanctions or\nasset freezes; potential\ncriminal charges; closure of\nbranches or subsidiaries; and\nconfiscation of assets, and\nthese risks can be exacerbated\nin the event of a\ndeterioration in relationships\nbetween the U.S. and an\nemerging market country.\n\nFor example, Citi operates in\nseveral countries that have,\nor have had in the past,\nstrict capital controls,\ncurrency controls and/or\nsanctions, such as Argentina\nand Russia, that limit its\nability to convert local\ncurrency into U.S. dollars\nand/or transfer funds outside\nof those countries. For\ninstance, due to currency\ncontrols in Argentina, Citi\nfaces a risk of devaluation on\nits unhedged Argentine peso-\ndenominated assets, which\ncontinue to increase (for\nadditional information on\nArgentina-related risks, see\n\u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Other\nRisks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nbelow). Moreover, if the\neconomic situation in a\ncountry in which Citi operates\nwere to deteriorate below a\ncertain level, U.S. regulators\nthrough the Interagency\nCountry Exposure Review\nCommittee (ICERC) may impose\nmandatory loan loss or other\nreserve requirements on Citi,\nwhich would increase its\ncredit costs and decrease its\nearnings.\n\nIn addition, political turmoil\nand instability and\ngeopolitical tensions and\nconflicts (such as the\nRussia\u2013Ukraine war) have\noccurred in various regions\nand emerging market countries\nacross the globe which have\nrequired, and may continue to\nrequire, management time and\nattention and other resources,\nsuch as monitoring the impact\nof sanctions on certain\nemerging market economies as\nwell as impacting Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\nconditions in affected\ncountries.\n\nThe Transition Away from and\nDiscontinuance of LIBOR or Any\nOther Interest Rate Benchmark\nCould Have Adverse\nConsequences for Citi.\n\nLIBOR and other rates or\nindices deemed to be\nbenchmarks have been the\nsubject of ongoing U.S. and\nnon-U.S. regulatory scrutiny\nand reform. The LIBOR\nadministrator ceased\npublication of non-USD LIBOR\nand one-week and two-month USD\nLIBOR on a permanent or\nrepresentative basis on\nDecember 31, 2021, with plans\nfor all other USD LIBOR tenors\nto permanently cease or become\nnon-representative after June\n30, 2023. As a result, Citi\nceased entering into new\ncontracts referencing USD\nLIBOR as of January 1, 2022,\nother than for limited\ncircumstances where regulators\nrecognized that it may be\nappropriate for banks to enter\ninto new USD LIBOR contracts,\nincluding with respect to\nmarket-making, hedging or\nnovations of USD transactions\nexecuted before January 1,\n2022.\n\nThrough a global effort by the\nfinancial services industry\nand regulators, alternative\nreference rates have been\nidentified\n                               53                               \nand/or developed and are being\nused to replace LIBOR and\nother benchmark rates.\nAlternative reference rates,\nsuch as the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR), are\ncalculated using components\ndifferent from those used in\nthe calculation of LIBOR and\nmay fluctuate differently\nthan, and not be\nrepresentative of, LIBOR. In\norder to compensate for these\ndifferences, certain of Citi\u2019s\nfinancial instruments and\ncommercial agreements allow\nfor a benchmark replacement\nadjustment. However, there can\nbe no assurance that any\nbenchmark replacement\nadjustment will be sufficient\nto produce the economic\nequivalent of LIBOR, either at\nthe benchmark replacement date\nor over the life of such\ninstruments and agreements.\n\nMoreover, the transition\npresents challenges related to\ncontractual mechanics of\nexisting contracts that\nreference USD LIBOR and are\ngoverned by non-U.S. law or\nreference the USD LIBOR Ice\nSwap Rate. Certain of these\nlegacy instruments and\ncontracts are not covered by\nany legislative solution and\ndo not provide for fallbacks\nto alternative reference\nrates, which makes it unclear\nwhat the applicable future\nreplacement benchmark rates\nand associated payments might\nbe after the current\nbenchmark\u2019s cessation. Citi\nmay be unable to amend certain\ninstruments and contracts due\nto an inability to obtain\nsufficient levels of consent\nfrom counterparties or\nsecurity holders. Although\nthis will depend on the\nprecise contractual terms of\nthe instrument, such consent\nrequirements are often\nconditions of securities, such\nas floating rate notes. The\nFinancial Conduct Authority\n(FCA), a U.K. regulator, has\nproposed that one-, three- and\nsix-month USD LIBOR be\npublished on a synthetic\nbasis, which would only be\navailable through September\n2024.\n\nIn addition, the transition\naway from and discontinuance\nof LIBOR and other benchmark\nrates have subjected financial\ninstitutions, including Citi,\nto heightened scrutiny from\nregulators. Failure to\nsuccessfully transition away\nfrom LIBOR and other benchmark\nrates could result in adverse\nregulatory actions, disputes,\nincluding potential litigation\ninvolving holders of\noutstanding products and\ncontracts that reference LIBOR\nand other benchmark rates, and\nreputational harm to Citi.

This\nsection summarizes some of\nCiti\u2019s key ESG initiatives,\nincluding its Sustainable\nProgress Strategy, Net Zero,\nand Financial Inclusion and\nRacial Equity commitments.\n\nCiti\u2019s ESG Report provides\ninformation on a broad set of\nESG-related efforts. Citi\u2019s\nTask Force on Climate-Related\nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD)\nReport provides its\nstakeholders with information\non Citi\u2019s continued progress\nto manage\n\nclimate risk and its Net Zero\nplan, including information on\nfinanced emissions and 2030\nemissions targets.\n\nFor information regarding\nCiti\u2019s management of climate\nrisk, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Strategic Risks\u2014Climate\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  ESG and Climate-Related Governance                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors\n(Board) provides oversight of\nCiti\u2019s management activities\n(for additional information,\nsee \u201cManaging Global Risk\u2014Risk\nGovernance\u201d below). For\nexample, the Nomination,\nGovernance and Public Affairs\nCommittee of the Board\noversees many of Citi\u2019s ESG\nactivities, including\nreviewing Citi\u2019s policies and\nprograms for environmental and\nsocial sustainability, climate\nchange, human rights,\ndiversity and other ESG\nissues, as well as overseeing\nengagement with external\nstakeholders.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee\nof the Board provides\noversight of Citi\u2019s\nIndependent Risk Management\nfunction and reviews Citi\u2019s\nrisk policies and frameworks,\nincluding receiving climate\nrisk-related updates.\n\nThe Audit Committee of the\nBoard has recently been\nchartered to provide oversight\nof controls and procedures\npertaining to the ESG-related\nmetrics and related\ndisclosures in Citi\u2019s SEC\nfiled reports and voluntary\nESG reporting, as well as\nmanagement\u2019s evaluation of\nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures for ESG reporting.\n\nCiti\u2019s Global ESG Council\nconsists of senior members of\nits management team and\ncertain subject matter experts\nwho provide oversight of\nCiti\u2019s ESG goals and\nactivities. In addition, a\nnumber of teams and senior\nmanagers contribute to the\noversight and management of\nareas such as environmental\nsustainability; community\ninvesting; talent and\ndiversity; ethics and business\npractices; and remuneration.\n\nCiti\u2019s climate governance\nstructure continues to evolve\nas Citi advances its\nunderstanding of its climate\nrisk and its progress under\nthe Net Zero plan. In addition\nto the expansion of the\nBoard\u2019s oversight of climate\nmatters (see Risk Management\nCommittee and Audit Committee\ndescriptions above), Citi has:\n\n\u2022 Expanded and realigned its\nclimate risk team to be part\nof the Enterprise Risk\nManagement function within\nRisk;\n\n\u2022 Further built out its Clean\nEnergy Transition (CET) team\n(formed in 2021 and expanded\nin 2022 to include Corporate\nBanking), which focuses on\nproviding advisory and\ncapital-raising services to\ncompanies involved in energy\ntransition; and\n\n\u2022 Launched two climate\ntraining pilots for its BCMA\n(Banking, Capital Markets and\nAdvisory), Risk Management and\nGlobal Functions teams\ninvolving in-person workshops\nfocused on providing\nfoundational knowledge of\nclimate risks and client\nengagement.\n                                                                \n  Key ESG Initiatives                                           \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Sustainable Progress Strategy                                 \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Sustainable Progress\nStrategy is summarized in its\nEnvironmental and Social\nPolicy Framework. The three\npillars of the strategy each\nhave climate-related elements\nand serve as the foundation\nfor Citi\u2019s climate\ncommitments:\n                               54                               \n\u2022 The first pillar, \u201cLow-\nCarbon Transition,\u201d focuses on\nfinancing and facilitating\nenvironmental and social\nfinance, including low-carbon\nsolutions, and supporting\nCiti\u2019s clients in their\ndecarbonization and transition\nstrategies.\n\n\u2022 The second pillar, \u201cClimate\nRisk,\u201d focuses on Citi\u2019s\nefforts to measure, manage and\nreduce the climate risk and\nimpact of its client\nportfolio. Areas of activity\ninclude portfolio analysis and\nstakeholder engagement as well\nas enhancing TCFD\nimplementation and disclosure.\n\n\u2022 The third pillar,\n\u201cSustainable Operations,\u201d\nfocuses on Citi\u2019s efforts to\nreduce the environmental\nfootprint of its facilities\nand strengthen its\nsustainability culture. This\nincludes minimizing the impact\nof its global operations\nthrough operational footprint\ngoals and further integrates\nsustainable practices across\nthe countries in which Citi\noperates.\n                                                                \n  Net Zero Emissions by 2050                                    \n                                                                \nCiti is a member of several\ninitiatives that enhance its\nunderstanding of climate-\nrelated issues, improve its\naccess to data and promote a\ncommon understanding and\nterminology across various\nclimate efforts. These\ninitiatives include the\nPartnership for Carbon\nAccounting Financials, the\nGlasgow Financial Alliance for\nNet Zero and the Net Zero\nBanking Alliance.\n\nAs previously disclosed, Citi\nhas committed to achieving net\nzero greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions associated with its\nfinancing by 2050, and net\nzero GHG emissions for its own\noperations by 2030; both are\nsignificant targets given the\nsize and breadth of Citi\u2019s\nlending portfolios, businesses\nand operational footprint.\nCiti made this commitment as\npart of its ongoing work to\nreduce its climate risk and\nimpact, grow its business in\nthe clean energy transition\nand help address the\nchallenges that climate change\nposes to the global economy\nand broader society. Citi\u2019s\nnet zero commitment\ndemonstrates how identifying,\nassessing and managing\nclimate-related risks and\nopportunities remains a top\nbusiness priority for Citi.\n\nWhile many financial\ninstitutions, including Citi,\nface increasing public\npressure to divest from\ncarbon-intensive sectors, Citi\nbelieves it has an important\nrole to play in advising and\nfinancing the transition to\nnet zero, and it plans to work\nclosely with clients in this\neffort. Citi recognizes that\nlarge-scale, rapid divestment\ncould result in an abrupt and\ndisorderly transition to a\nlow-carbon economy, creating\nboth economic and social\nupheaval. Citi believes that\nan orderly, responsible and\nequitable transition, which\naccounts for the immediate\neconomic needs of communities\nand workers, continued access\nto energy, environmental\njustice considerations and\nbroader economic development\nconcerns, is essential for the\nretention of political and\nsocial support to move to a\nlow-carbon economy.\n\nThe 2050 net zero commitment\nincludes the following\nframework, delineating the key\nareas required to achieve its\ntargets:\n\n\u2022 Calculate Emissions:\nCalculate baseline financed\nemissions for each carbon-\nintensive sector\n\n\u2022 Transition Pathway: Identify\nthe appropriate climate\nscenario transition pathway\n\n\u2022 Target Setting: Establish\nemissions reduction targets\nfor 2030 and beyond\n\n\u2022 Implementation Strategy:\nEngage with and assess clients\nto determine transition\nopportunities\n\n\u2022 External Engagement: Solicit\nfeedback from clients,\ninvestors and other\nstakeholders, as the work\ncontinues to evolve and the\nparties collectively define\nnet zero for the banking\nsector\n\nCiti\u2019s Net Zero plan includes:\n\n\u2022 Net Zero Metrics and Target\nSetting : Assess targets for\ncarbon-intensive sectors and\nexplore methodologies for\ncalculating financed emissions\nbeyond lending portfolios\n\n\u2022 Client Engagement and\nAssessment : Seek to\nunderstand clients\u2019 GHG\nemissions and work with them\nto develop their transition\nplans and advise on capacity\nbuilding\n\n\u2022 Risk Management : Assess\nclimate risk exposure across\nCiti\u2019s lending portfolios and\nreview client carbon reduction\nprogress, with ongoing review\nand refining of Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and thresholds and\npolicies related to Climate\nRisk Management\n\n\u2022 Clean Technology and\nTransition Finance : Support\nexisting and, where possible,\nnew technologies to accelerate\ncommercialization and provide\ntransition advisory and\nfinance, via debt and equity\nunderwriting\n\n\u2022 Portfolio Management :\nActive portfolio management to\nalign with net zero targets,\nincluding considerations of\ntransition measures taken by\nclients\n\n\u2022 Public Policy and Regulatory\nEngagement : Support enabling\npublic policy and regulation\nin the U.S. and other\ncountries where relevant\n\nIn 2022, Citi took the\nfollowing steps to\noperationalize its Net Zero\nplan:\n\n\u2022 In addition to the energy\nand power targets established\nlast year, Citi has set 2030\nemissions reduction targets\nfor four additional loan\nportfolio sectors: automotive\nmanufacturing, commercial real\nestate, steel and thermal coal\nmining.\n\n\u2022 Citi has begun piloting a\nNet Zero Review Template for\nits energy and power clients\nto better understand their\ntransition plans.\n\n\u2022 Citi worked with RMI to help\ndevelop and launch the\nSustainable STEEL Principles,\na s olution for measuring and\ndisclosing the alignment of\nsteel lending portfolios with\n1.5\u00b0C climate targets .\n                                                                \n  Financial Inclusion and Racial Equity                         \n                                                                \nBuilding on Citi\u2019s\nlongstanding focus on\nadvancing financial inclusion\nand economic opportunity for\ncommunities of color, in\nSeptember 2020, Citi and the\nCiti Foundation announced\nAction for Racial Equity\n(ARE), a set of strategic\ninitiatives to help close the\nracial wealth gap and increase\neconomic mobility in the U.S.\nAs part of ARE, Citi and the\nCiti Foundation have invested\nmore than $1 billion in\nstrategic initiatives to\nprovide greater access to\nbanking and credit in\ncommunities of color, increase\ninvestment in Black-owned\nbusinesses, expand access to\naffordable housing and\n                               55                               \nhomeownership among Black\nAmericans and advance anti-\nracist practices within Citi\nand across the financial\nservices industry.\n\nConsistent with its commitment\nto transparently report on\nARE, in December 2022 Citi\nreleased the results of a\nracial equity audit of ARE,\nwhich it had commissioned from\nthe law firm Covington &\nBurling. The audit assessed\nARE as an effort to help\naddress various drivers of the\nracial wealth gap by\nevaluating ARE\u2019s design,\nimplementation and extent of\nintegration into Citi\u2019s\nbusiness. The audit\u2019s overall\nassessment was that ARE was a\nwell-designed and credible\neffort to help address the\nracial wealth gap in the U.S.,\ngiven the dimensions of Citi\u2019s\nbusiness.

In\n2022, the first Company-wide approach for promotions to the\ncritical leadership role of Managing Director was launched, with\ncommon eligibility criteria across Citi, including risk and\ncontrol performance. Further, all potential successors to\nExecutive Management Team roles are evaluated by the Board and\nare now subject to a risk and controls assessment.\n                                                                \n  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion                               \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s Board is committed to ensuring that the Board and\nCiti\u2019s Executive Management Team are composed of individuals\nwhose backgrounds reflect the diversity of Citi\u2019s employees,\ncustomers and other stakeholders. In addition, Citi has\nincreased its efforts to diversify its workforce, including,\namong other things, taking actions with respect to pay equity,\nsetting representation goals and the use of diverse slates in\nrecruiting.\n                                                                \n  Pay Transparency and Pay Equity                               \n                                                                \nCiti values pay transparency and has taken significant action to\nensure that both managers and employees have greater clarity\naround Citi\u2019s compensation philosophy. Over the past two years,\nCiti introduced market-based salary structures and bonus\nopportunity guidelines in various countries worldwide. In\naddition, Citi recently began posting salary ranges on all\n\nexternal U.S. job postings, which aligns with strategic\nobjectives of pay equity and transparency. Citi also raised its\nU.S. minimum wage in 2022, the second broad-based increase in\nless than two years.\n\nCiti has focused on measuring and addressing pay equity within\nthe organization:\n\n\u2022 In 2018, Citi was the first major U.S. financial institution\nto publicly release the results of a pay equity review comparing\nits compensation of women to that of men, as well as U.S.\nminorities to U.S. non-minorities. Since 2018, Citi has\ncontinued to be transparent about pay equity, including\ndisclosing its unadjusted or \u201craw\u201d pay gap for both women and\nU.S. minorities. The raw gap measures the difference in median\ncompensation. The existence of Citi\u2019s raw pay gap reflects a\nneed to increase representation of women and U.S. minorities in\nsenior and higher-paying roles.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s 2022 pay equity review determined that on an adjusted\nbasis, women globally are paid on average more than 99% of what\nmen are paid at Citi, and that there was not a statistically\nsignificant difference in adjusted compensation for U.S.\nminorities and non-minorities.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s 2022 raw pay gap analysis showed that the median\n\npay for women globally is 78% of the median for men, up\n\nfrom 74% in 2021 and 2020. The median pay for U.S.\n\nminorities is more than 97% of the median for non-minorities,\nwhich is up from just above 96% in 2021 and 94% in 2020.\n                                                                \n  Representation Goals                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s management believes that a diverse workforce is key to\nthe Company\u2019s success in serving diverse clients and\ncommunities. In 2022, Citi announced that it exceeded its\nCompany-wide, aspirational diversity representation goals for\n2018\u20132021 to increase its percentages of women colleagues\nglobally and Black talent in the U.S.\n\nRecognizing that this was just a starting point, Citi has set\nnew goals for 2025. The new goals are more global, embrace more\ndimensions of diversity and include all levels of the Company.\n\nCiti\u2019s 2025 aspirational representation goals are embedded in\nits business strategy. Citi has goals for hiring and promoting\ncolleagues into roles at the Assistant Vice President to\nManaging Director levels across the organization, as well as\ngoals for campus hiring from colleges and universities. Having\naspirational goals across all levels\u2014from early career through\nsenior leadership roles\u2014will help ensure Citi not only has\ndiverse talent in leadership roles, but will also help the\nCompany build a diverse talent pipeline for the future.\n                                                                \n  Workforce Development                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s numerous programmatic offerings aim to reinforce its\nculture and values, foster understanding of compliance\nrequirements and develop competencies required to deliver\nexcellence to its clients. Citi encourages career growth and\ndevelopment by offering broad and diverse opportunities to\ncolleagues, including the following:\n\n\u2022 Citi provides a range of internal development and rotational\nprograms to colleagues at all levels, including an extensive\nleadership curriculum, allowing the opportunity to build the\nskills needed to transition to supervisory and managerial roles.\nCiti\u2019s tuition assistance program further enables colleagues in\nNorth America to pursue their educational goals.\n\n\u2022 Citi has a focus on internal talent development and aims to\nprovide colleagues with career growth opportunities, with more\nthan 33,000 open positions filled internally in 2022. These\nopportunities are particularly important as Citi focuses on\nproviding career paths for its internal talent base as part of\nits efforts to increase organic growth and promotions within the\norganization.\n                                                                \n  Wellness and Benefits                                         \n                                                                \nCiti is proud to provide a wide range of benefits that support\nits colleagues mentally, emotionally, physically and financially\nand through various life stages and events. The Company is\nfocused on providing equitable benefits that are designed to\nattract, engage and retain colleagues.\n\nCiti has significantly enhanced mental well-being programs by\noffering free counseling sessions for colleagues and their\nfamily members and adding real-time text, video and message-\nbased counseling in the U.S., as well as offering an online tool\nso that all colleagues around the globe can easily find their\nlocal Employee Assistance Programs and resources. Citi also\ncontinues to value the importance of physical well-\nbeing\u2014providing employees in several office locations and\ncountries access to onsite medical care clinics, fitness\ncenters, subsidized gym memberships and virtual fitness\nprograms.\n\nCiti continues expanding employee benefits to support colleagues\nand their families. In early 2020, Citi expanded its Paid\nParental Leave Policy to include Citi colleagues around the\nworld. Citi also began to offer additional leave opportunities\nto eligible colleagues, including the \u201cRefresh, Recharge,\nReenergize\u201d program, whereby employees are able to take up to 12\nweeks for a sabbatical to pursue a personal interest, and the\n\u201cGiving Back\u201d program, allowing employees to take up to four\nweeks to work with a charitable institution.\n\nIn 2022, Citi implemented a global, flexible work approach to\nprovide colleagues with the ability to balance the demands of\ntheir home lives with the work conditions that are necessary for\nsuccess. The \u201cHow We Work\u201d approach includes a new work model\nfor Citi, defined by three role designations for colleagues\nglobally: Resident, Hybrid or Remote. By embracing a flexible\nmodel of work, Citi has focused on keeping its approach\nconsistent and aligned with its values and priorities.\n\nFor additional information about Citi\u2019s human capital management\ninitiatives and goals, see Citi\u2019s 2021 ESG report available at\nwww.citigroup.com.

                                             \nFor Citi, effective risk\nmanagement is of primary\nimportance to its overall\noperations. Accordingly, Citi\nhas established an Enterprise\nRisk Management (ERM)\nFramework to ensure that all\nof Citi\u2019s risks are managed\nappropriately and consistently\nacross the Company and at an\naggregate, enterprise-wide\nlevel. Citi\u2019s culture drives a\nstrong risk and control\nenvironment, and is at the\nheart of the ERM Framework,\nunderpinning the way Citi\nconducts business. The\nactivities that Citi engages\nin, and the risks those\nactivities generate, must be\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s Mission\nand Value Proposition and the\nkey Leadership Principles that\nsupport it, as well as Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite. As discussed\nabove, Citi also continues its\nefforts to comply with the FRB\nand OCC consent orders,\nrelating principally to\nvarious aspects of risk\nmanagement, compliance, data\nquality management and\ngovernance, and internal\ncontrols (see \u201cCiti\u2019s Consent\nOrder Compliance\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Compliance Risks\u201d\nabove).\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition, which was\ndeveloped by its senior\nleadership and distributed\nthroughout the Company, Citi\nstrives to serve its clients\nas a trusted partner by\nresponsibly providing\nfinancial services that enable\ngrowth and economic progress\nwhile earning and maintaining\nthe public\u2019s trust by\nconstantly adhering to the\nhighest ethical standards. As\nsuch, Citi asks all colleagues\nto ensure that their decisions\npass three tests: they are in\nCiti\u2019s clients\u2019 best\ninterests, create economic\nvalue and are always\nsystemically responsible.\n\nAs discussed in \u201cHuman Capital\nResources and Management\u201d\nabove, Citi has designed\nLeadership Principles that\nrepresent the qualities,\nbehaviors and expectations all\nemployees must exhibit to\ndeliver on Citi\u2019s mission of\nenabling growth and economic\nprogress. The Leadership\nPrinciples inform Citi\u2019s ERM\nFramework and will contribute\nto creating a culture that\ndrives client, control and\noperational excellence. Citi\ncolleagues share a common\nresponsibility to uphold these\nleadership principles and hold\nthemselves to the highest\nstandards of ethics and\nprofessional behavior in\ndealing with Citi\u2019s clients,\nbusiness colleagues,\nshareholders, communities and\neach other.\n\nCiti\u2019s ERM Framework details\nthe principles used to support\neffective enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement across the end-to-\nend risk management lifecycle.\nThe ERM Framework covers the\nrisk management roles and\nresponsibilities of the\nCitigroup Board of Directors\n(the Board), Citi\u2019s Executive\nManagement Team (see \u201cRisk\nGovernance\u2014Executive\nManagement Team\u201d below) and\nemployees across the lines of\ndefense. The underlying\npillars of the framework\nencompass:\n\n\u2022 Culture \u2014the core principles\nand behaviors that underpin a\nstrong culture of risk\nawareness, in line with Citi\u2019s\nMission and Value Proposition,\nand Leadership Principles;\n\n\u2022 Governance \u2014the committee\nstructure and reporting\narrangements that support the\nappropriate oversight of risk\nmanagement activities at the\nBoard and Executive Management\nTeam levels;\n\n\u2022 Risk Management \u2014the end-to-\nend risk management cycle\nincluding the identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting of\nall risks including top,\nmaterial, growing,\nidiosyncratic and emerging\nrisks, and aggregated to an\nenterprise-wide level; and\n\n\u2022 Enterprise Programs \u2014the key\nrisk management programs\nperformed across the risk\nmanagement lifecycle for all\nrisk categories; these\nprograms also outline the\nspecific roles played by each\nof the lines of defense in\nthese processes.\n\nEach of these pillars is\nunderpinned by supporting\ncapabilities, which are the\ninfrastructure, people,\ntechnology and data, and\nmodelling and analytical\ncapabilities that are in place\nto enable the execution of the\nERM Framework.\n\nCiti\u2019s approach to risk\nmanagement requires that its\nrisk-taking be consistent with\nits risk appetite. The risk\nappetite is the aggregate\nlevel and types of risk Citi\nis willing to take or tolerate\nin order to meet its strategic\nobjectives and business plan.\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite framework\nis the overall firm-wide\napproach, including policies,\nprocesses, controls and\nsystems through which the risk\nappetite is established,\ncommunicated and monitored. In\naddition, underlying risk\nlimits and thresholds are\ndesigned to control\nconcentrations and\noperationalize risk appetite.\n\nCiti\u2019s risks are generally\ncategorized and summarized as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Credit risk is the risk of\nloss resulting from the\ndecline in credit quality (or\ndowngrade risk) or failure of\na borrower, counterparty,\nthird party or issuer to honor\nits financial or contractual\nobligations.\n\n\u2022 Liquidity risk is the risk\nthat Citi will not be able to\nefficiently meet both expected\nand unexpected current and\nfuture cash flow and\ncollateral needs without\nadversely affecting either\ndaily operations or financial\nconditions of Citi.\n\n\u2022 Market risk ( Trading and\nNon-Trading ): Market risk of\ntrading portfolios is the risk\nof loss arising from changes\nin the value of Citi\u2019s assets\nand liabilities resulting from\nchanges in market variables,\nsuch as interest rates,\nexchange rates, equity and\ncommodity prices or credit\nspreads. Market risk of non-\ntrading portfolios is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial condition and\nresilience arising from\nmovements in interest rates\nresulting from repricing risk,\nbasis risk, yield curve risk\nand options risk.\n\n\u2022 Operational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems,\nor from external events. It\nincludes legal risk, which is\nthe risk of loss (including\nlitigation costs, settlements\nand regulatory fines)\nresulting from Citi\u2019s failure\nto comply with laws,\nregulations, prudent ethical\nstandards or contractual\nobligations in any aspect of\nCiti\u2019s business, but excludes\nstrategic and reputation risks\n(see below).\n\n\u2022 Compliance risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial condition and\nresilience arising from\nviolations of laws, rules or\nregulations, or from non-\nconformance\n                               59                               \nwith prescribed practices,\ninternal policies and\nprocedures or ethical\nstandards.\n\n\u2022 Reputation risk is the risk\nto current or projected\nfinancial conditions and\nresilience from negative\nopinion held by stakeholders.\n\n\u2022 Strategic risk is the risk\nof a sustained impact (not\nepisodic impact) to Citi\u2019s\ncore strategic objectives as\nmeasured by impacts on\nanticipated earnings, market\ncapitalization or capital,\narising from the external\nfactors affecting the\nCompany\u2019s operating\nenvironment; as well as the\nrisks associated with defining\nthe strategy and executing the\nstrategy, which are\nidentified, measured and\nmanaged as part of the\nStrategic Risk Framework at\nthe Enterprise Level.\n\nCiti uses a lines of defense\nmodel as a key component of\nits ERM Framework to manage\nits risks. As discussed below,\nthe lines of defense model\nbrings together risk-taking,\nrisk oversight and risk\nassurance under one umbrella\nand provides an avenue for\nrisk accountability of first\nline of defense, a construct\nfor effective challenge by the\nsecond line of defense\n(Independent Risk Management\nand Independent Compliance\nRisk Management), and empowers\nindependent risk assurance by\nthe third line of defense\n(Internal Audit). In addition,\nthe lines of defense model\nincludes organizational units\ntasked with supporting a\nstrong control environment\n(\u201centerprise support\nfunctions\u201d). The first, second\nand third lines of defense,\nalong with enterprise support\nfunctions, have distinct roles\nand responsibilities and are\nempowered to perform relevant\nrisk management processes and\nresponsibilities in order to\nmanage Citi\u2019s risks in a\nconsistent and effective\nmanner.\n\nFirst Line of Defense: Front\nLine Units and Front Line Unit\nActivities\n\nCiti\u2019s first line of defense\nowns the risks and associated\ncontrols inherent in, or\narising from, the execution of\nits business activities and is\nresponsible for identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting\nthose risks consistent with\nCiti\u2019s strategy, Mission and\nValue Proposition, Leadership\nPrinciples and risk appetite.\n\nFront line units are\nresponsible and held\naccountable for managing the\nrisks associated with their\nactivities within the\nboundaries set by independent\nrisk management. They are also\nresponsible for designing and\nimplementing effective\ninternal controls and\nmaintaining processes for\nmanaging their risk profile,\nincluding through risk\nmitigation, so that it remains\nconsistent with Citi\u2019s\nestablished risk appetite.\n\nFront line unit activities are\nconsidered part of the first\nline of defense and are\nsubject to the oversight and\nchallenge of independent risk\nmanagement.\n                  The first line of defense is                  \n                  composed of Citi\u2019s Business                   \nManagement, Regional\nManagement, certain Corporate\nFunctions (Enterprise\nOperations and Technology,\nChief Administrative Office,\nGlobal Public Affairs, Office\nof the Citibank Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO) and\nFinance), as well as other\nfront line unit activities.\nFront line units may also\ninclude enterprise support\nunits and/or conduct\nenterprise support\nactivities\u2014see \u201cEnterprise\nSupport Functions\u201d below.\n\nSecond Line of Defense:\nIndependent Risk Management\nIndependent risk management\nunits are independent of the\nfirst line of defense. They\nare responsible for overseeing\nthe risk-taking activities of\nthe first line of defense and\nchallenging the first line of\ndefense in the execution of\nits risk management\nresponsibilities. They are\nalso responsible for\nindependently identifying,\nmeasuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting\naggregate risks and for\nsetting standards for the\nmanagement and oversight of\nrisk. Independent risk\nmanagement is composed of\nIndependent Risk Management\n(IRM) and Independent\nCompliance Risk Management\n(ICRM), which are led by the\nGroup Chief Risk Officer (CRO)\nand Group Chief Compliance\nOfficer (CCO) who have\nunrestricted access to the\nBoard and its Risk Management\nCommittee to facilitate the\nability to execute their\nspecific responsibilities\npertaining to escalation to\nthe Board.\n                                                                \n  Independent Risk Management                                   \n                                                                \nThe IRM organization sets risk\nand control standards for the\nfirst line of defense and\nactively manages and oversees\naggregate credit, market\n(trading and non-trading),\nliquidity, strategic,\noperational and reputation\nrisks across Citi, including\nrisks that span categories,\nsuch as concentration risk,\ncountry risk and climate risk.\n\nIRM is organized to align to\nrisk categories, legal\nentities/regions and Company-\nwide, cross-risk functions or\nprocesses. Each of these units\nreports to a member of the\nRisk Management Executive\nCouncil, who are all direct\nreports to the Citigroup CRO.\n                                                                \n  Independent Compliance Risk Management                        \n                                                                \nThe ICRM organization actively\noversees compliance risk\nacross Citi, sets compliance\nrisk and control standards for\nthe first line of defense to\nmanage compliance risk and\npromotes business conduct and\nactivity that is consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition and the compliance\nrisk appetite. Citi\u2019s\nobjective is to embed an\nenterprise-wide compliance\nrisk management framework and\nculture that identifies,\nmeasures, monitors, controls\nand escalates compliance risk\nacross Citi.\n\nICRM is aligned by product\nline, function and geography\nto provide compliance risk\nmanagement advice and credible\nchallenge on day-to-day\nmatters and strategic\ndecision-making for key\ninitiatives. ICRM also has\nprogram-level Enterprise\nCompliance units responsible\nfor setting standards and\nestablishing priorities for\nprogram-related compliance\nefforts. These Compliance Risk\nManagement heads report\ndirectly to the CCO. The CCO\nreports to Citi\u2019s General\nCounsel and ICRM is\norganizationally part of the\nGlobal Legal Affairs &\nCompliance group. In addition,\nthe CCO has matrix reporting\ninto the CRO and is part of\nthe Risk Management Executive\nCouncil.\n                                                                \n  Third Line of Defense: Internal Audit                         \n                                                                \nInternal Audit is independent\nof the first line, second line\nand enterprise support\nfunctions. The role of\nInternal Audit is to provide\nindependent, objective,\nreliable, valued and timely\nassurance to the Board, its\nAudit Committee, Citi senior\nmanagement and regulators over\nthe effectiveness of\ngovernance, risk management\nand controls that mitigate\n                               60                               \ncurrent and evolving risks and\nenhance the control culture\nwithin Citi. The Citi Chief\nAuditor manages Internal Audit\nand reports functionally to\nthe Chairman of the Citi Audit\nCommittee and administratively\nto the Citi Chief Executive\nOfficer. The Citi Chief\nAuditor has unrestricted\naccess to the Board and the\nBoard Audit Committee to\naddress risks and issues\nidentified through Internal\nAudit\u2019s activities.\n                                                                \n  Enterprise Support Functions                                  \n                                                                \nEnterprise support functions\nengage in activities that\nsupport safety and soundness\nacross Citi. These functions\nprovide advisory services\nand/or design, implement,\nmaintain and oversee Company-\nwide programs that support\nCiti in maintaining an\neffective control environment.\n\nEnterprise support functions\nare composed of Human\nResources and Legal (including\nCiti Security and\nInvestigative Services). Front\nline units may also include\nenterprise support units\nand/or conduct enterprise\nsupport activities (e.g., the\nControllers Group within\nFinance).\n\nEnterprise support functions,\nunits and activities are\nsubject to the relevant\nCompany-wide independent\noversight processes specific\nto the risks for which they\nare accountable (e.g.,\noperational risk, compliance\nrisk, reputation risk).\n                                                                \n  Risk Governance                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ERM Framework\nencompasses risk management\nprocesses to address risks\nundertaken by Citi through\nidentification, measurement,\nmonitoring, controlling and\nreporting of all risks.

Credit risk is\none of the most significant\nrisks Citi faces as an\ninstitution. For additional\ninformation, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Credit Risk\u201d above.\nCredit risk arises in many of\nCitigroup\u2019s business\nactivities, including:\n\n\u2022 consumer, commercial and\ncorporate lending;\n\n\u2022 capital markets derivative\ntransactions;\n\n\u2022 structured finance; and\n\n\u2022 securities financing\ntransactions (repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nand securities loaned and\nborrowed).\n\nCredit risk also arises from\nclearing and settlement\nactivities, when Citi\ntransfers an asset in advance\nof receiving its counter-value\nor advances funds to settle a\ntransaction on behalf of a\nclient. Concentration risk,\nwithin credit risk, is the\nrisk associated with having\ncredit exposure concentrated\nwithin a specific client,\nindustry, region or other\ncategory.\n\nCiti has an established\nframework in place for\nmanaging credit risk across\nall businesses that includes a\ndefined risk appetite, credit\nlimits and credit policies.\nCiti\u2019s credit risk management\nframework also includes\npolicies and procedures to\nmanage problem exposures.\n\nTo manage concentration risk,\nCiti has in place a framework\nconsisting of industry limits,\nsingle-name concentrations for\neach business and across\nCitigroup and a specialized\nproduct limit framework.\n\nCredit exposures are generally\nreported in notional terms for\naccrual loans, reflecting the\nvalue at which the loans as\nwell as other off-balance\nsheet commitments are carried\non the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit exposure arising\nfrom capital markets\nactivities is generally\nexpressed as the current mark-\nto-market, net of margin,\nreflecting the net value owed\nto Citi by a given\ncounterparty.\n\nThe credit risk associated\nwith Citi\u2019s credit exposures\nis a function of the\nidiosyncratic creditworthiness\nof the obligor, as well as the\nterms and conditions of the\nspecific obligation. Citi\nassesses the credit risk\nassociated with its credit\nexposures on a regular basis\nthrough its allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL) process\n(see \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses\u201d below and Notes 1 and\n15), as well as through\nregular stress testing at the\ncompany, business, geography\nand product levels. These\nstress-testing processes\ntypically estimate potential\nincremental credit costs that\nwould occur as a result of\neither downgrades in the\ncredit quality or defaults of\nthe obligors or\ncounterparties.

As\nobligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, downgrades may\nresult in the purchase of\nadditional credit derivatives\nor other risk mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector.

The Retail bank is\nconcentrated in six major U.S.\nmetropolitan areas. Global\nWealth provides investment\nservices, cards, mortgages and\npersonal, small business and\nother consumer loans through\nthe Private bank, Wealth at\nWork and Citigold. As of\nDecember 31, 2022,\napproximately 45% of PBWM\nconsumer loans consisted of\nBranded cards and Retail\nservices card loans, which\ngenerally drives the overall\ncredit performance of PBWM ,\nas U.S. Cards net credit\nlosses represent approximately\n90% of total PBWM losses. As\nshown in the chart above, the\nfourth quarter of 2022 net\ncredit loss rate in PBWM\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, driven by\nan increase in net flow rates,\nprimarily reflecting ongoing\nnormalization from\nhistorically low levels in\nU.S. Cards. PBWM \u2019s 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, also\ndriven by an increase in net\nflow rates, primarily\nreflecting the ongoing\nnormalization in U.S. Cards.\n                 \n  Branded Cards  \n                 \nU.S. Personal Banking\u2019s\nBranded cards portfolio\nincludes proprietary and co-\nbranded cards.

The\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate increased quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over year,\nalso driven by an increase in\nnet flow rates, primarily\nreflecting the ongoing\nnormalization.\n                   \n  Retail Services  \n                   \nU.S. Personal Banking\u2019s Retail\nservices partners directly\nwith more than 20 retailers\nand dealers to offer private\nlabel and co-branded cards.\nRetail services\u2019 target market\nfocuses on select industry\nsegments such as home\nimprovement, specialty retail,\nconsumer electronics and fuel.\nRetail services continually\nevaluates opportunities to add\npartners within target\nindustries that have strong\nloyalty, lending or payment\nprograms and growth potential.\nAs shown in the chart above,\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nservices increased quarter-\nover-quarter and year-over-\nyear, driven by an increase in\nnet flow rates, primarily\nreflecting the ongoing\nnormalization from\nhistorically low levels. The\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate increased quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year,\nalso driven by an increase in\nnet flow rates, primarily\nreflecting the ongoing\nnormalization.

The portfolio is\ngenerally delinquency managed,\nwhere Citi evaluates credit\nrisk based on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 14. As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nbanking for the fourth quarter\nof 2022 increased slightly\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nthe continued impact of\nindustry-wide episodic\noverdraft losses. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by U.S. mortgages,\nwhich reflected the lasting\neffects of government\nstimulus, unemployment\nbenefits and consumer relief\nprograms.\n                 \n  Global Wealth  \n                 \nAs discussed above, the Global\nWealth credit portfolio\nprimarily consists of consumer\nmortgages, cards and other\nlending products extended to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom the affluent to ultra-\nhigh-net-worth through the\nPrivate bank, Wealth at Work\nand Citigold. These customer\nsegments represent a target\nmarket that is characterized\nby historically low default\nrates and delinquencies. As of\nDecember 31, 2022,\napproximately $49 billion, or\n33%, of the portfolio was\nclassifiably managed and\nprimarily consisted of margin\nlending, commercial real\nestate, subscription credit\nfinance and other lending\nprograms. These classifiably\nmanaged loans are primarily\nevaluated for credit risk\nbased on their internal risk\nrating, of which 95% is rated\ninvestment grade. While the\ndelinquency rate in the chart\nabove is calculated only for\nthe delinquency-managed\nportfolio, the net credit loss\nrate is calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate and 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate were\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter and year-over-year,\nreflecting the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\nThe net credit loss rate\nincreased slightly quarter-\nover-quarter, due to a\nclassifiably managed loan\ncharge-off. The low levels of\nnet credit losses\n\nand the 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate continued to\nreflect the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\nLegacy Franchises Legacy\nFranchises provides\ntraditional retail banking and\nbranded card products to\nretail and small business\ncustomers in Asia Consumer and\nMexico Consumer.\n                   \n  Asia(1)Consumer  \n                   \n(1) Asia Consumer includes\nLegacy Franchises activities\nin certain EMEA countries for\nall periods presented. As\nshown in the chart above, the\nfourth quarter of 2022 net\ncredit loss rate in Asia\nConsumer for the remaining\nportfolios held-for-investment\n(China, Korea, Russia and\nPoland) increased quarter-\nover-quarter, primarily driven\nby lower average loans due to\nthe ongoing wind-down of the\nbusinesses, particularly in\nKorea (decline of $1.5\nbillion) and the sale of the\npersonal loan portfolio in\nRussia in the fourth quarter\nof 2022. The net credit loss\nrate increased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by lower\naverage loans due to the\nongoing wind-down of the\nbusinesses, particularly in\nKorea (decline of $7.8\nbillion) and the sale of the\npersonal loan portfolio in\nRussia, partially offset by\nthe reclassification of loans\nto held-for-sale during 2022.\nThe 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate was largely\nunchanged quarter-over-quarter\nand decreased year-over-year,\nmainly driven by the impact of\nthe Asia Consumer held-for-\nsale reclassifications,\npartially offset by the effect\nof declining loans due to the\nongoing wind-down of the\nbusinesses, including the sale\nof the personal loan portfolio\nin Russia. The performance of\nAsia Consumer\u2019s portfolios\ncontinues to reflect the\nstrong credit profiles in the\nregion\u2019s target customer\nsegments.\n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \n                               71                               \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex and\nprovides credit cards,\nconsumer mortgages and small\nbusiness and personal loans.\nMexico Consumer serves a more\nmass-market segment in Mexico\nand focuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As shown in\nthe chart above, the fourth\nquarter of 2022 net credit\nloss rate in Mexico Consumer\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the impact of the\ncharge-off of peak\ndelinquencies in early 2021,\nwhich resulted in lower\ndelinquencies, leading to\nlower net credit losses in the\ncurrent quarter. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate was\nlargely unchanged quarter-\nover-quarter and decreased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the impact of the\ncharge-off of peak\ndelinquencies and higher\npayment rates.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $89 million ($0.6 billion), $185 million ($1.1\nbillion) and $171 million ($0.7 billion) at December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans\n30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans have the\nsame adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $70\nmillion, $74 million and $98 million at December 31, 2022, 2021\nand 2020, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the\nguaranteed loans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail\nservices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status, and therefore\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of December\n31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 96%, 94% and 92% of Global Wealth\nclassifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For\nadditional information on the credit quality of the Global\nWealth portfolio, including classifiably managed portfolios, see\n\u201cConsumer Credit Trends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain\nEMEA countries for all periods presented.\n                               73                               \n(8) Citi recently entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nconsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nreclassifications commenced as follows: Australia (3Q21, and\nclosed on June 1, 2022), the Philippines (4Q21, and closed on\nAugust 1, 2022) and Bahrain, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan,\nThailand and Vietnam (1Q22) (Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand\nclosed in 4Q22). See Note 2 for additional information.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $90 million ($0.3 billion), $138 million ($0.4\nbillion) and $183 million ($0.5 billion) at December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans\n30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans have the\nsame adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $37\nmillion, $35 million and $73 million at December 31, 2022, 2021\nand 2020, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the\nguaranteed loans.\n\nN/A Not applicable\n                                                                \n  Consumer Loan Net Credit Losses and Ratios

The ASC introduces a new credit loss methodology\nrequiring earlier recognition of credit losses while also\nproviding additional disclosure about credit risk. On January 1,\n2020, Citi recorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%,\npretax increase in the Allowance for credit losses , along with\na $3.1 billion after-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a\ndeferred tax asset increase of $1.0 billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $4.9 billion build to the consumer ACL due\nto longer estimated tenors than under the incurred loss\nmethodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries, and (ii) a\n$0.8 billion decrease to the corporate ACL due to shorter\nremaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more\nspecific historical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies. See Note 1 for\nfurther discussion on the impact of Citi\u2019s adoption of CECL.\n\n(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable\npost-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded\nas an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening allowance for\ncredit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1.\n\n(3) Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses,\nsuch as changes in the allowance from acquisitions,\ndispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase\naccounting adjustments, etc.\n\n(4) 2022 includes an approximate $350 million reclass related to\nthe announced sales of Citi\u2019s consumer banking businesses in\nThailand, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Bahrain and\nVietnam. Also includes a decrease of approximately $100 million\nrelated to FX translation.\n\n(5) 2021 includes an approximate $280 million reclass related to\nCiti\u2019s agreement to sell its Australia consumer banking business\nand an approximate $90 million reclass related to Citi\u2019s\nagreement to sell its Philippines consumer banking business.\nThose ACLL were reclassified to Other assets during 2021. 2021\nalso includes a decrease of approximately $134 million related\nto FX translation.\n\n(6) 2020 includes reductions of approximately $4 million related\nto the transfer to HFS of various real estate loan portfolios.\nIn addition, 2020 includes an increase of approximately $97\nmillion related to FX translation.\n\n(7) 2019 includes reductions of approximately $42 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios. In addition, 2019 includes a reduction of\napproximately $60 million related to FX translation.\n\n(8) 2018 includes reductions of approximately $201 million\nrelated to the sale or transfer to HFS of various loan\nportfolios, which include approximately $106 million related to\nthe transfer of various real estate loan portfolios to HFS.\n\n(9) December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 exclude $5.4\nbillion, $6.1 billion, $6.9 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.2\nbillion, respectively, of loans that are carried at fair value.\n\n(10) 2020 corporate ACLUC includes a non-provision transfer of\n$68 million, representing reserves on performance guarantees.\nThe reserves on these contracts were reclassified out of the ACL\non unfunded lending commitments and into other liabilities.\n\n(11) Represents additional credit reserves recorded as Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n(12) Beginning in 2020, under CECL, the ACLL represents\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio\nand troubled debt restructurings. See \u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant Estimates\u201d and Note 1 below.\nAttribution of the ACLL is made for analytical purposes only and\nthe entire ACLL is available to absorb credit losses in the\noverall portfolio. Prior to 2020, the ACLL represented\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of probable losses inherent in the\nportfolio, as well as probable losses related to large\nindividually evaluated impaired loans and TDRs.\n                               78                               \n                                                                \n  Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (ACLL)

and\nrenegotiated loans. The\nfollowing summary provides a\ngeneral description of each\ncategory.\n\nNon-Accrual Loans and Assets :\n\n\u2022 Corporate and consumer\n(including commercial banking)\nnon-accrual status is based on\nthe determination that payment\nof interest or principal is\ndoubtful.\n\n\u2022 A corporate loan may be\nclassified as non-accrual and\nstill be performing under the\nterms of the loan structure.\nNon-accrual loans may still be\ncurrent on interest payments.\nCiti\u2019s corporate non-accrual\nloans were $1.1 billion, $1.5\nbillion and $1.6 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022, September\n30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively.

Corporate non-accrual\nloans may still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans.

Funding and\nliquidity risks arise from\nseveral factors, many of which\nare mostly or entirely outside\nCiti\u2019s control, such as\ndisruptions in the financial\nmarkets, changes in key\nfunding sources, credit\nspreads, changes in Citi\u2019s\ncredit ratings and\nmacroeconomic, geopolitical\nand other conditions. For\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Liquidity\nRisks\u201d above.\n\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nmanagement objectives are\naimed at (i) funding its\nexisting asset base, (ii)\ngrowing its core businesses,\n(iii) maintaining sufficient\nliquidity, structured\nappropriately, so that Citi\ncan operate under a variety of\nadverse circumstances,\nincluding potential Company-\nspecific and/or market\nliquidity events in varying\ndurations and severity, and\n(iv) satisfying regulatory\nrequirements, including, but\nnot limited to, those related\nto resolution planning (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cResolution Plan\u201d and \u201cTotal\nLoss-Absorbing Capacity\n(TLAC)\u201d below). Citigroup\u2019s\nprimary liquidity objectives\nare established by entity, and\nin aggregate, across two major\ncategories:\n\n\u2022 Citibank (including Citibank\nEurope plc, Citibank Singapore\nLtd. and Citibank (Hong Kong)\nLtd.); and\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s non-bank and other\nentities, including the parent\nholding company (Citigroup\nInc.), Citi\u2019s primary\nintermediate holding company\n(Citicorp LLC), Citi\u2019s broker-\ndealer subsidiaries (including\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc.,\nCitigroup Global Markets\nLimited and Citigroup Global\nMarkets Japan Inc.) and other\nbank and non-bank subsidiaries\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup (including\nCitibanamex).\n\nAt an aggregate Citigroup\nlevel, Citi\u2019s goal is to\nmaintain sufficient funding in\namount and tenor to fully fund\ncustomer assets and to provide\nan appropriate amount of cash\nand high-quality liquid assets\n(as discussed below), even in\ntimes of stress, in order to\nmeet its payment obligations\nas they come due. The\nliquidity risk management\nframework provides that in\naddition to the aggregate\nrequirements, certain entities\nbe self-sufficient or net\nproviders of liquidity,\nincluding in conditions\nestablished under their\ndesignated stress tests.\n\nCiti\u2019s primary funding sources\ninclude (i) corporate and\nconsumer deposits via Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries, including\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank),\n(ii) long-term debt (primarily\nsenior and subordinated debt)\nmainly issued by Citigroup\nInc., as the parent, and\nCitibank, and (iii)\nstockholders\u2019 equity. These\nsources may be supplemented by\nshort-term borrowings,\nprimarily in the form of\nsecured funding transactions.\n\nCiti\u2019s funding and liquidity\nframework, working in concert\nwith overall asset/liability\nmanagement, ensures that there\nis sufficient liquidity and\ntenor in the overall liability\nstructure (including funding\nproducts) of the Company\nrelative to the liquidity\nrequirements of Citi\u2019s assets.\nThis reduces the\n\nrisk that liabilities will\nbecome due before assets\nmature or are monetized. The\nCompany holds excess\nliquidity, primarily in the\nform of high-quality liquid\nassets (HQLA), as presented in\nthe table below.\n\nCiti\u2019s liquidity is managed\ncentrally by Corporate\nTreasury, in conjunction with\nregional and in-country\ntreasurers with oversight\nprovided by Independent Risk\nManagement and various Asset &\nLiability Committees (ALCOs)\nat the individual entity,\nregion, country and business\nlevels. Pursuant to this\napproach, Citi\u2019s HQLA are\nmanaged with emphasis on\nasset/liability management and\nentity-level liquidity\nadequacy throughout Citi.\n\nCiti\u2019s CRO and CFO co-chair\nCitigroup\u2019s ALCO, which\nincludes Citi\u2019s Treasurer and\nother senior executives. The\nALCO sets the strategy of the\nliquidity portfolio and\nmonitors portfolio performance\n(for additional information\nabout the ALCO, see \u201cRisk\nGovernance\u2014Board and Executive\nManagement Committees\u201d above).\nSignificant changes to\nportfolio asset allocations\nare approved by the ALCO. Citi\nalso has other ALCOs, which\nare established at various\norganizational levels to\nensure appropriate oversight\nfor individual entities,\ncountries, franchise\nbusinesses and regions,\nserving as the primary\ngovernance committees for\nmanaging Citi\u2019s balance sheet\nand liquidity.\n\nAs a supplement to ALCO,\nCiti\u2019s Funding and Liquidity\nRisk Committee (FLRC) is\nfocused on funding and\nliquidity risk matters. The\nFLRC reviews and discusses the\nfunding and liquidity risk\nprofile of, as well as risk\nmanagement practices for,\nCitigroup and Citibank and\nreports its findings and\nrecommendations to each\nrelevant ALCO as appropriate.\n                                                                \n  Liquidity Monitoring and Measurement                          \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                \nLiquidity stress testing is\nperformed for each of Citi\u2019s\nmajor entities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries.\nStress testing and scenario\nanalyses are intended to\nquantify the potential impact\nof an adverse liquidity event\non the balance sheet and\nliquidity position, in order\nto have sufficient liquidity\non hand to manage through such\nan event. These scenarios\ninclude assumptions about\nsignificant changes in key\nfunding sources, market\ntriggers (such as credit\nratings), potential uses of\nfunding and macroeconomic,\ngeopolitical and other\nconditions. These conditions\ninclude expected and stressed\nmarket conditions as well as\nCompany-specific events.\n\nLiquidity stress tests are\nperformed to ascertain\npotential mismatches between\nliquidity sources and uses\nover a variety of time\nhorizons and over different\nstressed conditions. To\nmonitor the liquidity of an\nentity, these stress tests and\npotential mismatches are\ncalculated on a daily basis.\n\nGiven the range of potential\nstresses, Citi maintains\ncontingency funding plans on a\nconsolidated basis and for\nindividual entities. These\nplans specify a wide range of\nreadily available actions for\na variety of adverse market\nconditions or idiosyncratic\nstresses.\n                               85                               \n                                                                \n  High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                 $      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \nNote: The amounts shown in the\ntable above are presented on\nan average basis.

These amounts\ninclude the HQLA needed to\nmeet the minimum requirements\nat these entities as well as\nany amounts in excess of these\nminimums that are available to\nbe transferred to other\nentities within Citigroup.\nCitigroup\u2019s average HQLA\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nas of the fourth quarter of\n2022, primarily driven by\nwholesale unsecured debt\nissuances. As of December 31,\n2022, Citigroup had\napproximately $1,045 billion\nof available liquidity\nresources to support client\nand business needs, including\nend-of-period HQLA assets;\nadditional unencumbered\nsecurities, including excess\nliquidity held at bank\nentities that is non-\ntransferable to other entities\nwithin Citigroup; available\nassets not already accounted\nfor within Citi\u2019s HQLA to\nsupport the Federal Home Loan\nBank (FHLB); and Federal\nReserve Bank discount window\nborrowing capacity.\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR. The LCR is calculated by\ndividing HQLA by estimated net\noutflows assuming a stressed\n30-day period, with the net\noutflows determined by\nstandardized stress outflow\nand inflow rates prescribed in\nthe LCR rule. The outflows are\npartially offset by\ncontractual inflows from\nassets maturing within 30\ndays.

In general, a\nbank\u2019s available stable\nfunding includes portions of\nequity, deposits and long-term\ndebt, while its required\nstable funding will be based\non the liquidity\ncharacteristics of its assets,\nderivatives and commitments.\nStandardized weightings are\nrequired to be applied to the\nvarious asset and liability\nclasses. The ratio of\navailable stable funding to\nrequired stable funding is\nrequired to be greater than\n100%. The rule became\neffective beginning July 1,\n2021, while public disclosure\nrequirements to report the\nratio will occur on a\nsemiannual basis beginning\nJune 30, 2023. Citi was in\ncompliance with the rule as of\nDecember 31, 2022.

Corporate/Other\naverage deposits increased $25\nbillion year-over-year, due to\nthe issuance of institutional\ncertificates of deposit as\nCiti continues to diversify\nits funding profile.\n                               87                               \nLong-Term Debt Long-term debt\n(generally defined as debt\nwith original maturities of\none year or more) represents\nthe most significant component\nof Citi\u2019s funding for the\nCitigroup parent company and\nCiti\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries\nand is a supplementary source\nof funding for the bank\nentities. Long-term debt is an\nimportant funding source due\nin part to its multiyear\ncontractual maturity\nstructure. The weighted-\naverage maturity of unsecured\nlong-term debt issued by\nCitigroup and its affiliates\n(including Citibank) with a\nremaining life greater than\none year was approximately 7.6\nyears as of December 31, 2022,\ncompared to 8.6 years as of\nthe prior year and 7.8 years\nas of the prior quarter. The\nweighted-average maturity is\ncalculated based on the\ncontractual maturity of each\nsecurity. For securities that\nare redeemable prior to\nmaturity at the option of the\nholder, the weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the earliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable. Citi\u2019s\nlong-term debt outstanding at\nthe Citigroup parent company\nincludes benchmark senior and\nsubordinated debt and what\nCiti refers to as customer-\nrelated debt, consisting of\nstructured notes, such as\nequity- and credit-linked\nnotes, as well as non-\nstructured notes. Citi\u2019s\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt is generally driven by\ncustomer demand and\ncomplements benchmark debt\nissuance as a source of\nfunding for Citi\u2019s non-bank\nentities. Citi\u2019s long-term\ndebt at the bank includes bank\nnotes, FHLB advances and\nsecuritizations.\n\nLong-Term Debt Outstanding The\nfollowing table presents\nCiti\u2019s end-of-period total\nlong-term debt outstanding for\neach of the dates indicated:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  billions                                                      \n  of                Dec. 31,        Sept. 30,         Dec. 31,  \n  dollars               2022             2022             2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Non-bank\u2026                                                     \n  Benchmark                                                     \n  debt:                                                         \n  Senior       $       117.5    $       112.7    $       117.8  \n  debt                                                          \n  Subordin\u2026             22.5             22.4             25.7  \n  debt                                                          \n  Trust                  1.6              1.6              1.7  \n  preferred                                                     \n  Customer\u2026            101.1             86.9             78.3  \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                7.8              7.0              7.3  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $       250.5    $       230.6    $       230.8  \n  non-bank                                                      \n  Bank                                                          \n  FHLB         $         7.3    $         7.3    $         5.3  \n  borrowin\u2026                                                     \n  Securiti\u2026              7.6              8.4              9.6  \n  Citibank                                                      \n  benchmark              2.6              2.5              3.6  \n  senior                                                        \n  debt                                                          \n  Local                                                         \n  country                3.6              4.3              5.1  \n  and                                                           \n  other(2)                                                      \n  Total        $        21.1    $        22.5    $        23.6  \n  bank                                                          \n  Total                                                         \n  long-term    $       271.6    $       253.1    $       254.4  \n  debt                                                          \n                                                                \nNote: Amounts represent the\ncurrent value of long-term\ndebt on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet that, for\ncertain debt instruments,\nincludes consideration of fair\nvalue, hedging impacts and\nunamortized discounts and\npremiums.

FDIC and\nFederal Reserve Board (FRB) to\nperiodically submit a plan for\nCiti\u2019s rapid and orderly\nresolution under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in the event\nof material financial distress\nor failure. Citigroup will\nalternate between submitting a\nfull resolution plan and a\ntargeted resolution plan on a\nbiennial cycle.\n\nOn November 22, 2022, the FRB\nand FDIC issued feedback on\nthe resolution plans filed on\nJuly 1, 2021 by the eight U.S.\nglobal systemically important\nbanks (GSIBs), including\nCitigroup. The FRB and FDIC\nidentified one shortcoming,\nbut no deficiencies, in\nCitigroup\u2019s 2021 resolution\nplan regarding data integrity\nand data quality management\nissues. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s\nresolution plan submissions,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisks\u201d above.\n\nUnder Citi\u2019s preferred \u201csingle\npoint of entry\u201d resolution\nplan strategy, only Citigroup,\nthe parent holding company,\nwould enter into bankruptcy,\nwhile Citigroup\u2019s material\nlegal entities (as defined in\nthe public section of its 2021\nresolution plan, which can be\nfound on the FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s\nwebsites) would remain\noperational outside of any\nresolution or insolvency\nproceedings. Citigroup\u2019s\nresolution plan has been\ndesigned to minimize the risk\nof systemic impact to the U.S.\nand global financial systems,\nwhile maximizing the value of\nthe bankruptcy estate for the\nbenefit of Citigroup\u2019s\ncreditors, including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders.\n\nIn addition, in line with the\nFRB\u2019s final total loss-\nabsorbing capacity (TLAC)\nrule, Citigroup believes it\nhas developed the resolution\nplan so that Citigroup\u2019s\nshareholders and unsecured\ncreditors\u2014including its\nunsecured long-term debt\nholders\u2014bear any losses\nresulting from Citigroup\u2019s\nbankruptcy. Accordingly, any\nvalue realized by holders of\nits unsecured long-term debt\nmay not be sufficient to repay\nthe amounts owed to such debt\nholders in the event of a\nbankruptcy or other resolution\nproceeding of Citigroup.\n\nThe FDIC has also indicated\nthat it was developing a\nsingle point of entry strategy\nto implement the Orderly\nLiquidation Authority under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, which provides the FDIC\nwith the ability to resolve a\nfirm when it is determined\nthat bankruptcy would have\nserious adverse effects on\nfinancial stability in the\nU.S.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in\nresponse to feedback received\nfrom the FRB and FDIC,\nCitigroup took the following\nactions:\n\n(i) Citicorp LLC (Citicorp),\nan existing wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Citigroup, was\nestablished as an intermediate\nholding company (an IHC) for\ncertain of Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities;\n\n(ii) Citigroup executed an\ninter-affiliate agreement with\nCiticorp, Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities and certain other\naffiliated entities pursuant\nto which Citicorp is required\nto provide liquidity and\ncapital support to Citigroup\u2019s\noperating material legal\nentities in the event\nCitigroup were to enter\nbankruptcy proceedings (Citi\nSupport Agreement);\n\n(iii) pursuant to the Citi\nSupport Agreement:\n\n\u2022 Citigroup made an initial\ncontribution of assets,\nincluding certain high-quality\nliquid assets and inter-\naffiliate loans (Contributable\nAssets), to Citicorp, and\nCiticorp became the business-\nas-usual funding vehicle for\nCitigroup\u2019s operating material\nlegal entities;\n\n\u2022 Citigroup will be obligated\nto continue to transfer\nContributable Assets to\nCiticorp over time, subject to\ncertain amounts retained by\nCitigroup to, among other\nthings, meet Citigroup\u2019s near-\nterm cash needs;\n\n\u2022 in the event of a Citigroup\nbankruptcy, Citigroup will be\nrequired to contribute most of\nits remaining assets to\nCiticorp; and\n\n(iv) the obligations of both\nCitigroup and Citicorp under\nthe Citi Support Agreement, as\nwell as the Contributable\nAssets, are secured pursuant\nto a security agreement.\n\nThe Citi Support Agreement\nprovides two mechanisms,\nbesides Citicorp\u2019s issuing of\ndividends to Citigroup,\npursuant to which Citicorp\nwill be required to transfer\ncash to Citigroup during\nbusiness as usual so that\nCitigroup can fund its debt\nservice as well as other\noperating needs: (i) one or\nmore funding notes issued by\nCiticorp to Citigroup and (ii)\na committed line of credit\nunder which Citicorp may make\nloans to Citigroup.\n                                                                \n  Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)                          \n                                                                \nU.S. GSIBs are required to\nmaintain minimum levels of\nTLAC and eligible LTD, each\nset by reference to the GSIB\u2019s\nconsolidated risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and total\nleverage exposure. The\nintended purpose of the\nrequirements is to facilitate\nthe orderly resolution of U.S.\nGSIBs under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code and Title II\nof the Dodd-Frank Act. For\nadditional information,\nincluding Citi\u2019s TLAC and LTD\namounts and ratios, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Current\nRegulatory Capital Standards\u201d\nabove.\n                               90                               \nSECURED FUNDING TRANSACTIONS\nAND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $202\nbillion as of December 31,\n2022 increased 6% from the\nprior year and was unchanged\nsequentially, driven by normal\nbusiness activity. The average\nbalance for secured funding\nwas approximately $205 billion\nfor the quarter ended December\n31, 2022.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $47 billion as of the\nfourth quarter of 2022\nincreased 68% year-over-year,\nreflecting an increase in FHLB\nadvances and commercial paper\nissuance, as Citi continues to\ndiversify its funding profile,\nand decreased 1% sequentially,\ndriven by normal business\nactivity (see Note 18 for\nfurther information on\nCitigroup\u2019s and its\naffiliates\u2019 outstanding short-\nterm borrowings).\n                               91                               \n                                                                \n  CREDIT RATINGS                                                \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, funding capacity,\nability to access capital\nmarkets and other sources of\nfunds, the cost of these funds\nand its ability to maintain\ncertain deposits are partially\ndependent on its credit\nratings.\n\nThe table below shows the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of December 31,\n2022.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Liquidity Risks\u201d\nabove.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $0.5 billion,\ncompared to $0.6 billion as of\nSeptember 30, 2022. Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured financing transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely affected.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.4\nbillion, compared to $0.8\nbillion as of September 30,\n2022. Other funding sources,\nsuch as secured financing\ntransactions and other margin\nrequirements, for which there\nare no explicit triggers,\ncould also be adversely\naffected.\n\nIn total, as of December 31,\n2022, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup Inc. and Citibank\nacross all three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$0.9 billion, compared to $1.4\nbillion as of September 30,\n2022 (see also Note 23). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings at certain Citibank\nsubsidiaries. Mitigating\nactions available to Citibank\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, selling or financing\nhighly liquid government\nsecurities, tailoring levels\nof secured lending, adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nassets, reducing loan\noriginations and renewals,\nraising additional deposits or\nborrowing from the FHLB or\ncentral banks. Citi believes\nthese mitigating actions could\nsubstantially reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above.\n                               92                               \n                                                                \n  Citibank\u2014Additional Potential Impacts                         \n                                                                \nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of December 31,\n2022, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximate ly\n$11.0 billion t o consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, compared to $9.1\nbillion as of December 31,\n2021 (see Note 22 fo r\nadditional information).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               93                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  OVERVIEW                                                      \n                                                                \nMarket risk is the potential\nfor losses arising from\nchanges in the value of Citi\u2019s\nassets and liabilities\nresulting from changes in\nmarket variables such as\ninterest rates, foreign\nexchange rates, equity prices,\ncommodity prices and credit\nspreads, as well as their\nimplied volatilities. Market\nrisk arises from both Citi\u2019s\ntrading and non-trading\nportfolios. For additional\ninformation on market risk and\nmarket risk management at\nCiti, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nabove.\n\nEach business is required to\nestablish, with approval from\nCiti\u2019s market risk management,\na market risk limit framework\nfor identified risk factors\nthat clearly defines approved\nrisk profiles and is within\nthe parameters of Citi\u2019s\noverall risk appetite.

Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Banking Book Interest Rate Risk                               \n                                                                \nFor interest rate risk\npurposes, Citi\u2019s non-trading\nportfolios are referred to as\nthe Banking Book. Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset &\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from Treasury Risk\nManagement, a second line of\ndefense team reporting to the\nTreasury Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rate\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nSince the third quarter of\n2022, Citi has employed\nenhanced IRE methodologies and\nchanges to certain\nassumptions. The changes\nincluded, among other things,\nassumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet and\nrevisions to the treatment of\ncertain business contributions\n(notably accrual positions in\nICG \u2019s Markets businesses).\nThese changes resulted in a\nhigher impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income over a\n12-month period.\n\nUnder the enhanced\nmethodology, Citi utilizes the\nmost recent quarter-end\nbalance sheet, assuming no\nchanges to its composition and\nsize over the forecasted\nhorizon (holding the balance\nsheet static). The forecasts\nincorporate expectations and\nassumptions of deposit\npricing, loan spreads and\nmortgage prepayment behavior\nimplied by the interest rate\ncurves in each scenario. The\nbase case scenario reflects\nthe market implied forward\ninterest rates, and\nsensitivity scenarios assume\ninstantaneous shocks to the\nbase case. The forecasts do\nnot assume Citi takes any\nrisk-mitigating actions in\nresponse to changes in the\ninterest rate environment.\nCertain interest rates are\nsubject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities, (i.e., deposit\nbetas), are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior.

The\nestimated impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income in a 100 bps\nupward rate shock scenario as\nof December 31, 2022 decreased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily\nreflecting the net impact of\nlower expected gains due to\nU.S. dollar interest rate\nmoves that have already been\nrealized and changes in Citi\u2019s\nbalance sheet. At\nprogressively higher interest\nrate levels, the marginal net\ninterest income benefit is\nlower, as Citi assumes it will\npass on a larger share of rate\nchanges to depositors (i.e.,\nhigher betas), further\nreducing Citi\u2019s IRE\nsensitivity.

The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d).

For other\ncurrencies, exposure to\ndownward rate shocks is\nsmaller in magnitude as a\nresult of Citi\u2019s flooring\nassumption, given low rate\nlevels for certain non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 as compared to Scenario 3.\nThis is because the\ncombination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                               96                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI\n                                                                \n  and Capital                                                   \n                                                                \nAs of December 31, 2022, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.7 billion,\nor 1.0%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\nMexican peso, Euro, Singapore\ndollar and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency translation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s CET1\nCapital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital as compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

As shown in the\nchart below, positive trading-\nrelated revenue was achieved\nfor 95.4% of the trading days\nin 2022.\n                                                     \n  Daily Trading-Related Revenue (Loss)(1)\u201412 Months  \n  Ended December 31, 2022                            \n  In millions of dollars                             \n                                                     \n(1) Reflects the effects of asymmetrical accounting for economic\nhedges of certain AFS debt securities.

Citi\u2019s Global Market\nRisk function, within the\nIndependent Risk Management\norganization, works to ensure\nthat factor sensitivities are\ncalculated, monitored and\nlimited for all material risks\ntaken in the trading\nportfolios.\n                                                                \n  Value at Risk (VAR)                                           \n                                                                \nVAR estimates, at a 99%\nconfidence level, the\npotential decline in the value\nof a position or a portfolio\nunder normal market conditions\nassuming a one-day holding\nperiod. VAR statistics, which\nare based on historical data,\ncan be materially different\nacross firms due to\ndifferences in portfolio\ncomposition, VAR methodologies\nand model parameters. As a\nresult, Citi believes VAR\nstatistics can be used more\neffectively as indicators of\ntrends in risk-taking within a\nfirm, rather than as a basis\nfor inferring differences in\nrisk-taking across firms.\n\nCiti uses a single,\nindependently approved Monte\nCarlo simulation VAR model\n(see \u201cVAR Model Review and\nValidation\u201d below), which has\nbeen designed to capture\nmaterial risk sensitivities\n(such as first- and second-\norder\n\nsensitivities of positions to\nchanges in market prices) of\nvarious asset classes/risk\ntypes (such as interest rate,\ncredit spread, foreign\nexchange, equity and commodity\nrisks). Citi\u2019s VAR includes\npositions that are measured at\nfair value; it does not\ninclude investment securities\nclassified as AFS or HTM. See\nNote 13 for information on\nthese securities.\n\nCiti believes its VAR model is\nconservatively calibrated to\nincorporate fat-tail scaling\nand the greater of short-term\n(approximately the most recent\nmonth) and long-term (18\nmonths for commodities and\nthree years for others) market\nvolatility. The Monte Carlo\nsimulation involves\napproximately 550,000 market\nfactors, making use of\napproximately 480,000 time\nseries, with sensitivities\nupdated daily, volatility\nparameters updated intra-\nmonthly and correlation\nparameters updated monthly.\nThe conservative features of\nthe VAR calibration contribute\nan approximate 46% add-on to\nwhat would be a VAR estimated\nunder the assumption of stable\nand perfectly, normally\ndistributed markets.\n\nAs presented in the table\nbelow, Citi\u2019s average trading\nVAR increased $22 million from\n2021 to 2022, mainly due to\nincreased market volatility.\nCiti\u2019s average trading and\ncredit portfolio VAR increased\n$23 million from 2021 to 2022\nin line with trading VAR.\n\nYear-end and Average Trading\nVAR and

In addition, product-specific back-testing on\nportfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing\nmodel performance monitoring process and reviewed with Citi\u2019s\nU.S. banking regulators. Furthermore, Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting (as described below) is performed against buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub-portfolios\nacross the organization (trading desk level, ICG operating\nsegment and Citigroup) and the results are shared with U.S.\nbanking regulators. Material VAR model and assumption changes\nmust be independently validated within Citi\u2019s Independent Risk\nManagement organization. All model changes, including those for\nthe VAR model, are validated by the model validation group\nwithin Citi\u2019s Model Risk Management. In the event of significant\nmodel changes, parallel model runs are undertaken prior to\nimplementation. In addition, significant model and assumption\nchanges are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by\nCiti\u2019s U.S. banking regulators. Citi uses the same independently\nvalidated VAR model for both Regulatory VAR and Risk Management\nVAR (i.e., total trading and total trading and credit portfolios\nVARs) and, as such, the model review and validation process for\nboth purposes is as described above. Regulatory VAR, which is\ncalculated in accordance with Basel III, differs from Risk\nManagement VAR due to the fact that certain positions included\nin Risk Management VAR are not eligible for market risk\ntreatment in Regulatory VAR. The\n\ncomposition of Risk Management VAR is discussed under \u201cValue at\nRisk\u201d above. The applicability of the VAR model for positions\neligible for market risk treatment under U.S. regulatory capital\nrules is periodically reviewed and approved by Citi\u2019s U.S.\nbanking regulators. In accordance with Basel III, Regulatory VAR\nincludes all trading book-covered positions and all foreign\nexchange and commodity exposures. Pursuant to Basel III,\nRegulatory VAR excludes positions that fail to meet the intent\nand ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified\nas non-trading book and categories of exposures that are\nspecifically excluded as covered positions. Regulatory VAR\nexcludes CVA on derivative instruments and DVA on Citi\u2019s own\nfair value option liabilities. CVA hedges are excluded from\nRegulatory VAR and included in credit risk-weighted assets as\ncomputed under the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-\nweighted assets. Regulatory VAR Back-Testing In accordance with\nBasel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of its Regulatory VAR model. Regulatory VAR\nback-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a\n99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit\nand loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is\nheld constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following\nday). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-\nmarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in\ncovered positions from the close of the previous business day.\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue,\nnet interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions.\n                              107                               \nThe following graph shows the\ndaily buy-and-hold profit and\nloss associated with Citi\u2019s\ncovered positions compared to\nCiti\u2019s one-day Regulatory VAR\nduring 2022. During 2022, one\nback-testing exception was\nobserved at the Citigroup\nlevel.\n\nThe difference between the\n48.3% of days with buy-and-\nhold gains for Regulatory VAR\nback-testing and the 95.4% of\ndays with trading, net\ninterest and other revenue\nassociated with Citi\u2019s trading\nbusinesses, shown in the\nhistogram of daily trading-\nrelated revenue below,\nreflects, among other things,\nthat a significant portion of\nCiti\u2019s trading-related revenue\nis not generated from daily\nprice movements on these\npositions and exposures, as\nwell as differences in the\nportfolio composition of\nRegulatory VAR and Risk\nManagement VAR.\n                                                      \n  Regulatory Trading VAR and Associated Buy-and-Hold  \n  Profit and Loss(1)\u201412 Months Ended December 31,     \n  2022                                                \n  In millions of dollars                              \n                                                      \n                                                                \n  \u2610Total Regulatory VAR Buy-and-Hold       \u2610Regulatory VAR T-1  \n  P&L                                                           \n                                                                \n(1) Buy-and-hold profit and loss, as defined by the banking\nregulators under Basel III, represents the daily mark-to-market\nrevenue movement attributable to the trading position from the\nclose of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss\nexcludes realized trading revenue and net interest intra-day\ntrading profit and loss on new and terminated trades, as well as\nchanges in reserves. Therefore, it is not comparable to the\ntrading-related revenue presented in the chart of daily trading-\nrelated revenue above.\n                              108                               \n                                                                \n  Stress Testing                                                \n                                                                \nCiti performs market risk\nstress testing on a regular\nbasis to estimate the impact\nof extreme market movements.\nIt is performed on individual\npositions and trading\nportfolios, as well as in\naggregate, inclusive of\nmultiple trading portfolios.\nCiti\u2019s market risk management,\nafter consultations with the\nbusinesses, develops both\nsystemic and specific stress\nscenarios, reviews the output\nof periodic stress testing\nexercises and uses the\ninformation to assess the\nongoing appropriateness of\nexposure levels and limits.\nCiti uses two complementary\napproaches to market risk\nstress testing across all\nmajor risk factors (i.e.,\nequity, foreign exchange,\ncommodity, interest rate and\ncredit spreads): top-down\nsystemic stresses and bottom-\nup business-specific stresses.\nSystemic stresses are designed\nto quantify the potential\nimpact of extreme market\nmovements on an institution-\nwide basis, and are\nconstructed using both\nhistorical periods of market\nstress and projections of\nadverse economic scenarios.\nBusiness-specific stresses are\ndesigned to probe the risks of\nparticular portfolios and\nmarket segments, especially\nthose risks that are not fully\ncaptured in VAR and systemic\nstresses.\n\nThe systemic stress scenarios\nand business-specific stress\nscenarios at Citi are used in\nseveral reports reviewed by\nsenior management and also to\ncalculate internal risk\ncapital for trading market\nrisk. In general, changes in\nmarket values are defined over\na one-year horizon. For the\nmost liquid positions and\nmarket factors, changes in\nmarket values are defined over\na shorter two-month horizon.\nThe limited set of positions\nand market factors whose\nmarket value changes are\ndefined over a two-month\nhorizon are those that in\nmanagement\u2019s judgment have\nhistorically remained very\nliquid during financial\ncrises, even as the trading\nliquidity of most other\npositions and market factors\nmaterially declined.\n                              109                               \n                                                                \n  OPERATIONAL RISK                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nOperational risk is the risk\nof loss resulting from\ninadequate or failed internal\nprocesses or systems,\nincluding human error or\nmisjudgment, or from external\nevents. This includes legal\nrisk, which is the risk of\nloss (including litigation\ncosts, settlements and\nregulatory fines) resulting\nfrom the failure of Citi to\ncomply with laws, regulations,\nprudent ethical standards and\ncontractual obligations in any\naspect of its businesses, but\nexcludes strategic and\nreputation risks. Citi also\nrecognizes the impact of\noperational risk on the\nreputation risk associated\nwith Citi\u2019s business\nactivities.\n\nOperational risk is inherent\nin Citi\u2019s global business\nactivities, as well as related\nsupport functions, and can\nresult in losses. Citi\nmaintains a comprehensive\nCompany-wide risk taxonomy to\nclassify operational risks\nthat it faces using\nstandardized definitions\nacross Citi\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement Framework (see\ndiscussion below). This\ntaxonomy also supports\nregulatory requirements and\nexpectations inclusive of\nthose related to U.S. Basel\nIII, Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR),\nHeightened Standards for Large\nFinancial Institutions and\nDodd-Frank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST).\n\nCiti manages operational risk\nconsistent with the overall\nframework described in\n\u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Overview\u201d above. Citi\u2019s\ngoal is to keep operational\nrisk at appropriate levels\nrelative to the\ncharacteristics of its\nbusinesses, the markets in\nwhich it operates, its capital\nand liquidity and the\ncompetitive, economic and\nregulatory environment. This\nincludes effectively managing\noperational risk and\nmaintaining or reducing\noperational risk exposures\nwithin Citi\u2019s operational risk\nappetite.\n\nCiti\u2019s Independent Operational\nRisk Management group has\nestablished a global\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework with policies and\npractices for identification,\nmeasurement, monitoring,\nmanaging and reporting\noperational risks and the\noverall operating\neffectiveness of the internal\ncontrol environment. As part\nof this framework, Citi has\ndefined its operational risk\nappetite and established a\nmanager\u2019s control assessment\n(MCA) process for self-\nidentification of significant\noperational risks, assessment\nof the performance of key\ncontrols and mitigation of\nresidual risk above acceptable\nlevels.\n\nEach Citi operating segment\nmust implement operational\nrisk processes consistent with\nthe requirements of this\nframework. This includes:\n\n\u2022 understanding the\noperational risks they are\nexposed to;\n\n\u2022 designing controls to\nmitigate identified risks;\n\n\u2022 establishing key indicators;\n\n\u2022 monitoring and reporting\nwhether the operational risk\nexposures are in or out of\ntheir operational risk\nappetite;\n\n\u2022 having processes in place to\nbring operational risk\nexposures within acceptable\nlevels;\n\n\u2022 periodically estimating and\naggregating the operational\nrisks they are exposed to; and\n\n\u2022 ensuring that sufficient\nresources are available to\nactively improve the\noperational risk environment\nand mitigate emerging risks.\n\nCiti considers operational\nrisks that result from the\nintroduction of new or changes\nto existing products, or\nresult from significant\nchanges in its organizational\nstructures, systems, processes\nand personnel.\n\nCiti has a governance\nstructure for the oversight of\noperational risk exposures\nthrough Business Risk and\nControls Committees (BRCCs),\nwhich include a Citigroup\nGlobal BRCC as well as\nbusiness, functions, regional\nand country BRCCs. BRCCs\nprovide escalation channels\nfor senior management to\nreview operational risk\nexposures including breaches\nof operational risk appetite,\nkey indicators, operational\nrisk events and control\nissues. Membership includes\nsenior business and functions\nleadership as well as members\nof the second line of defense.\n\nIn addition, Independent Risk\nManagement, including the\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup, works proactively with\nCiti\u2019s businesses and\nfunctions to drive a strong\nand embedded operational risk\nmanagement culture and\nframework across Citi. The\nOperational Risk Management\ngroup actively challenges\nbusiness and functions\nimplementation of the\nOperational Risk Management\nFramework requirements and the\nquality of operational risk\nmanagement practices and\noutcomes.\n\nInformation about businesses\u2019\nkey operational risks,\nhistorical operational risk\nlosses and the control\nenvironment is reported by\neach major business segment\nand functional area. Citi\u2019s\noperational risk profile and\nrelated information is\nsummarized and reported to\nsenior management, as well as\nto the Audit and Risk\nCommittees of Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors by the Head of\nOperational Risk Management.\n\nOperational risk is measured\nthrough Operational Risk\nCapital and Operational Risk\nRegulatory Capital for the\nAdvanced Approaches under\nBasel III. Projected\noperational risk losses under\nstress scenarios are estimated\nas a required part of the\nFRB\u2019s CCAR process.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s operational risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisk\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Cybersecurity Risk                                            \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Overview                                                      \n                                                                \nCybersecurity risk is the\nbusiness risk associated with\nthe threat posed by a\ncyberattack, cyber breach or\nthe failure to protect Citi\u2019s\nmost vital business\ninformation assets or\noperations, resulting in a\nfinancial or reputational loss\n(for additional information,\nsee the operational processes\nand systems and cybersecurity\nrisk factors in \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). With an evolving\nthreat landscape, ever-\nincreasing sophistication of\nthreat actor tactics,\ntechniques and procedures, and\nuse of new technologies to\nconduct financial\ntransactions, Citi and its\nclients, customers and third\nparties are and will continue\nto be at risk from\ncyberattacks and information\nsecurity incidents. Citi\nrecognizes the significance of\nthese risks and, therefore,\nleverages a threat-focused\nstrategy to protect against,\ndetect and respond to, and\nrecover from cyberattacks.\nFurther, Citi actively\nparticipates in financial\nindustry, government and\ncross-sector knowledge-sharing\ngroups to enhance individual\nand collective cybersecurity\npreparedness and resilience.\n                              110                               \n                                                                \n  Risk Management                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s technology and\ncybersecurity risk management\nprogram is built on three\nlines of defense. Citi\u2019s first\nline of defense under the\nOffice of the Chief\nInformation Security Officer\nprovides frontline business,\noperational and technical\ncontrols and capabilities to\nprotect against cybersecurity\nrisks, and to respond to cyber\nincidents and data breaches.\nCiti manages these threats\nthrough state-of-the-art\nFusion Centers, which serve as\ncentral commands for\nmonitoring and coordinating\nresponses to cyber threats.\nThe enterprise information\nsecurity team is responsible\nfor infrastructure defense and\nsecurity controls, performing\nvulnerability assessments and\nthird-party information\nsecurity assessments, employee\nawareness and training\nprograms and security incident\nmanagement. In each case the\nteam works in coordination\nwith a network of information\nsecurity officers who are\nembedded within the businesses\nand functions globally.\n\nCiti\u2019s Operational Risk\nManagement-Technology and\nCyber (ORM-T/C) and\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement-Technology and\nInformation Security (ICRM-T)\ngroups serve as the second\nline of defense, and actively\nevaluate, anticipate and\nchallenge Citi\u2019s risk\nmitigation practices and\ncapabilities. Citi seeks to\nproactively identify and\nremediate technology and\ncybersecurity risks before\nthey materialize as incidents\nthat negatively affect\nbusiness operations.\nAccordingly, the ORM-T/C team\nindependently challenges and\nmonitors capabilities in\naccordance with Citi\u2019s defined\nTechnology and Cyber Risk\nAppetite statements. To\naddress evolving cybersecurity\nrisks and corresponding\nregulations, ORM-T/C and\nICRM-T teams collectively also\nmonitor cyber legal and\nregulatory requirements,\nidentify and define emerging\nrisks, execute strategic cyber\nthreat assessments, perform\nnew products and initiative\nreviews, perform data\nmanagement risk oversight and\nconduct cyber risk assurance\nreviews (inclusive of third-\nparty assessments). In\naddition, ORM-T/C employs\ntools and oversees and\nchallenges metrics that are\nboth tailored to cybersecurity\nand technology and aligned\nwith Citi\u2019s overall\noperational risk management\nframework to effectively\ntrack, identify and manage\nrisk.\n\nInternal audit serves as the\nthird line of defense and\nindependently provides\nassurance on how effectively\nthe organization as a whole\nmanages cybersecurity risk.\nCiti also has multiple senior\ncommittees such as the\nInformation Security Risk\nCommittee (ISRC), which\ngoverns enterprise-level risk\ntolerance inclusive of\ncybersecurity risk.\n                                                                \n  Board Oversight                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors\nand/or one or more Board\nCommittees provides oversight\nof management\u2019s efforts to\nmitigate cybersecurity risk\nand respond to cyber\nincidents. The Board and/or\none or more Board Committees\nreceives regular reports on\ncybersecurity and engages in\ndiscussions throughout the\nyear with management and\nsubject-matter experts on the\neffectiveness of Citi\u2019s\noverall cybersecurity program.\nThe Board and/or one or more\nBoard Committees also obtains\nupdates on Citi\u2019s inherent\ncybersecurity risks and Citi\u2019s\nroad map and progress for\naddressing these risks.\n\nMoreover, Citi\u2019s Board and its\ncommittee members receive\ncontemporaneous reporting on\nsignificant cyber events\n\nincluding response, legal\nobligations, and outreach and\nnotification to regulators,\nand customers when needed, as\nwell as guidance to management\nas appropriate. On an annual\nbasis, the Board\u2019s Risk\nManagement Committee approved\na standalone Cybersecurity\nRisk Appetite Statement\nagainst which Citi\u2019s\nperformance is measured\nquarterly. For additional\ninformation on the Board\u2019s\noversight of cybersecurity\nrisk management, see Citi\u2019s\nupcoming 2023 Proxy Statement\nto be filed with the SEC in\nMarch 2023.\n                                                                \n  COMPLIANCE RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCompliance risk is the risk to\ncurrent or projected financial\ncondition and resilience\narising from violations of\nlaws, rules, or regulations,\nor from non-conformance with\nprescribed practices, internal\npolicies and procedures or\nethical standards. Compliance\nrisk exposes Citi to fines,\ncivil money penalties, payment\nof damages and the voiding of\ncontracts. Compliance risk can\nresult in diminished\nreputation, harm to Citi\u2019s\ncustomers, limited business\nopportunities and lessened\nexpansion potential. It\nencompasses the risk of\nnoncompliance with all laws\nand regulations, as well as\nprudent ethical standards and\nsome contractual obligations.\nIt could also include exposure\nto litigation (known as legal\nrisk) from all aspects of\ntraditional and non-\ntraditional banking.\n\nCiti seeks to operate with\nintegrity, maintain strong\nethical standards and adhere\nto applicable policies and\nregulatory and legal\nrequirements. Citi must\nmaintain and execute a\nproactive Compliance Risk\nManagement (CRM) Framework (as\nset forth in the CRM Policy)\nthat is designed to manage\ncompliance risk effectively\nacross Citi, with a view to\nfundamentally strengthen the\ncompliance risk management\nculture across the lines of\ndefense taking into account\nCiti\u2019s risk governance\nframework and regulatory\nrequirements. Independent\nCompliance Risk Management\u2019s\n(ICRM) primary objectives are\nto:\n\n\u2022 Drive and embed a culture of\ncompliance and control\nthroughout Citi;\n\n\u2022 Maintain and oversee an\nintegrated CRM Framework that\nfacilitates enterprise-wide\ncompliance with local,\nnational or cross-border laws,\nrules or regulations, Citi\u2019s\ninternal policies, standards\nand procedures and relevant\nstandards of conduct;\n\n\u2022 Assess compliance risks and\nissues across product lines,\nfunctions and geographies,\nsupported by globally\nconsistent systems and\ncompliance risk management\nprocesses; and\n\n\u2022 Provide compliance risk data\naggregation and reporting\ncapabilities.\n\nCiti carries out its\nobjectives and fulfills its\nresponsibilities through the\nCRM Framework, which is\ncomposed of the following\nintegrated key activities, to\nholistically manage compliance\nrisk:\n\n\u2022 Management of Citi\u2019s\ncompliance with laws, rules\nand regulations by identifying\nand analyzing changes,\nassessing the impact, and\nimplementing appropriate\npolicies, processes and\ncontrols;\n                              111                               \n\u2022 Developing and providing\ncompliance training to ensure\ncolleagues are aware of and\nunderstand the key laws, rules\nand regulations;\n\n\u2022 Monitoring the Compliance\nRisk Appetite, which is\narticulated through\nqualitative compliance risk\nstatements describing Citi\u2019s\nappetite for certain types of\nrisk and quantitative measures\nto monitor the Company\u2019s\ncompliance risk exposure;\n\n\u2022 Executing Compliance Risk\nAssessments, the results of\nwhich inform Compliance Risk\nMonitoring and testing of\ncompliance risks and controls\nin assessing conformance with\nlaws, rules, regulations and\ninternal policies; and\n\n\u2022 Issue identification,\nescalation and remediation to\ndrive accountability,\nincluding measurement and\nreporting of compliance risk\nmetrics against established\nthresholds in support of the\nCRM Policy and Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nTo anticipate, control and\nmitigate compliance risk, Citi\nhas established the CRM Policy\nto achieve standardization and\ncentralization of\nmethodologies and processes,\nand to enable more consistent\nand comprehensive execution of\ncompliance risk management.\n\nCiti has a commitment, as well\nas an obligation, to identify,\nassess and mitigate compliance\nrisks associated with its\nbusinesses and functions. ICRM\nis responsible for oversight\nof Citi\u2019s CRM Policy, while\nall businesses and global\ncontrol functions are\nresponsible for managing their\ncompliance risks and operating\nwithin the Compliance Risk\nAppetite.\n\nAs discussed above, Citi is\nworking to address the FRB and\nOCC consent orders, which\ninclude improvements to Citi\u2019s\nCRM Framework and its\nenterprise-wide application\n(for additional information\nregarding the consent orders,\nsee \u201cCiti\u2019s Consent Order\nCompliance\u201d above).\n                                                                \n  REPUTATION RISK                                               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s reputation is a vital\nasset in building trust and\nCiti is diligent in enhancing\nand protecting its reputation\nwith its key stakeholders. To\nsupport this, Citi has\ndeveloped a reputation risk\nframework. Under this\nframework, Citigroup and\nCitibank, N.A. have\nimplemented a risk appetite\nstatement and related key\nindicators to monitor\ncorporate activities and\noperations relative to Citi\u2019s\nrisk appetite. The framework\nalso requires that business\nsegments and regions escalate\npotential material reputation\nrisks that require review or\nmitigation through a\nReputation Risk Committee or\nequivalent.\n\nThe Reputation Risk\nCommittees, which are composed\nof Citi\u2019s senior executives,\ngovern the process by which\nmaterial reputation risks are\nidentified, measured,\nmonitored, controlled and\nreported. The Reputation Risk\nCommittees determine the\nappropriate actions to be\ntaken in line with risk\nappetite and regulatory\nexpectations, while promoting\na culture of risk awareness\nand high standards of\nintegrity and ethical behavior\nacross the Company, consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s Mission and Value\nProposition. The Citigroup\nReputation Risk Committee may\nescalate reputation risks to\nthe Nomination, Governance and\nPublic Affairs Committee or\nother appropriate committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n\nEvery Citi employee is\nresponsible for safeguarding\nCiti\u2019s reputation, guided by\nCiti\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nColleagues are expected to\nexercise sound judgment and\ncommon sense in decisions and\nactions. They are also\nexpected to promptly escalate\nall issues that present\nmaterial reputation risk in\nline with policy.\n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \nAs discussed above, strategic\nrisk is the risk of a\nsustained impact (not episodic\nimpact) to Citi\u2019s core\nstrategic objectives as\nmeasured by impacts on\nanticipated earnings, market\ncapitalization, or capital,\narising from external factors\naffecting the Company\u2019s\noperating environment, as well\nas the risks associated with\ndefining the strategy and\nexecuting the strategy, which\nare identified, measured and\nmanaged as part of the\nStrategic Risk Framework at\nthe Enterprise Level.\n\nIn this context, external\nfactors affecting Citi\u2019s\noperating environment are the\neconomic environment,\ngeopolitical/political\nlandscape,\nindustry/competitive\nlandscape, societal trends,\ncustomer/client behavior,\nregulatory/legislative\nenvironment and trends related\nto investors/shareholders.\n\nCiti\u2019s Executive Management\nTeam is responsible for the\ndevelopment and execution of\nCiti\u2019s strategy. This strategy\nis translated into forward-\nlooking plans (collectively\nCiti\u2019s Strategic Plan) that\nare then cascaded across the\norganization. Citi\u2019s Strategic\nPlan is presented to the Board\non an annual basis, and is\naligned with risk appetite\nthresholds and includes a risk\nassessment as required by\ninternal frameworks. It is\nalso aligned with limit\nrequirements for capital\nallocation. Governance and\noversight of strategic risk is\nfacilitated by internal\ncommittees on a group-wide\nbasis as well as strategic\ncommittees at the operating\nsegment and regional levels.\n\nCiti works to ensure that\nstrategic risks are adequately\nconsidered and addressed\nacross its various risk\nmanagement activities, and\nthat strategic risks are\nassessed in the context of\nCiti\u2019s risk appetite. Citi\nconducts a top-down, bottom-up\nrisk identification process to\nidentify risks, including\nstrategic risks. Business\nsegments undertake a quarterly\nrisk identification process to\nsystematically identify and\ndocument all material risks\nfaced by Citi. Independent\nRisk Management oversees the\nrisk identification process\nthrough regular reviews and\ncoordinates identification and\nmonitoring of top risks. In\naddition, Citi performs a\nquarterly Risk Assessment of\nthe Plan (RAOP) and\ncontinuously monitors risks\nassociated with its execution\nof strategy. Independent Risk\nManagement also manages\nstrategic risk by monitoring\nrisk appetite thresholds in\nconjunction with various\nstrategic risk committees,\nwhich are part of the\ngovernance structure that Citi\nhas in place to manage its\nstrategic risks.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s strategic risks, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d\nabove.\n                                                                \n  Climate Risk                                                  \n                                                                \nClimate change presents\nimmediate and long-term risks\nto Citi and its clients and\ncustomers, with the risks\nexpected to increase over\ntime. Climate risk refers to\nthe risk of loss arising from\nclimate change and comprises\nboth physical risk and\ntransition risk. Physical risk\nconsiders how chronic and\nacute climate change (e.g.,\nincreased storms, drought,\nfires, floods) can directly\ndamage physical assets (e.g.,\nreal estate,\n                              112                               \ncrops) or otherwise impact\ntheir value or productivity.\nTransition risk considers how\nchanges in policy, technology,\nbusiness practices and market\npreferences to address climate\nchange (e.g., carbon pricing\npolicies, power generation\nshifts from fossil fuels to\nrenewable energy) can lead to\nchanges in the value of\nassets, commodities and\ncompanies.\n\nClimate risk is an overarching\nrisk that can act as a driver\nof other categories of risk,\nsuch as credit risk from\nobligors exposed to high\nclimate risk, strategic risks\nif Citi fails to consider\ntransition risk in client\nselection, reputational risk\nfrom increased stakeholder\nconcerns about financing high-\ncarbon industries and\noperational risk from physical\nrisks to Citi\u2019s facilities and\npersonnel. Citi\u2019s focus on\nclimate risk continues to\nincrease, driven by\nmateriality of strategic,\nreputational and financial\nrisk considerations. Citi\ncontinues to make progress\ntoward embedding these\nconsiderations into its\noverarching risk management\napproach. For additional\ninformation on climate risk,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Strategic\nRisks\u201d above.\n\nCiti reviews factors related\nto climate risk under its\nEnvironmental and Social Risk\nManagement (ESRM) Policy,\nwhich includes a focus on\nclimate risk related to\nfinanced projects and clients\nin high-carbon sectors.\nConsidering the credit risk of\nstranded assets, as well as\nthe reputational risks\nassociated with the coal\nsector due to its high-carbon\nemissions, Citi\u2019s ESRM Policy\nincludes a prohibition on all\nproject-related financing of\nnew coal-fired power plants\nand new or expanding thermal\ncoal mines, as well as\ntimetables to reduce financing\nof companies with high\nexposure to coal-fired power\nand coal mining that do not\npursue low-carbon transition\nin the coming years. These\nsector approaches set clear\nexpectations for clients and\nhelp address certain climate\nrisk-driven credit risk\nconcerns while reducing\nreputation risk.\n\nCiti continues to explore and\ntest methodologies for\nquantifying how climate risks\ncould impact the individual\ncredit profiles of its clients\nacross various sectors. To\nassist in embedding climate\nrisk assessments in its credit\nassessment process, Citi has\ndeveloped sector-specific\nclimate risk assessments. Such\nclimate risk assessments are\ndesigned to supplement\npublicly available client\ndisclosures and data provided\nfrom third-party vendors and\nfacilitate conversations with\nclients on their most material\nclimate risks and management\nplans for adaptation and\nmitigation. Citi\u2019s assessments\nconsider sectors that have\nbeen identified as higher\nclimate risk by its risk\nidentification process. This\nwill help Citi better\nunderstand its clients\u2019\nbusinesses and climate-related\nrisks. Citi\u2019s Net Zero plan is\nleading to the further\nintegration of climate risk\ndiscussions into client\nengagement and client\nselection.\n\nCiti continues to develop\nglobally consistent principles\nand approaches for managing\nclimate risk across the\nCompany through the\nimplementation of its Climate\nRisk Management Framework.\nThrough this implementation,\nclimate risk is being embedded\ninto relevant policies and\nprocesses over time.\n\nFurthermore, Citi continues to\nparticipate in financial\nindustry initiatives and\ndevelop and pilot new\nmethodologies and approaches\nfor measuring and assessing\nthe potential financial risks\nof climate change. Citi also\ncontinues to monitor\nregulatory developments on\nclimate risk and\n\nsustainable finance and\nactively engage with\nregulators on these topics.\n\nFor additional information\nabout sustainability and other\nESG matters at Citi, see\n\u201cSustainability and Other ESG\nMatters\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  OTHER RISKS                                                   \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  LIBOR Transition Risk                                         \n                                                                \nAs previously disclosed, the\nLIBOR administrator ceased\npublication of non-USD LIBOR\nand one-week and two-month USD\nLIBOR on a permanent or\nrepresentative basis on\nDecember 31, 2021, with plans\nfor all other USD LIBOR tenors\nto permanently cease or become\nnon-representative after June\n30, 2023. As a result, Citi\nceased entering into new\ncontracts referencing USD\nLIBOR as of January 1, 2022,\nother than for limited\ncircumstances where regulators\nrecognized that it may be\nappropriate for banks to enter\ninto new USD LIBOR contracts,\nincluding with respect to\nmarket-making, hedging or\nnovations of USD transactions\nexecuted before January 1,\n2022. (For information about\nrisks to Citi from a\ntransition away from and\ndiscontinuation of LIBOR or\nany other benchmark rates, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d\nabove.)\n\nDuring 2022, Citi continued\nits efforts to manage its\nLIBOR transition risks. Citi\nhas been focused on further\nreducing its LIBOR exposure\nand remediating its remaining\noutstanding LIBOR-linked\ncontracts. In addition, Citi\nhas continued to monitor and\nengage on legislative,\nregulatory and other\ninitiatives and developments\nrelated to LIBOR transition\nmatters.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Citi\nhad a USD LIBOR-linked gross\nnotional exposure of\napproximately $7.1 trillion\nthat matures after the LIBOR\ncessation date of June 30,\n2023, of which approximately\n$7 trillion relates to\nderivatives. This derivatives\nexposure includes (i)\nbilateral derivatives with a\ngross notional of\napproximately $2.5 trillion of\nwhich 96% is already\nremediated through inclusion\nof ISDA fallbacks and (ii)\ncleared derivatives with a\ngross notional of\napproximately $4.5 trillion\nthat will be covered by the\nCentral Counterparty Clearing\nHouse (CCP) conversions\nplanned for the second quarter\nof 2023.\n\nThe remaining gross notional\nof approximately $0.15\ntrillion relates to cash\nproducts (e.g., loans, debt\nsecurities, preferred stock\nand securitizations), which\nCiti continues to address\nthrough active conversion or\ninsertion of robust contract\nfallback language or is\ncovered by legislative\nsolutions such as the\nAdjustable Interest Rate\n(LIBOR) Act (see the\ndiscussion below). Due to\nrounding, USD LIBOR-linked\nderivatives and cash products\nexposure may not sum to total\nUSD LIBOR-linked gross\nnotional exposure.\n\nIn the U.S., the LIBOR Act\nprovides for the use of a\nstatutory replacement for the\novernight, one-month, three-\nmonth, six-month and 12-month\ntenors of USD LIBOR in all\ncontracts governed by U.S. law\nthat lack adequate fallback\nprovisions. As required by the\nLIBOR Act, each proposed\nreplacement rate, which\ndiffers depending on product\ntype, is based on the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate\n(SOFR). Citi\u2019s USD LIBOR-\nlinked securities and\ncontracts that do not have\nadequate fallbacks as\ndescribed in the LIBOR Act and\n                              113                               \nthat are governed by U.S. law\nwill fall within the\napplication of the LIBOR Act.\nAs a result, USD LIBOR in\nthese contracts will be\nreplaced with SOFR plus the\napplicable spread adjustment.\n\nCiti is focused on remediating\ncontracts that reference the\nUSD LIBOR Ice Swap Rate and\nnon-U.S. law contracts, which\nare not covered by the LIBOR\nAct. As of December 31, 2022,\nCiti had a USD LIBOR Ice Swap\nRate gross notional exposure\nof approximately $0.17\ntrillion. This includes\napproximately $0.16 trillion\nof bilateral derivatives, of\nwhich 79% has already been\nremediated through inclusion\nof ISDA fallbacks, and\napproximately $0.01 trillion\nof debt securities that Citi\nis addressing through its\nremediation action plans. The\nUSD LIBOR Ice Swap Rate is a\nseparate rate from USD LIBOR\nand is not included in the USD\nLIBOR-linked gross notional\nexposure.\n\nOn November 23, 2022, the FCA\nproposed the publication of\none-, three- and six-month USD\nLIBOR on a synthetic basis\nthrough September 2024, which\nwould provide additional time\nfor non-U.S.-law-governed\ncontracts and any contracts\nthat reference the USD LIBOR\nIce Swap Rate to be remediated\nor mature.\n\nFurther, Citi continued to\nengage with regulators,\nfinancial accounting bodies\nand others on LIBOR transition\nmatters. This included\nparticipating in a number of\nworking groups, including the\nAlternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (ARRC) convened by\nthe FRB, to promote and\nadvance development of SOFR\nand seek to identify and\naddress potential challenges\nfrom LIBOR transition.\n\nCiti has also continued to use\nalternative reference rates in\ncertain newly issued financial\ninstruments. Citi has issued\nfloating rate benchmark and\ncustomer-related debt linked\nto SOFR and originated and\narranged loans linked to SOFR.\nCiti\u2019s derivatives contracts\nare predominantly linked to\nSOFR and other global\nalternative reference rates.\nCiti also provides term SOFR-\nlinked products to clients in\naccordance with industry best\npractices and recommendations.\n                              114                               \n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of December 31, 2022.\n(Including the U.S., the total\nexposure as of December 31,\n2022 to the top 25 countries\nwould represent approximately\n98% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower. For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries, most\nsignificantly in the United\nKingdom (U.K.) and Ireland,\n\nin order to more efficiently\nserve its corporate customers.\nAs an example, with respect to\nthe U.K., only 38% of\ncorporate loans presented in\nthe table below are to U.K.\ndomiciled entities (40% for\nunfunded commitments), with\nthe balance of the loans\npredominately to European\ndomiciled counterparties.\nApproximately 90% of the total\nU.K. funded loans and 89% of\nthe total U.K. unfunded\ncommitments were investment\ngrade as of December 31, 2022.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

This removal was due\nto the inability to conclude, with a well-founded basis, the\nenforceability of contractual rights in the Russian legal system\nin the event of a counterparty default, given the geopolitical\nuncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. As this exposure was\nalready included in Total third-party exposure, the Total Russia\nexposure was not impacted by this reclassification.\n\n(3) Unfunded exposure consists of unfunded corporate lending\ncommitments, letters of credit and other contingencies.\n\n(4) Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the\nCentral Bank of Russia.\n\n(5) Represents dividends received by Citi in its role as\ncustodian for investor clients in Russia. Citi is unable to\nremit these funds to clients due to restrictions imposed by the\nRussian government.\n\n(6) The majority of AO Citibank\u2019s third-party exposures was\nfunded with domestic deposit liabilities from both corporate and\npersonal banking clients.\n\n(7) Citigroup\u2019s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its\nindirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above\ntable, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would\nbe recognized in Citigroup\u2019s earnings upon either the\nsubstantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank.\nCiti has separately described these risks in \u201cDeconsolidation\nRisk\u201d below.\n                              116                               \nDuring the fourth quarter of\n2022, Citi continued to reduce\nits operations in Russia and\nRussia-related exposures,\nresulting in a net decrease in\ntotal Russia exposure of $0.4\nbillion, shown in the table\nabove, as well as a change in\nthe composition of its\nexposure as mitigation efforts\nhave reduced Citi\u2019s third-\nparty credit risk. The\nsequential decline in exposure\nwas driven by a $1.3 billion\ndecrease due to depreciation\nof the ruble against the U.S.\ndollar and a $0.9 billion\ndecrease due to loan\nrepayments and sales,\npartially offset by a $1.8\nbillion increase in local\ncurrency terms, driven by\ndividends received by Citi as\ncustodian for investor clients\nin Russia that Citi is unable\nto remit due to restrictions\nimposed by the Russian\ngovernment.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued risk\nmitigation efforts include ICG\nborrower paydowns and limiting\nextensions of new credit. ICG\n\u2019s credit exposure also\nreflected a shift to a higher\nproportion of stronger credit\nnames, including a higher\nproportion of subsidiaries of\nmultinational companies that\nare headquartered outside of\nRussia, primarily in the U.S.\nand Europe. The decline in\noverall exposure was also\ndriven by a reduction in\nexposures to Russian\ncounterparties not held by AO\nCitibank.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $1.2\nbillion as of December 31,\n2022 (compared to $1.3 billion\nas of September 30, 2022). The\ndecrease was primarily driven\nby a $0.2 billion decrease due\nto depreciation of the ruble\nagainst the U.S. dollar,\npartially offset by an\nincrease of $0.1 billion in\nretained earnings. A portion\nof Citi\u2019s net investment was\nhedged for foreign currency\ndepreciation as of December\n31, 2022, using forward\nforeign exchange contracts\nexecuted with international\npeer banks.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ICG , PBWM and Legacy\nFranchises segments and\nCorporate/Other have been\nimpacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\nand its direct and indirect\nimpact on the European and\nglobal economies. For a\nbroader discussion of these\nfactors and volatilities on\nCiti\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$0.3 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct and\nindirect Russian\ncounterparties (down from $0.5\nbillion at September 30,\n2022).\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nIn August 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer and local\ncommercial banking businesses,\nincluding actively pursuing\nportfolio sales. In connection\nwith the wind-down plan, Citi\nincurred $22 million\n(excluding the impact from any\nportfolio sales) of costs in\n2022.\n\nIn October 2022, Citi\nannounced that it will be\nending nearly all of the\ninstitutional banking services\nit offers in Russia by the end\nof the first quarter of 2023.\nGoing forward, Citi\u2019s only\noperations in Russia will be\nthose necessary to fulfill its\nremaining legal and regulatory\nobligations.\n\nOn October 28, 2022, Citi\nentered into an agreement to\nsell a portfolio of ruble-\ndenominated personal\ninstallment loans, totaling\napproximately $240 million in\noutstanding loan\n\nbalances as of the fourth\nquarter of 2022, to Uralsib, a\nRussian commercial bank. Citi\nclosed the sale in December\n2022 and incurred a pretax net\nloss of approximately $12\nmillion as a result. In\nconnection with the portfolio\nsale, Citi also entered into a\nreferral agreement to settle\nto Uralsib a portfolio of\nruble-denominated credit card\nloans, subject to customer\nconsents. The outstanding card\nloans balance was\napproximately $219 million as\nof the fourth quarter of 2022.\nCiti will refer credit card\ncustomers, who at the\ncustomers\u2019 sole discretion\nwill be eligible to refinance\ntheir outstanding card loan\nbalances with Uralsib.\n\nAt this time, Citi expects to\nincur estimated costs of\napproximately $190 million in\nconnection with its consumer\nand institutional wind-down\nplans in Russia, primarily\nthrough 2024 ($80 million in\nICG and $110 million in Legacy\nFranchises ). For additional\ninformation, see \u201c\nInstitutional Clients Group \u201d\nand \u201c Legacy Franchises \u201d\nabove.\n                                                                \n  Deconsolidation Risk                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s operations in Russia\nsubject it to various risks,\nincluding, among others,\nforeign currency volatility,\nincluding appreciations or\ndevaluations; restrictions\narising from retaliatory\nRussian laws and regulations\non the conduct of its\nbusiness; sanctions or asset\nfreezes; or other\ndeconsolidation events (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d\nabove). Examples of triggers\nthat may result in\ndeconsolidation of AO Citibank\ninclude voluntary or forced\nsale of ownership or loss of\ncontrol due to actions of\nrelevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, Citi\ncontinued to consolidate AO\nCitibank because none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nIn the event of a loss of\ncontrol of AO Citibank, Citi\nwould be required to (i) write\noff the net investment of\napproximately $1.2 billion\n(compared to $1.3 billion as\nof September 30, 2022), (ii)\nrecognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.3 billion\nthrough earnings (compared to\n$1.0 billion as of September\n30, 2022) and (iii) recognize\na loss of $0.5 billion\n(compared to $0.3 billion as\nof September 30, 2022) on\nintercompany liabilities owed\nby AO Citibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.3 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients              \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/\n                              117                               \ndealers) that have clients who\nare investors in the\napplicable bonds (i.e.,\nbondholders). As a paying\nagent, Citi generally does not\nhave information about the\nidentity of the bondholders.\nCiti may be exposed to risks\ndue to its responsibilities\nfor receiving and processing\npayments on behalf of its\nclients as a result of\nsanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions. To mitigate\noperational and sanctions\nrisks, Citi has established\npolicies, procedures and\ncontrols for client\nrelationships and payment\nprocessing to help ensure\ncompliance with U.S., U.K., EU\nand other jurisdictions\u2019\nsanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto accounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or block\nthe funds until applicable\nsanctions are lifted or the\npayment is otherwise\nauthorized under applicable\nlaw.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its current presence\nin Russia and association with\nRussian individuals or\nentities, whether subject to\nsanctions or not, including\nCiti\u2019s inability to support\nits global clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses. Citi has\nconsidered the potential for\nreputation risk and taken\nactions to mitigate such\nrisks. Citi established a\nRussia Special Review Process\nwith management\u2019s Reputation\nRisk Committee with oversight\nfor significant Russia-related\nreputation risks and completed\na number of reputation risk\nreviews of matters with a\nRussian nexus.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities\n\nin the country, cessation of\nnew business and client\noriginations, and reduction of\nother exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations. For\nadditional information on\noperational and cyber risks,\nsee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Operational\nRisk\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  Board\u2019s Role in Overseeing Related Risks                      \n                                                                \nThe Citi Board of Directors\n(Board) and the Board\u2019s Risk\nManagement Committee (RMC) and\nits other Committees have\nreceived and continue to\nreceive regular reports from\nsenior management regarding\nthe war in Ukraine and its\nimpact on Citi\u2019s operations in\nRussia, Ukraine and elsewhere,\nas well as the war\u2019s broader\ngeopolitical, macroeconomic\nand reputational impacts. In\naddition to receiving regular\nbriefings from management, the\nfull Board has routinely been\ninvited to attend portions of\nthe RMC meetings for\ndiscussions related to the war\nin Ukraine, including with\nrespect to Citi\u2019s risk\nexposures and stress testing.\nThe reports to the Board and\nits Committees from senior\nmanagement who represent the\nimpacted businesses and the\nEMEA region, Independent Risk\nManagement, Finance,\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement, including those\nindividuals responsible for\nsanctions compliance, and\nHuman Resources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                              118                               \n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its ICG businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 230\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety is Citi\u2019s top priority.\n\nAll of Citi\u2019s domestic\noperations in Ukraine are\nconducted through a subsidiary\nof Citibank, which uses the\nUkrainian hryvnia as its\nfunctional currency. Citi\u2019s\nexposures in Ukraine are not\nsignificant enough to be\nincluded in the \u201cTop 25\nCountry Exposures\u201d table\nabove. As of December 31,\n2022, these exposures amounted\nto $1.0 billion, unchanged\nfrom September 30, 2022, and\nwere exclusively composed of\nthird-party assets held on the\nCiti Ukraine subsidiary.\n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its ICG businesses. As\nof December 31, 2022, Citi\u2019s\nnet investment in its\nArgentine operations was\napproximately $1.7 billion.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, Citi uses the\nU.S. dollar as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\ncountries that are deemed\nhighly inflationary. Citi uses\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate to remeasure its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets into the U.S. dollar.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the\nofficial Argentine peso\nexchange rate against the U.S.\ndollar was 177.15.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nCentral Bank of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat restrict Citi\u2019s ability\nto access U.S. dollars in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nAs a result, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations is likely to\ncontinue to increase as Citi\ngenerates net income in its\nArgentine franchise and its\nearnings cannot be remitted.\n\nDue to the currency controls\nimplemented by the Central\nBank of Argentina, certain\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms have developed that\nsome Argentine entities may\nuse to obtain U.S. dollars,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. However, if\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate converges with the\napproximate rate implied by\nthe indirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms, Citi could incur a\nloss on its capital in\nArgentina. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of December\n31, 2022, the international\nNDF market had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\u2019s\ninability to economically\nhedge its Argentine peso\nexposure. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute NDF contracts for this\nunhedged exposure in the\nfuture, Citi would record\ndevaluations on its net\nArgentine peso\u2010denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nany benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished an appropriate ACL\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of December\n31, 2022. However, U.S.\nregulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s emerging markets risks,\nincluding those related to its\nArgentine exposures, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n\nFFIEC\u2014Cross-Border Claims on\nThird Parties and Local\nCountry Assets\n\nCiti\u2019s cross-border\ndisclosures are presented\nbelow, based on the country\nexposure bank regulatory\nreporting guidelines of the\nFederal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC).\nThe following summarizes some\nof the key FFIEC reporting\nguidelines:\n\n\u2022 Amounts are based on the\ndomicile of the ultimate\nobligor, counterparty,\ncollateral (only including\nqualifying liquid collateral),\nissuer or guarantor, as\napplicable (e.g., a security\nrecorded by a Citi U.S. entity\nbut issued by the U.K.\ngovernment is considered U.K.\nexposure; a loan recorded by a\nCiti Mexico entity to a\ncustomer domiciled in Mexico\nwhere the underlying\ncollateral is held in Germany\nis considered German\nexposure).\n\n\u2022 Amounts do not consider the\nbenefit of collateral received\nfor secured financing\ntransactions (i.e., repurchase\nagreements, reverse repurchase\nagreements and securities\nloaned and borrowed) and are\nreported based on notional\namounts.\n\n\u2022 Netting of derivative\nreceivables and payables,\nreported at fair value, is\npermitted, but only under a\nlegally binding netting\nagreement with the same\nspecific counterparty, and\ndoes not include the benefit\nof margin received or hedges.\n\n\u2022 Credit default swaps (CDS)\nare included based on the\ngross notional amount sold and\npurchased and do not include\nany offsetting CDS on the same\nunderlying entity.\n\n\u2022 Loans are reported without\nthe benefit of hedges.\n\nGiven the requirements noted\nabove, Citi\u2019s FFIEC cross-\nborder exposures and total\noutstandings tend to\nfluctuate, in some cases\nsignificantly, from period to\nperiod. As an example, because\ntotal outstandings under FFIEC\nguidelines do not include the\nbenefit of margin or hedges,\nmarket volatility in interest\nrates, foreign exchange rates\nand credit spreads may cause\nsignificant fluctuations in\nthe level of total\noutstandings, all else being\nequal.\n                              119                               \nThe tables below show each country whose total outstandings\nexceeded 0.75% of total Citigroup assets:\n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                           $    \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                                                                \n(1) Non-bank financial institutions.\n\n(2) Included in total outstanding.\n\n(3) Total outstanding includes cross-border claims on third\nparties, as well as local country assets.

Note 1 contains a\nsummary of all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. These policies, as\nwell as estimates made by\nmanagement, are integral to\nthe presentation of Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition. While all\nof these policies require a\ncertain level of management\njudgment and estimates, this\nsection highlights and\ndiscusses the significant\naccounting policies that\nrequire management to make\nhighly difficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d\nabove). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\ndrivers to the valuation of an\ninstrument and the degree of\nilliquidity and subsequent\nlack of observability in\ncertain markets. The fair\nvalue of these instruments is\nreported on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nwith the changes in fair value\nrecognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome.

In\naddition, Citi reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables. These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover an R&S timeframe. The R&S\nforecast period for consumer\nand corporate loans is eight\nquarters.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The\n\nqualitative management\nadjustment component reflects\nrisks and current economic\nconditions not captured in the\nquantitative component. Both\nthe quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default (PD),\nloss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD). The\nloss likelihood and severity\nmodels used for estimating\nexpected credit losses are\nsensitive to changes in\nmacroeconomic variables,\nincluding housing prices,\nunemployment and real GDP, and\ncover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency,\n                              122                               \nrisk ratings and loss recovery\nrates, as well as other credit\ntrends. Qualitative Component\nThe qualitative management\nadjustment component includes\nrisks not fully captured in\nthe quantitative component, as\nrequired by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL, including, but not\nlimited to: \u2022 Concentrations\nand collateral valuation risk\nwith obligors in the global\nportfolio \u2022 Emerging\nmacroeconomic risks due to\nuncertainties related to the\nwar in Ukraine, potential\nglobal recession, inflation,\ninterest rates, commodity\nprices and potential impacts\non vulnerable industries and\nregions \u2022 Normalization of\nportfolio performance and\nconsumer behavior from record\nlow losses as a result of\ngovernment stimulus and market\nliquidity Citi\u2019s qualitative\ncomponent declined year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by the\nincorporation of multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios in the\nquantitative component and\nreleases of COVID-19\u2013related\nuncertainty reserves as the\nportfolio continues to\nnormalize toward pre-pandemic\nlevels and as these risks are\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent of the ACL.\nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nconsiders a multitude of\nglobal macroeconomic variables\nfor the base, upside and\ndownside probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL.

Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 4Q22, U.S. real GDP growth\nis expected to decline during\n2023, and the unemployment\nrate is expected to increase\nmodestly over the forecast\nhorizon, broadly returning to\npre-pandemic levels. Scenario\nWeighting Citi\u2019s ACL is\nestimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario. For example,\ncompared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nreflects a more severe\nrecession, including an\nelevated average U.S.\nunemployment rate of 6.9% over\nthe eight-quarter R&S period,\nwith a peak difference of 2.9%\nin the second quarter of 2024.\nThe downside scenario also\nreflects a year-over-year U.S.\nreal GDP contraction in 2023\nof 2.4%, with a peak quarter-\nover-quarter difference of\n3.3% in the second quarter of\n2023. Citi\u2019s ACL is sensitive\nto the various macroeconomic\nscenarios that drive the\nquantitative component of\nexpected credit losses due to\nchanges in the length and\nseverity of forecasted\neconomic variables or events\nin the respective scenarios.\nTo demonstrate this\nsensitivity, Citi applied 100%\nweight to the downside\nscenario as of December 31,\n2022 to reflect the most\nsevere economic deterioration\nforecast in the multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe weighted scenario\nassumptions; therefore,\napplying a 100% downside\nscenario weight would result\nin a hypothetical increase in\nthe ACL of approximately $4.2\nbillion related to lending\nexposures, except for loans\nindividually evaluated for\ncredit losses. This analysis\ndoes not incorporate any\nimpacts or changes to the\nqualitative component of the\nACL. These factors could\ndecrease the outcome of the\nsensitivity analysis based on\nhistorical experience and\ncurrent conditions at the time\nof the assessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of December 31,\n2022.\n                              123                               \n4Q22 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below, in\nthe fourth quarter of 2022,\nCiti had an ACL build of $0.7\nbillion for its consumer\nportfolios and a release of\n$0.1 billion for its corporate\nportfolios, for a net ACL\nbuild of $0.6 billion. The\nbuild was primarily driven by\ncards loan growth in consumer\nportfolios and a deterioration\nin macroeconomic assumptions\n(see \u201cMacroeconomic Variables\u201d\nabove), partially offset by\nreductions in Russia exposures\n(see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Russia\u201d\nabove). Based on its latest\nmacroeconomic forecast, Citi\nbelieves its analysis of the\nACL reflects the forward view\nof the economic environment as\nof December 31, 2022. See Note\n15 for additional information.\n\nConsumer\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. Cards\nin U.S. Personal Banking. As\ndiscussed above, Citi\u2019s total\nconsumer ACLL build was $0.7\nbillion in the fourth quarter\nof 2022, primarily driven by\nU.S. Cards loan growth and a\ndeterioration in macroeconomic\nassumptions, which increased\nthe ACLL balance to $14.1\nbillion, or 3.84% of total\nfunded consumer loans.\n\nFor U.S. Cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans increased to\n7.56% as of December 31, 2022,\ncompared to 7.53% at September\n30, 2022. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to total\nfunded loans was 1.3% at\nDecember 31, 2022, unchanged\nfrom September 30, 2022.\n\nCorporate\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nrelease of $0.1 billion in the\nfourth quarter of 2022. The\nrelease was primarily driven\nby the reduction of direct\nexposures in Russia, partially\noffset by the deterioration of\nmacroeconomic assumptions.\nIncluding FX/Other, the ACLL\nreserve balance decreased $93\nmillion to $2.9 billion, or\n1.01% of total funded\ncorporate loans.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC build of $47\nmillion in the fourth quarter\nof 2022, which increased the\nACLUC reserve balance,\nincluded in Other liabilities\n, to $2.2 billion. The build\nwas primarily driven by a\ndeterioration in macroeconomic\nassumptions.\n                                                                \n  ACL on Other Financial Assets                                 \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACL build on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost of $5 million\nin the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIncluding FX/Other, the ACL\nreserve balance decreased $13\nmillion to $0.2 billion,\nincluded in Other assets.

In addition, the\nratio of non-accrual loans to\ntotal loans was 0.39% and\n0.36% for corporate and\nconsumer loans, respectively,\nat December 31, 2022 (for\nadditional information on non-\naccrual loans, see \u201cAdditional\nConsumer and Corporate Credit\nDetails\u2014Non-Accrual Loans and\nAssets and Renegotiated Loans\u201d\nabove).\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti elected the modified CECL\ntransition provision for\nregulatory capital purposes\nprovided by the U.S. banking\nagencies\u2019 final rule.\nAccordingly, the Day One\nregulatory capital effects\nresulting from the adoption of\nCECL, as well as the ongoing\nadjustments for 25% of the\nchange in CECL-based\nallowances in each quarter\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021, started to\nbe phased in on January 1,\n2022 and will be fully\nreflected in Citi\u2019s regulatory\ncapital as of January 1, 2025.\n\nSee Notes 1 and 15 for a\nfurther description of the ACL\nand related accounts.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually and\nconducts interim assessments\nbetween annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more-likely-\nthan-not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its\ncarrying amount. These events\nor circumstances include,\namong other things, a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsustained decrease in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nCiti had historically\nperformed its annual goodwill\nimpairment test as of July 1\neach year. During the quarter\nended September 30, 2022, the\nCompany voluntarily changed\nits annual impairment\nassessment date from July 1 to\nOctober 1. Based on interim\nimpairment tests performed\nbetween the previous annual\ntest on July 1, 2021 and the\nannual test to be performed on\nOctober 1, 2022, no more than\n12 months have elapsed between\ngoodwill impairment tests of\nany of Citi\u2019s reporting units.\nThe change in measurement date\nrepresents a change in method\nof applying an accounting\nprinciple. This change is\npreferable because it better\naligns the Company\u2019s goodwill\nimpairment testing procedures\nwith its annual planning\nprocess and with its fiscal\nyear-end. Citi continues to\nmonitor each reporting unit\nfor triggering events for\npurposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. The change\nin accounting principle did\nnot result in any delay,\nacceleration or avoidance of\nan impairment charge. During\nthe fourth quarter of 2022,\nthe annual test was performed,\nwhich resulted in no goodwill\nimpairment as described in\nNote 16.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022,\nCitigroup\u2019s activities were\nconducted through the\nInstitutional Clients Group ,\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement and Legacy\nFranchises operating segments\nand Corporate/Other . Goodwill\nimpairment testing is\nperformed at the level below\nthe business segment (referred\nto as a reporting unit).\n\nCiti utilizes allocated equity\nas a proxy for the carrying\nvalue of its reporting units\nfor purposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. The\nallocated equity in the\nreporting units is determined\nbased on the capital the\nbusiness would require\n                              124                               \nif it were operating as a\nstandalone entity,\nincorporating sufficient\ncapital to be in compliance\nwith both current and expected\nregulatory capital\nrequirements, including\ncapital for specifically\nidentified goodwill and\nintangible assets. The capital\nallocated to the reporting\nunits is incorporated into the\nannual budget process, which\nis approved by Citi\u2019s Board of\nDirectors.\n\nGoodwill impairment testing\ninvolves management judgment,\nrequiring an assessment of\nwhether the carrying value of\na reporting unit can be\nsupported by its fair value,\nusing widely accepted\nvaluation techniques, such as\nthe market approach (earnings\nmultiples and/or transaction\nmultiples) and/or the income\napproach (discounted cash flow\n(DCF) method). In applying\nthese methodologies, Citi\nutilizes a number of factors,\nincluding actual operating\nresults, future business\nplans, economic projections\nand market data. Where\napplicable, bids from buyers\nare also utilized to determine\nfair value.\n\nSimilar to 2021, Citi engaged\nan independent valuation\nspecialist in 2022 to assist\nin Citi\u2019s valuation of all the\nreporting units, primarily\nemploying both the income and\nmarket approach to determine\nthe fair value of the\nreporting units. Bids from\nbuyers were also used, where\navailable. The resulting fair\nvalues were relatively\nconsistent and appropriate\nweighting was given to outputs\nfrom the income and market\napproach valuations. The\nincome approach utilized\ndiscount rates that Citi\nbelieves adequately reflected\nthe risk and uncertainty in\nthe financial markets in the\ninternally generated cash flow\nprojections.\n\nThe income approach employs a\ncapital asset pricing model in\nestimating the discount rate.\nSince none of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units are publicly\ntraded, individual reporting\nunit fair value determinations\ncannot be directly correlated\nto Citigroup\u2019s common stock\nprice. The sum of the fair\nvalues of the reporting units\nexceeded the overall market\ncapitalization of Citi as of\nOctober 1, 2022. However, Citi\nbelieves that it is not\nmeaningful to reconcile the\nsum of the fair values of the\nCompany\u2019s reporting units to\nits market capitalization due\nto several factors. The market\ncapitalization of Citigroup\nreflects the execution risk in\na transaction involving\nCitigroup due to its size.\nHowever, the individual\nreporting units\u2019 fair values\nare not subject to the same\nlevel of execution risk nor a\nbusiness model that is as\ninternational. In addition,\nthe market capitalization of\nCitigroup does not include\nconsideration of the\nindividual reporting unit\u2019s\ncontrol premium.\n\nAs discussed in Note 3,\neffective January 1, 2022, as\npart of its strategic refresh,\nCiti made changes to its\nmanagement structure, which\nresulted in changes in its\noperating segments and\nreporting units to reflect how\nthe CEO, who is the chief\noperating decision maker,\nmanages the Company, including\nallocating resources and\nmeasuring performance.\nGoodwill balances were\nreallocated across the new\nreporting units based on their\nrelative fair values using the\nvaluation performed as of the\neffective date of the\nreorganization. Further, the\ngoodwill balances associated\nwith certain Asia Consumer\nbusinesses within the Legacy\nFranchises operating segment\nwere reclassified to HFS as of\nMarch 31, 2022. See Note 2 for\na discussion of Citi\u2019s\ndivestiture activities.\n\nThe reorganization of Citi\u2019s\nmanagement structure and the\nannounced sales of businesses\nwithin the Legacy Franchises\noperating segment were\nidentified as triggering\nevents for purposes of\ngoodwill impairment testing.\nConsistent with the\nrequirements of ASC 350,\ninterim goodwill impairment\ntests were performed that\nresulted in an impairment of\n$535 million to the Asia\nConsumer reporting unit within\nthe Legacy Franchises\noperating segment, due to the\nimplementation of Citi\u2019s\nrevised operating segments and\nreporting units, as well as\nthe timing of mutual execution\nof sale agreements for certain\nof the Asia consumer banking\nbusinesses. This impairment\nwas recorded in the first\nquarter of 2022 as an\noperating expense.\n\nDuring the second quarter of\n2022, Citi\u2019s Banking reporting\nunit within the ICG operating\nsegment was negatively\nimpacted by the industry-wide\ndecline in investment banking\nactivity and macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties.\nThese conditions resulted in a\ncorresponding decline in the\noperating results of the\nBanking reporting unit as of\nJune 30, 2022, and were\nidentified as a triggering\nevent for purposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. Consistent\nwith the requirements of ASC\n350, an interim goodwill\nimpairment test was performed\nthat resulted in no impairment\nof the Banking reporting unit\nwithin the ICG operating\nsegment.\n\nDuring the third quarter of\n2022, Citi\u2019s Banking reporting\nunit within the ICG operating\nsegment continued to be\nnegatively impacted by the\nindustry-wide decline in\ninvestment banking activity\namid ongoing macroeconomic\nchallenges and uncertainties.\nThe presence of these\nconditions was identified as a\ntriggering event for the\npurposes of goodwill\nimpairment testing. Consistent\nwith the requirements of ASC\n350, an interim goodwill\nimpairment test was performed\nthat resulted in no impairment\nof the Banking reporting unit.\n\nAlso, during the third quarter\nof 2022, Citi performed an\ninterim goodwill impairment\ntest on the Mexico Consumer/\nSBMM reporting unit as of July\n1, 2022 to satisfy the\nrequirement that no more than\n12 months elapse between the\ntests for all reporting units.\nThe test resulted in no\nimpairment as the fair value\nof the Mexico Consumer/SBMM\nreporting unit was greater\nthan its carrying value.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of\n2022, Citi performed its\nannual goodwill impairment\ntest as of October 1, 2022,\nwhich resulted in no\nimpairment. The result of the\nimpairment test showed that\nthe fair value of Citi\u2019s\nreporting units exceeded their\ncarrying value for all\nreporting units. The fair\nvalue of two reporting units\n(Banking and Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM) ranged from\n102% to 106% of their carrying\nvalues. The carrying values of\nthe Banking and Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM reporting units\nincluded approximately $1.5\nbillion and $1 billion of\ngoodwill, respectively. The\nfair values of Citi\u2019s other\nreporting units as a\npercentage of their carrying\nvalues ranged from\napproximately 111% to 277%.\n\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations of the reporting\nunits, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as Citi\u2019s management\nimplements its strategic\nrefresh. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimates of key\neconomic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment\n                              125                               \ncharges in the future. See\nNotes 1 and 16 for additional\ninformation on goodwill,\nincluding the changes in the\ngoodwill balance year-over-\nyear and the segments\u2019\ngoodwill balances as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\n                                                                \n  Litigation Accruals                                           \n                                                                \nSee the discussion in Note 29\nfor information regarding\nCiti\u2019s policies on\nestablishing accruals for\nlitigation and regulatory\ncontingencies.\n                                                                \n  Income Taxes                                                  \n                                                                \nOverview\n\nCiti is subject to the income\ntax laws of the U.S., its\nstates and local\nmunicipalities and the\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions in\nwhich Citi operates. These tax\nlaws are complex and are\nsubject to differing\ninterpretations by the\ntaxpayer and the relevant\ngovernmental taxing\nauthorities. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax\nlaws may be subject to review\nand adjudication by the court\nsystems of the various tax\njurisdictions or may be\nsettled with the taxing\nauthority upon audit.\n\nIn establishing a provision\nfor income tax expense, Citi\nmust make judgments and\ninterpretations about the\napplication of these\ninherently complex tax laws.\nCiti must also make estimates\nabout when in the future\ncertain items will affect\ntaxable income in the various\ntax jurisdictions, both\ndomestic and foreign. Deferred\ntaxes are recorded for the\nfuture consequences of events\nthat have been recognized in\nthe financial statements or\ntax returns, based upon\nenacted tax laws and rates.\nDeferred tax assets (DTAs) are\nrecognized subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment that\nrealization is more-likely-\nthan-not. For example, if it\nis more-likely-than-not that a\ncarry-forward would expire\nunused, Citi would set up a\nvaluation allowance (VA)\nagainst that DTA. Citi has\nestablished valuation\nallowances as described below.\n\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act (Tax Reform),\nbeginning in 2018, Citi is\ntaxed on income generated by\nits U.S. operations at a\nfederal tax rate of 21%. The\neffect on Citi\u2019s state tax\nrate is dependent upon how and\nwhen the individual states\nthat have not yet addressed\nthe federal tax law changes\nchoose to adopt the various\nnew provisions of the U.S.\nInternal Revenue Code.\n\nCiti\u2019s non-U.S. branches and\nsubsidiaries are subject to\ntax at their local tax rates.\nNon-U.S. branches also\ncontinue to be subject to U.S.\ntaxation. The impact of this\non Citi\u2019s earnings depends on\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate and allocations of\noverall domestic loss (ODL)\nand expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to branch earnings.\nCiti expects no residual U.S.\ntax on such earnings. With\nrespect to non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries, dividends from\nthese subsidiaries are\nexcluded from U.S. taxation.\nWhile the majority of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. subsidiary earnings\nare classified as Global\nIntangible Low Taxed Income\n(GILTI), Citi expects no\nmaterial residual U.S. tax on\nsuch earnings based on its\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 local\ntax rates, which exceed, on\naverage, the GILTI tax rate.\nFinally, Citi does not expect\nthe Base Erosion Anti-Abuse\nTax (BEAT) to affect its tax\nprovision.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, final\nforeign tax credit (FTC)\nregulations were published in\nthe Federal Register. These\n\nregulations eliminate the\ncreditability of foreign taxes\npaid in certain situations.\nThese include countries that\ndo not align with U.S. tax\nprinciples in significant part\nand for services performed\noutside the recipient country.\nThe impact on Citi\u2019s 2022\neffective tax rate was not\nmaterial.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act,\nsigned into law on August 16,\n2022, had no impact on Citi\u2019s\n2022 results. The Act includes\na new corporate alternative\nminimum tax (AMT) and a 1%\nexcise tax on stock buybacks,\nboth effective January 1,\n2023. The corporate AMT is a\n15% minimum tax on financial\nstatement income after\nadjusting for foreign taxes\npaid. Corporate AMT paid in\none year is creditable against\nregular corporate tax\nliability in future years.\nCiti does not expect to pay\nmaterial amounts of corporate\nAMT given its profitability\nand tax profile.\n\nThe 1% excise tax is a non-\ndeductible tax on the fair\nmarket value of stock\nrepurchased in the taxable\nyear, reduced by the fair\nmarket value of any stock\nissued in the same year, and\nis accounted for in equity.\n                                                                \n  Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances (VA)             \n                                                                \nAt December 31, 2022, Citi had\nnet DTAs of $27.7 billion. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2022,\nCiti\u2019s DTAs increased by $0.6\nbillion, primarily as a result\nof losses in Other\ncomprehensive income . On a\nfull-year basis, Citi\u2019s DTAs\nincreased by $2.9 billion from\n$24.8 billion at December 31,\n2021.\n\nOf Citi\u2019s total net DTAs of\n$27.7 billion as of December\n31, 2022, $10.9 billion,\nprimarily related to tax\ncarry-forwards, was deducted\nin calculating Citi\u2019s\nregulatory capital. Net DTAs\narising from temporary\ndifferences are deducted from\nregulatory capital if in\nexcess of the 10%/15%\nlimitations (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d above). For the\nquarter and year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, Citi had\n$0.3 billion of disallowed\ntemporary difference DTAs\n(included in the $10.9 billion\nabove). The remaining $16.8\nbillion of net DTAs as of\nDecember 31, 2022 was not\ndeducted in calculating\nregulatory capital pursuant to\nBasel III standards, and was\nappropriately risk weighted\nunder those rules.\n\nCiti\u2019s total VA at December\n31, 2022 was $2.4 billion, a\ndecrease of $1.8 billion from\n$4.2 billion at December 31,\n2021. The decrease was\nprimarily driven by a release\nof the remaining general\nbasket FTC VA and expirations\nin the FTC branch basket.\nCiti\u2019s VA of $2.4 billion is\ncomposed of $0.9 billion on\nits FTC branch basket carry-\nforwards, $1.0 billion on its\nU.S. residual DTA related to\nits non-U.S. branches, $0.4\nbillion on local non-U.S. DTAs\nand $0.1 billion on state net\noperating loss carry-forwards.\n\nAs stated above with regard to\nthe impact of non-U.S.\nbranches on Citi\u2019s earnings,\nthe level of branch pretax\nincome, the local branch tax\nrate and the allocations of\nODL and expenses for U.S. tax\npurposes to the branch basket\nare the main factors in\ndetermining the branch VA. The\nallocated ODL was enhanced by\nsignificant taxable income\ngenerated in the current year.\n\nCiti\u2019s VA against FTC carry-\nforwards in its general basket\nwas fully reversed in 2022\nfrom $0.8 billion in 2021,\nprimarily as a result of the\neffect of higher interest\nrates on the projections of\nfuture interest income. See\nNote 9.\n\nRecognized FTCs comprised\napproximately $1.9 billion of\nCiti\u2019s DTAs as of December 31,\n2022, compared to\n                              126                               \napproximately $2.8 billion as\nof December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease in FTCs year-over-\nyear was primarily due to\ncurrent-year usage, net of the\nVA release. The FTC carry-\nforward period represents the\nmost time-sensitive component\nof Citi\u2019s DTAs.\n\nCiti had an ODL of\napproximately $8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022, which\nallows it to elect a\npercentage between 50% and\n100% of future years\u2019 domestic\nsource income to be\nreclassified as foreign source\nincome. (See Note 9 for a\ndescription of the ODL.)\n\nThe majority of Citi\u2019s U.S.\nfederal net operating loss\ncarry-forward and all of its\nNew York State and New York\nCity net operating loss carry-\nforwards are subject to a\ncarry-forward period of 20\nyears. This provides enough\ntime to fully utilize the net\nDTAs pertaining to these\nexisting net operating loss\ncarry-forwards. This is due to\nCiti\u2019s forecast of sufficient\nU.S. taxable income and the\ncontinued taxation of Citi\u2019s\nnon-U.S. income by New York\nState and the City of New\nYork.\n\nAlthough realization is not\nassured, Citi believes that\nthe realization of its\nrecognized net DTAs of $27.7\nbillion at December 31, 2022\nis more-likely-than-not, based\nupon management\u2019s expectations\nof future taxable income in\nthe jurisdictions in which the\nDTAs arise, as well as\navailable tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC\nTopic 740, Income Taxes ).\nCiti has concluded that it has\nthe necessary positive\nevidence to support the\nrealization of its net DTAs\nafter taking its VAs into\nconsideration.\n\nSee Note 9 for additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s income\ntaxes, including its income\ntax provision, tax assets and\nliabilities and a tabular\nsummary of Citi\u2019s net DTAs\nbalance as of December 31,\n2022 (including the FTCs and\napplicable expiration dates of\nthe FTCs).

Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nCiti\u2019s management assessed the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022 based on the\ncriteria set forth by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO) in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework\n(2013) . Based on this\nassessment, management\nbelieves that, as of December\n31, 2022, Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was effective. In\naddition, there were no\nchanges in Citi\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting during the fiscal\nquarter ended December 31,\n2022 that materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n\nThe effectiveness of Citi\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022 has been\naudited by KPMG LLP, Citi\u2019s\nindependent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in\ntheir report below, which\nexpressed an unqualified\nopinion on the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\n                              129                               \n                                                                \n  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                    \n                                                                \nCertain statements in this\nreport, including but not\nlimited to statements included\nwithin the Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and\nResults of Operations, are\n\u201cforward-looking statements\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995. In\naddition, Citigroup also may\nmake forward-looking\nstatements in its other\ndocuments filed with or\nfurnished to the SEC, and its\nmanagement may make forward-\nlooking statements orally to\nanalysts, investors,\nrepresentatives of the media\nand others.\n\nGenerally, forward-looking\nstatements are not based on\nhistorical facts but instead\nrepresent Citigroup\u2019s and its\nmanagement\u2019s beliefs regarding\nfuture events. Such statements\nmay be identified by words\nsuch as believe, expect,\nanticipate, intend, estimate,\nmay increase, may fluctuate,\ntarget and illustrative, and\nsimilar expressions or future\nor conditional verbs such as\nwill, should, may, would and\ncould.\n\nSuch statements are based on\nmanagement\u2019s current\nexpectations and are subject\nto risks, uncertainties and\nchanges in circumstances.\nActual results of operations\nand financial conditions\nincluding capital and\nliquidity may differ\nmaterially from those included\nin these statements due to a\nvariety of factors, including\nwithout limitation (i) the\nprecautionary statements\nincluded within the \u201cExecutive\nSummary\u201d and each individual\nbusiness\u2019s discussion and\nanalysis of its results of\noperations and (ii) the\nfactors listed and described\nunder \u201cRisk Factors\u201d above.\n\nAny forward-looking statements\nmade by or on behalf of\nCitigroup speak only as to the\ndate they are made, and Citi\ndoes not undertake to update\nforward-looking statements to\nreflect the impact of\ncircumstances or events that\narise after the forward-\nlooking statements were made.\n                              130                               \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT\nREGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING\nFIRM\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board\nof Directors\n\nCitigroup Inc.:\n\nOpinions on the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the\naccompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of Citigroup\nInc. and subsidiaries (the\nCompany) as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, the related\nconsolidated statements of\nincome, comprehensive income,\nchanges in stockholders\u2019\nequity, and cash flows for\neach of the years in the\nthree-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and the\nrelated notes (collectively,\nthe consolidated financial\nstatements). We also have\naudited the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl \u2013 Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nIn our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements referred to above\npresent fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the\nfinancial position of the\nCompany as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, and the results\nof its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the years in\nthe three-year period ended\nDecember 31, 2022, in\nconformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. Also in our\nopinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting as of December 31,\n2022 based on criteria\nestablished in Internal\nControl \u2013 Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is\nresponsible for these\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, for maintaining\neffective internal control\nover financial reporting, and\nfor its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting, included in the\naccompanying management\u2019s\nannual report on internal\ncontrols over financial\nreporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on\nthe Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements and an\nopinion on the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting based on\nour audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in\naccordance with the standards\nof the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free\nof material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud,\nand whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting was maintained in\nall material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included\nperforming procedures to\nassess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to\nthose risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the\naccounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as\nevaluating the overall\npresentation of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements. Our audit of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing\nthe risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other\nprocedures as we considered\nnecessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that\nour audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our\nopinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of\nInternal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting is a\nprocess designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for\nexternal purposes in\naccordance with generally\naccepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that,\nin reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit\npreparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of\nthe company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the\ncompany\u2019s assets that could\nhave a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent\nlimitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the\ndegree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters\ncommunicated below are matters\narising from the current\nperiod audit of the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements that were\ncommunicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements and (2) involved\nour especially\n                              131                               \nchallenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical\naudit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical\naudit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\n\nAssessment of the fair value\nof certain Level 3 assets and\nliabilities measured on a\nrecurring basis\n\nAs described in Notes 1, 6, 25\nand 26 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the\nCompany\u2019s net assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis\nwere $840.9 billion and $360.1\nbillion, respectively at\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company\nestimated the fair value of\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities\nmeasured on a recurring basis\n($15.8 billion and $46.5\nbillion, respectively at\nDecember 31, 2022) utilizing\nvarious valuation techniques\nwith one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers being unobservable\nincluding, but not limited to,\ncomplex internal valuation\nmodels, alternative pricing\nprocedures or comparables\nanalysis and discounted cash\nflows.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the measurement of fair\nvalue for certain Level 3\nassets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis as a critical\naudit matter. A high degree of\neffort, including specialized\nskills and knowledge, and\nsubjective and complex auditor\njudgment was involved in the\nassessment of the Level 3 fair\nvalues due to measurement\nuncertainty. Specifically, the\nassessment encompassed the\nevaluation of the fair value\nmethodology, including\nmethods, models and\nsignificant assumptions and\ninputs used to estimate fair\nvalue. Significant assumptions\ninclude proxy data, forecast\ndata, the extrapolation and\ninterpolation of proxy data,\nforecast data, and historic\ndata as well as certain model\nassumptions. The assessment\nalso included an evaluation of\nthe conceptual soundness and\nperformance of the valuation\nmodels.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We involved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge who\nassisted in evaluating the\ndesign and testing the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s Level\n3 fair value measurements\nincluding controls over:\n\n\u2022 valuation methodologies,\nincluding significant inputs\nand assumptions\n\n\u2022 independent price\nverification\n\n\u2022 evaluating that significant\nmodel assumptions and inputs\nreflected those which a market\nparticipant would use to\ndetermine an exit price in the\ncurrent market environment\n\n\u2022 the valuation models used\nwere mathematically accurate\nand appropriate to value the\nfinancial instruments and\n\n\u2022 relevant information used\nwithin the Company\u2019s models\nthat was reasonably available\nwas considered in the fair\nvalue determination.\n\nAssessment of the allowance\nfor credit losses collectively\nevaluated for impairment\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 15\nto the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Company\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses\nwas $19.1 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022, which\nincludes the allowance related\nto loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments collectively\nevaluated for impairment (the\ncollective ACLL). The expected\ncredit losses for the\nquantitative component of the\ncollective ACLL is the product\nof multiplying the probability\nof default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD), and exposure at\ndefault (EAD) for consumer and\ncorporate loans. For consumer\nU.S. credit cards, the Company\nuses the payment rate approach\nover the life of the loan,\nwhich leverages payment rate\ncurves, to determine the\npayments that should be\napplied to liquidate the end-\nof-period balance in the\nestimation of EAD. For\nunconditionally cancelable\naccounts, reserves are based\non the expected life of the\nbalance as of the evaluation\ndate and do not include any\nundrawn commitments that are\nunconditionally cancelable.\nThe credit loss factors\napplied are determined based\non three macroeconomic\nscenarios (base, downside and\nupside) multiplied by their\nrespective scenario\nprobability weights, that take\ninto consideration both\ninternal and external\nforecasted macroeconomic\nvariables, the most\nsignificant of which are U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real\ngross domestic product (GDP).\nAdditionally, for consumer\nU.S. credit card loans, these\nmodels consider leading credit\nindicators including loan\ndelinquencies, as well as\neconomic factors. For\ncorporate loans, these models\nconsider the credit quality as\nmeasured by risk ratings and\neconomic factors. The\nqualitative component\nconsiders idiosyncratic events\nand the uncertainty of\nforward-looking economic\nscenarios.\n\nWe identified the assessment\nof the collective ACLL,\nspecifically for consumer U.S.\ncredit cards and corporate\nportfolios as a critical audit\nmatter. Auditing the\nassessment involved\nsignificant measurement\nuncertainty requiring complex\nauditor judgment, and\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge as well as\nexperience in the industry.\nOur assessment encompassed the\nevaluation of the various\ncomponents of the collective\nACLL methodology, including\nthe methods and models used to\nestimate the PD, LGD, and EAD\nand certain key assumptions\nand inputs for the Company\u2019s\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Key assumptions\nand inputs for consumer loans\nincluded loan delinquencies,\ncertain credit indicators,\nreasonable and supportable\nforecasts, expected life as\nwell as economic factors,\nincluding unemployment rates,\nGDP, and housing prices which\nare considered in the model.\nFor corporate loans, key\nassumptions and inputs\nincluded risk ratings,\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast, credit conversion\nfactor for unfunded lending\ncommitments, and economic\nfactors, including GDP and\nunemployment rate considered\nin the model. Key assumptions\nand inputs for the qualitative\ncomponent for consumer U.S.\ncredit card loans include the\nexpected normalization in\nportfolio performance and\nconsumer behavior, after lower\nlosses observed as a result of\ngovernment stimulus and market\nliquidity. Key\n                              132                               \nassumptions and inputs for the\nqualitative component for\ncorporate loan portfolios\ninclude uncertainty around the\nwar in Ukraine and global\nrecession, considering\nmacroeconomic and market\nfactors, including inflation,\ninterest rates and commodity\nprices and their impacts on\nindustries and sectors that\nare considered more\nvulnerable. The assessment\nalso included an evaluation of\nthe conceptual soundness and\nperformance of the PD, LGD,\nand EAD models. In addition,\nauditor judgment was required\nto evaluate the sufficiency of\naudit evidence obtained.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s\nmeasurement of the collective\nACLL estimate, including\ncontrols over the:\n\n\u2022 approval of the collective\nACLL methodologies\n\n\u2022 determination of the key\nassumptions and inputs used to\nestimate the quantitative and\nqualitative components of the\ncollective ACLL\n\n\u2022 performance monitoring of\nthe PD, LGD, and EAD models.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s\nprocess to develop the\ncollective ACLL estimate by\ntesting certain sources of\ndata and assumptions that the\nCompany used and considered\nthe relevance and reliability\nof such data and assumptions.\nIn addition, we involved\ncredit risk professionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n\n\u2022 reviewing the Company\u2019s\ncollective ACLL methodologies\nand key assumptions for\ncompliance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n\n\u2022 assessing the conceptual\nsoundness and performance\ntesting of the PD, LGD, and\nEAD models by inspecting the\nmodel documentation to\ndetermine whether the models\nare suitable for their\nintended use\n\n\u2022 evaluating judgments made by\nthe Company relative to the\ndevelopment and performance\nmonitoring testing of the PD,\nLGD, and EAD models by\ncomparing them to relevant\nCompany-specific metrics\n\n\u2022 assessing the conceptual\nsoundness and performance\ntesting of the macroeconomic\nscenario weights model by\ninspecting the model\ndocumentation to determine\nwhether the model is suitable\nfor its intended use\n\n\u2022 assessing the economic\nforecast scenarios through\ncomparison to publicly\navailable forecasts\n\n\u2022 evaluating the methodologies\nused to develop certain\neconomic forecast scenarios by\ncomparing it to relevant\nindustry practices\n\n\u2022 testing corporate loan risk\nratings for a selection of\nborrowers by evaluating the\nfinancial performance of the\nborrower, sources of\nrepayment, and any relevant\nguarantees or underlying\ncollateral\n\n\u2022 evaluating the methodologies\nused in determining the\nqualitative components and the\neffect of that component on\nthe collective ACLL compared\nwith\n\nrelevant credit risk factors\nand consistency with credit\ntrends.\n\nWe also assessed the\nsufficiency of the audit\nevidence obtained related to\nthe collective ACLL by\nevaluating the:\n\n\u2022 cumulative results of the\naudit procedures\n\n\u2022 qualitative aspects of the\nCompany\u2019s accounting practices\n\n\u2022 potential bias in the\naccounting estimates.\n\nEvaluation of goodwill in the\nICG Banking and PBWM US PB\nreporting units\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 16\nto the consolidated financial\nstatements, the goodwill\nbalance as of December 31,\n2022 was $19.7 billion, of\nwhich $9.7 billion related to\nreporting units within the\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement (PBWM) segment,\n$9.0 billion related to\nreporting units within the\nInstitutional Clients Group\n(ICG) segment, and $1.0\nbillion related to reporting\nunits within the Legacy\nFranchises segment. The\nCompany performs goodwill\nimpairment testing on an\nannual basis and whenever\nevents or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that\nthe carrying value of a\nreporting unit likely exceeds\nits fair value. This involves\nestimating the fair value of\nthe reporting units using both\ndiscounted cash flow analyses\nand a market multiples\napproach.\n\nWe identified the evaluation\nof the goodwill impairment\nanalysis for the ICG Banking\nand PBWM United States\nPersonal Banking reporting\nunits, one of the three\nreporting units within the ICG\nsegment and one of the two\nreporting units in the PBWM\nsegment, as a critical audit\nmatter. The estimated fair\nvalue of the ICG Banking and\nPBWM United States Personal\nBanking reporting units\nmarginally exceeded their\ncarrying values, indicating a\nhigher risk due to measurement\nuncertainty that the goodwill\nmay be impaired and,\ntherefore, involved a high\ndegree of subjective auditor\njudgment. Specifically, the\nassessment encompassed the\nevaluation of the key\nassumptions used in estimating\nthe fair value of the ICG\nBanking and PBWM United States\nPersonal Banking reporting\nunits, which include the long-\nterm growth rate, discount\nrate, exit multiple\nassumptions, certain\nforecasted macroeconomic\nassumptions used to inform the\nforecasted income by reporting\nunit, and forecasted revenues\nand operating expenses by\nreporting unit used in the\ndiscounted cash flow analyses.\n\nThe following are the primary\nprocedures we performed to\naddress this critical audit\nmatter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the\noperating effectiveness of\ncertain internal controls\nrelated to the Company\u2019s\ndetermination of the estimated\nfair value of the ICG Banking\nand PBWM United States\nPersonal Banking reporting\nunits, including controls\nrelated to management\u2019s\nprocess for assessing the\nappropriateness of:\n\n\u2022 certain assumptions\nincluding the long-term growth\nrate, discount rate and exit\nmultiple assumptions used in\nthe discounted cash flow\nanalyses\n                              133                               \n\u2022 certain forecasted\nmacroeconomic assumptions used\nto inform the forecasted\nincome by reporting unit\n\n\u2022 forecasted revenues and\noperating expenses by\nreporting unit.\n\nWe compared the Company\u2019s\nhistorical forecasts to actual\nresults at a consolidated\nlevel to assess the Company\u2019s\nability to accurately forecast\nkey metrics such as revenues\nand operating expenses. We\nalso compared prior year\nactuals to the expected trends\nfor revenues and operating\nexpenses at the reporting unit\nlevel to assess the Company\u2019s\nability to achieve their\nforecasts. We compared the\nCompany\u2019s fourth quarter 2022\nforecasts to actual fourth\nquarter 2022 results at the\nreporting unit level to assess\nthe Company\u2019s ability to\naccurately forecast. We\nevaluated the reasonableness\nof the Company\u2019s forecasts by\ncomparing to analyst reports.\n\nIn addition, we involved a\nvaluation professional with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                 \n                                                                \nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and the\n\u201cCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the\naccounts of Citigroup and its\nsubsidiaries prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n(GAAP). The Company\nconsolidates subsidiaries in\nwhich it holds, directly or\nindirectly, more than 50% of\nthe voting rights or where it\nexercises control. Entities in\nwhich the Company holds 20% to\n50% of the voting rights\nand/or has the ability to\nexercise significant\ninfluence, other than\ninvestments of designated\nventure capital subsidiaries\nor investments accounted for\nat fair value under the fair\nvalue option, are accounted\nfor under the equity method,\nand the pro rata share of\ntheir income (loss) is\nincluded in Other revenue .\nIncome from investments in\nless-than-20%-owned companies\nis recognized when dividends\nare received. As discussed in\nmore detail in Note 22,\nCitigroup also consolidates\nentities deemed to be variable\ninterest entities when\nCitigroup is determined to be\nthe primary beneficiary. Gains\nand losses on the disposition\nof branches, subsidiaries,\naffiliates, buildings and\nother investments are included\nin Other revenue . Citibank\nCitibank, N.A. (Citibank) is a\ncommercial bank and indirect\nwholly owned subsidiary of\nCitigroup. Citibank\u2019s\nprincipal offerings include\ninvestment banking, commercial\nbanking, cash management,\ntrade finance and e-commerce;\nprivate banking products and\nservices; consumer finance,\ncredit cards, and mortgage\nlending; and retail banking\nproducts and services.\nVariable Interest Entities\n(VIEs) An entity is a variable\ninterest entity (VIE) if it\nmeets either of the criteria\noutlined in Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC)\nTopic 810, Consolidation ,\nwhich are (i) the entity has\nequity that is insufficient to\npermit the entity to finance\nits activities without\nadditional subordinated\nfinancial support from other\nparties, or (ii) the entity\nhas equity investors that\ncannot make significant\ndecisions about the entity\u2019s\noperations or that do not\nabsorb their proportionate\nshare of the entity\u2019s expected\nlosses or expected returns.\nThe Company consolidates a VIE\nwhen it has both the power to\ndirect the activities that\nmost significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and\na right to receive benefits or\nthe obligation to absorb\nlosses of the entity that\ncould be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE (that\nis, Citi is the primary\nbeneficiary). In addition to\nvariable interests held in\nconsolidated VIEs, the Company\nhas variable interests in\nother\n\nVIEs that are not consolidated\nbecause the Company is not the\nprimary beneficiary. All\nunconsolidated VIEs are\nmonitored by the Company to\nassess whether any events have\noccurred to cause its primary\nbeneficiary status to change.\nAll entities not deemed to be\nVIEs with which the Company\nhas involvement are evaluated\nfor consolidation under other\nsubtopics of ASC 810.See Note\n22 for more detailed\ninformation. Foreign Currency\nTranslation Assets and\nliabilities of Citi\u2019s foreign\noperations are translated from\ntheir respective functional\ncurrencies into U.S. dollars\nusing period-end spot foreign\nexchange rates. The effects of\nthose translation adjustments\nare reported in Accumulated\nother comprehensive income\n(loss) (AOCI) , a component of\nstockholders\u2019 equity, net of\nany related hedge and tax\neffects, until realized upon\nsale or substantial\nliquidation of the foreign\nentity, at which point such\namounts are reclassified into\nearnings. Revenues and\nexpenses of Citi\u2019s foreign\noperations are translated\nmonthly from their respective\nfunctional currencies into\nU.S. dollars at amounts that\napproximate weighted average\nexchange rates. For\ntransactions that are\ndenominated in a currency\nother than the functional\ncurrency, including\ntransactions denominated in\nthe local currencies of\nforeign operations that use\nthe U.S. dollar as their\nfunctional currency, the\neffects of changes in exchange\nrates are primarily included\nin Principal transactions ,\nalong with the related effects\nof any economic hedges.\nInstruments used to hedge\nforeign currency exposures\ninclude foreign currency\nforward, option and swap\ncontracts and, in certain\ninstances, designated issues\nof non-U.S.-dollar debt.\nForeign operations in\ncountries with highly\ninflationary economies\ndesignate the U.S. dollar as\ntheir functional currency,\nwith the effects of changes in\nexchange rates primarily\nincluded in Other revenue .\nInvestment Securities\nInvestments include debt and\nequity securities. Debt\nsecurities include bonds,\nnotes and redeemable preferred\nstocks, as well as certain\nloan-backed and structured\nsecurities that are subject to\nprepayment risk. Equity\nsecurities include common and\nnonredeemable preferred stock.\nDebt Securities \u2022 Debt\nsecurities classified as\n\u201cheld-to-maturity\u201d (HTM) are\nsecurities that the Company\nhas both the ability and the\nintent to hold until maturity\nand are carried at amortized\ncost. Interest income on such\nsecurities is included in\nInterest revenue . \u2022 Debt\nsecurities classified as\n\u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d (AFS) are\ncarried at fair value with\nchanges in fair value reported\nin Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) ,\na component of stockholders\u2019\nequity, net of applicable\nincome taxes and hedges.\nInterest income on such\nsecurities is included in\nInterest revenue .\n                              145                               \nFor investments in debt securities classified as HTM or AFS, the\naccrual of interest income is suspended for investments that are\nin default or for which it is likely that future interest\npayments will not be made as scheduled. Investment securities\nnot measured at fair value through earnings include (i) debt\nsecurities held in HTM or AFS, (ii) equity securities accounted\nfor under the Measurement Alternative or equity method, (iii)\nFederal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and (iv)\ncertain exchange memberships. These securities are subject to\nevaluation for impairment as described in Note 15 for HTM\nsecurities and in Note 13 for AFS, Measurement Alternative and\nequity method investments. Realized gains and losses on sales of\ninvestments are included in earnings, primarily on a specific\nidentification basis. The Company uses a number of valuation\ntechniques for investments carried at fair value, which are\ndescribed in Note 25. Equity Securities \u2022 Marketable equity\nsecurities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecognized in earnings. \u2022 Non-marketable equity securities are\nmeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in\nearnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or\n(ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal\nHome Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to\nbe carried at cost. Non-marketable equity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are carried at cost less impairment (if\nany), plus or minus changes resulting from observed prices for\norderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment\nof the same issuer. \u2022 Certain investments that would otherwise\nhave been accounted for using the equity method are carried at\nfair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings,\nsince the Company elected to apply fair value accounting.\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities Trading account assets\ninclude debt and marketable equity securities, derivatives in a\nreceivable position, residual interests in securitizations and\nphysical commodities inventory. In addition, as described in\nNote 26, certain assets that Citigroup has elected to carry at\nfair value under the fair value option, such as loans and\npurchased guarantees, are also included in Trading account\nassets . Trading account liabilities include securities sold,\nnot yet purchased (short positions) and derivatives in a net\npayable position, as well as certain liabilities that Citigroup\nhas elected to carry at fair value (as described in Note 26).\nOther than physical commodities inventory, all trading account\nassets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Revenues\ngenerated from trading assets and trading liabilities are\ngenerally reported in Principal transactions and include\nrealized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses\nresulting from changes in the fair value of such instruments.\nInterest income on trading assets is recorded in Interest\nrevenue reduced by interest expense on trading liabilities.\nPhysical commodities inventory is carried at the lower of cost\nor market with related losses reported in Principal transactions\n, except when included in a hedging relationship. Realized gains\nand losses on sales of commodities inventory are included in\nPrincipal transactions . Investments in unallocated precious\nmetals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and palladium) are\naccounted for as hybrid instruments containing a debt host\ncontract and an embedded non-financial derivative instrument\nindexed to the price of the relevant precious metal. The\nembedded derivative instrument and debt host contract are\ncarried at fair value under the fair value option, as described\nin Note 26. Derivatives used for trading purposes include\ninterest rate, currency, equity, credit and commodity swap\nagreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial\nand commodity futures and forward contracts. Derivative asset\nand liability positions are presented net by counterparty on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet when a valid master netting agreement\nexists and the other conditions set out in ASC Topic 210-20,\nBalance Sheet\u2014Offsetting , are met. See Note 23. The Company\nuses a number of techniques to determine the fair value of\ntrading assets and liabilities, which are described in Note 25.\nSecurities Borrowed and Securities Loaned Securities borrowing\nand lending transactions do not constitute a sale of the\nunderlying securities for accounting purposes and are treated as\ncollateralized financing transactions. Such transactions are\nrecorded at the amount of proceeds advanced or received plus\naccrued interest. As described in Note 26, the Company has\nelected to apply fair value accounting to a number of securities\nborrowing and lending transactions. Fees received or paid for\nall securities borrowing and lending transactions are recorded\nin Interest revenue or Interest expense at the contractually\nspecified rate. Where the conditions of ASC 210-20-45-1, Balance\nSheet\u2014Offsetting: Right of Setoff Conditions , are met,\nsecurities borrowing and lending transactions are presented net\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company monitors the fair\nvalue of securities borrowed or loaned on a daily basis and\nobtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. As described in Note 25, the\nCompany uses a discounted cash flow technique to determine the\nfair value of securities lending and borrowing transactions.\nRepurchase and Resale Agreements Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase (repos) and securities purchased under\nagreements to resell (reverse repos) do not constitute a sale\n(or purchase) of the underlying securities for accounting\npurposes and are treated as collateralized financing\ntransactions. As described in Note 26, the Company has elected\nto apply fair value accounting to certain portions of such\ntransactions, with changes in fair value reported in earnings.\nAny transactions for which fair value accounting has not been\nelected are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received\nplus accrued interest. Irrespective of whether the Company has\nelected fair value accounting, interest paid or received on all\nrepo and reverse\n                              146                               \nrepo transactions is recorded in Interest expense or Interest\nrevenue at the contractually specified rate. Where the\nconditions of ASC 210-20-45-11, Balance Sheet\u2014Offsetting:\nRepurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements , are met, repos\nand reverse repos are presented net on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The Company\u2019s policy is to take possession of securities\npurchased under reverse repurchase agreements. The Company\nmonitors the fair value of securities subject to repurchase or\nresale on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection.\nAs described in Note 25, the Company uses a discounted cash flow\ntechnique to determine the fair value of repo and reverse repo\ntransactions. Loans Loans are reported at their outstanding\nprincipal balances net of any unearned income and unamortized\ndeferred fees and costs, except for credit card receivable\nbalances, which include accrued interest and fees. Loan\norigination fees and certain direct origination costs are\ngenerally deferred and recognized as adjustments to income over\nthe lives of the related loans. As described in Note 26, Citi\nhas elected fair value accounting for certain loans. Such loans\nare carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in\nearnings. Interest income on such loans is recorded in Interest\nrevenue at the contractually specified rate. Loans that are\nheld-for-investment are classified as Loans, net of unearned\nincome on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related cash\nflows are included within the cash flows from the investing\nactivities category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\non the line Change in loans . However, when the initial intent\nfor holding a loan has changed from held-for-investment to held-\nfor-sale (HFS), the loan is reclassified to HFS, but the related\ncash flows continue to be reported in cash flows from investing\nactivities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on the\nline Proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans . Consumer\nLoans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed\nprimarily by the Personal Banking and Wealth Management and\nLegacy Franchises businesses (except Mexico SBMM loans).\nConsumer Non-accrual and Re-aging Policies As a general rule,\ninterest accrual ceases for installment and real estate (both\nopen- and closed-end) loans when payments are 90days\ncontractually past due. For credit cards and other unsecured\nrevolving loans, however, Citi generally accrues interest until\npayments are 180days past due. As a result of OCC guidance, home\nequity loans in regulated bank entities are classified as non-\naccrual if the related residential first mortgage is 90days or\nmore past due. Also as a result of OCC guidance, mortgage loans\nin regulated bank entities are classified as non-accrual within\n60days of notification that the borrower has filed for\nbankruptcy, with the exception of Federal Housing Administration\n(FHA)-insured loans. Loans that have been modified to grant a\nconcession to a borrower in financial difficulty may not be\naccruing interest at the time of the modification. The policy\nfor returning such modified loans to accrual status varies by\nproduct and/or region. In most cases, a minimum number of\npayments (ranging from oneto six) is required, while in other\ncases the loan is never returned to accrual status. For\nregulated bank entities, such modified loans are returned to\naccrual status if a credit evaluation at the time of, or\nsubsequent to, the modification indicates the borrower is able\nto meet the restructured terms, and the borrower is current and\nhas demonstrated a reasonable period of sustained payment\nperformance (minimum six monthsof consecutive payments). For\nU.S. consumer loans, generally one of the conditions to qualify\nfor modification (other than for loan modifications made through\nthe CARES Act relief provisions or banking agency guidance for\npandemic-related issues) is that a minimum number of payments\n(typically ranging from oneto three) must be made. Upon\nmodification, the loan is re-aged to current status. However,\nre-aging practices for certain open-ended consumer loans, such\nas credit cards, are governed by Federal Financial Institutions\nExamination Council (FFIEC) guidelines. For open-ended consumer\nloans subject to FFIEC guidelines, one of the conditions for the\nloan to be re-aged to current status is that at least\nthreeconsecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent\namount, must be received. In addition, under FFIEC guidelines,\nthe number of times that such a loan can be re-aged is subject\nto limitations (generally once in 12 months and twice in five\nyears). Furthermore, FHA and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\nloans may only be modified under those respective agencies\u2019\nguidelines, and payments are not always required in order to re-\nage a modified loan to current. Consumer Charge-Off Policies\nCiti\u2019s charge-off policies follow the general guidelines below:\n\u2022 Unsecured installment loans are charged off at 120days\ncontractually past due. \u2022 Unsecured revolving loans and credit\ncard loans are charged off at 180days contractually past due. \u2022\nLoans secured with non-real estate collateral are written down\nto the estimated value of the collateral, less costs to sell, at\n120days contractually past due. \u2022 Real estate-secured loans are\nwritten down to the estimated value of the property, less costs\nto sell, at 180days contractually past due. \u2022 Real estate-\nsecured loans are charged off no later than 180days\ncontractually past due if a decision has been made not to\nforeclose on the loans. \u2022 Unsecured loans in bankruptcy are\ncharged off within 60days of notification of filing by the\nbankruptcy court or in accordance with Citi\u2019s charge-off policy,\nwhichever occurs earlier. \u2022 Real estate-secured loans in\nbankruptcy, other than FHA-insured loans, are written down to\nthe estimated value of the property, less costs to sell, within\n60days of notification that the borrower has filed for\nbankruptcy or in accordance with Citi\u2019s charge-off policy,\nwhichever is earlier.\n                              147                               \nCorporate Loans Corporate loans represent loans and leases\nmanaged by Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and the Mexico SBMM\ncomponent of Legacy Franchises . Corporate loans are identified\nas impaired and placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is\ndetermined, based on actual experience and a forward-looking\nassessment of the collectability of the loan in full, that the\npayment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or\nprincipal is 90days past due, except when the loan is well\ncollateralized and in the process of collection. Any interest\naccrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is reversed at\n90days past due and charged against current earnings, and\ninterest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent\nactually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectability of principal, all cash receipts are\nthereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the\nloan. Impaired corporate loans and leases are written down to\nthe extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectible.\nImpaired collateral-dependent loans and leases, where repayment\nis expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying\ncollateral and there are no other available and reliable sources\nof repayment, are carried at the lower of amortized cost or\ncollateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to accrual\nstatus when all contractual principal and interest amounts are\nreasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period\nof repayment performance in accordance with the contractual\nterms. Loans Held-for-Sale Corporate and consumer loans that\nhave been identified for sale are classified as loans HFS and\nincluded in Other assets . The practice of Citi\u2019s U.S. prime\nmortgage business has been to sell substantially all of its\nconforming loans. As such, U.S. prime mortgage conforming loans\nare classified as HFS and the fair value option is elected at\norigination, with changes in fair value recorded in Other\nrevenue . With the exception of those loans for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected, HFS loans are accounted for at\nthe lower of cost or market value, with any write-downs or\nsubsequent recoveries charged to Other revenue . The related\ncash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash\nFlows in the cash flows from operating activities category on\nthe line Change in loans HFS . Gains and losses on loans HFS are\ngenerally presented in Other revenue . Gains on sales of fully\nor partially charged-off loans are presented as gross credit\nrecoveries in the Provision for credit losses up to the amount\nof prior charge-offs. Allowances for Credit Losses (ACL)\nCommencing January 1, 2020, Citi adopted ASC 326, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses , using the methodologies described\nbelow. The current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology is\nbased on relevant information about past events, including\nhistorical experience, current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) forecasts that affect the collectability of\nthe reported financial asset balances. If the asset\u2019s life\nextends beyond the R&S forecast period, then historical\nexperience is considered over the remaining life of the assets\nin the ACL. The resulting ACL is adjusted in each subsequent\nreporting period through Provisions for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income to reflect changes in history,\ncurrent conditions and forecasts as well as changes in asset\npositions and portfolios. ASC 326 defines the ACL as a valuation\naccount that is deducted from the amortized cost of a financial\nasset to present the net amount that management expects to\ncollect on the financial asset over its expected life. All\nfinancial assets carried at amortized cost are in the scope of\nASC 326, while assets measured at fair value are excluded. See\nNote 13 for a discussion of impairment on available-for-sale\n(AFS) securities. Increases and decreases to the allowances are\nrecorded in Provisions for credit losses . The CECL methodology\nutilizes a lifetime expected credit loss (ECL) measurement\nobjective for the recognition of credit losses for held-for-\ninvestment (HFI) loans, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities,\nreceivables and other financial assets measured at amortized\ncost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired.\nWithin the life of a loan or other financial asset, the\nmethodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the\nprovision for credit losses and the related ACL than under the\nprior probable incurred loss model. Estimation of ECLs requires\nCiti to make assumptions regarding the likelihood and severity\nof credit loss events and their impact on expected cash flows,\nwhich drive the probability of default (PD), loss given default\n(LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) models and, where Citi\ndiscounts the ECL, using discounting techniques for certain\nproducts. Citi considers a multitude of global macroeconomic\nvariables for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the ACL.\nCiti\u2019s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP\ngrowth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most\nsignificantly affect its estimate of the ACL. Under the base\nmacroeconomic forecast as of 4Q22, U.S. real GDP growth is\nexpected to decline during 2023, and the unemployment rate is\nexpected to increase modestly over the forecast horizon, broadly\nreturning to pre-pandemic levels. The macroeconomic scenario\nweights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among\nother factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic\ndrivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other\nmacroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario\nweights on a quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the\nbase scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario reflects a more severe recession,\nincluding an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.9%\nover the eight-quarter R&S period, with a peak difference of\n2.9% in the second quarter of 2024. The downside scenario also\nreflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2023 of\n2.4%, with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference of 3.3% in the\nsecond quarter of 2023.\n                              148                               \nThe following are the main factors and interpretations that Citi\nconsiders when estimating the ACL under the CECL methodology: \u2022\nCECL reserves are estimated over the contractual term of the\nfinancial asset, which is adjusted for expected prepayments.\nExpected extensions are generally not considered unless the\noption to extend the loan cannot be canceled unilaterally by\nCiti. Modifications are also not considered, unless Citi has a\nreasonable expectation that it will execute a troubled debt\nrestructuring (TDR). \u2022 Credit enhancements that are not\nfreestanding (such as those that are included in the original\nterms of the contract or those executed in conjunction with the\nlending transaction) are considered loss mitigants for purposes\nof CECL reserve estimation. \u2022 For unconditionally cancelable\naccounts (generally credit cards), reserves are based on the\nexpected life of the balance as of the evaluation date (assuming\nno further charges) and do not include any undrawn commitments\nthat are unconditionally cancelable. Reserves are included for\nundrawn commitments for accounts that are not unconditionally\ncancelable (such as letters of credit and corporate loan\ncommitments, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), undrawn\nmortgage loan commitments and financial guarantees). \u2022 CECL\nmodels are designed to be economically sensitive. They utilize\nthe macroeconomic forecasts provided by Citi\u2019s enterprise\nscenario group that are approved by senior management. Analysis\nis performed and documented to determine the necessary\nqualitative management adjustment (QMA) to capture idiosyncratic\nevents and model uncertainty. \u2022 The portion of the forecast that\nreflects the enterprise scenario group\u2019s R&S period indicates\nthe maximum length of time its models can produce a R&S\nmacroeconomic forecast, after which mean reversion reflecting\nhistorical loss experience is used for the remaining life of the\nloan to estimate expected credit losses. For the loss forecast,\nbusinesses consume the macroeconomic forecast as determined to\nbe appropriate and justifiable. Citi\u2019s ability to forecast\ncredit losses over the R&S period is based on the ability to\nforecast economic activity over a reasonable and supportable\ntime window. The R&S period reflects the overall ability to have\na reasonable and supportable forecast of credit loss based on\neconomic forecasts. \u2022 The loss models consume all or a portion\nof the R&S economic forecast and then revert to historical loss\nexperience. The R&S forecast period for consumer and corporate\nloans is eight quarters. \u2022 The ACL incorporates provisions for\naccrued interest on products that are not subject to a non-\naccrual and timely write-off policy (e.g., credit cards, etc.).\n\u2022 The reserves for TDRs are calculated using a method that\nconsiders discounted cash flows and appropriate macroeconomic\nforecast data for the exposure type. For TDR loans that are\ncollateral dependent, the ACL is based on the fair value of the\ncollateral. \u2022 Citi uses the most recent available information to\ninform its macroeconomic forecasts, allowing sufficient time for\nanalysis of the results and corresponding approvals. Key\nvariables are reviewed for significant changes through year end\nand changes to portfolio positions are reflected in the ACL. \u2022\nReserves are calculated at an appropriately granular level and\non a pooled basis where financial assets share risk\ncharacteristics. At a minimum, reserves are calculated at a\nportfolio level (product and country). Where a financial asset\ndoes not share risk characteristics with any of the pools, it is\nevaluated for credit losses individually. Quantitative and\nQualitative Components of the ACL The loss likelihood and\nseverity models use both internal and external information and\nare sensitive to forecasts of different macroeconomic\nconditions. For the quantitative component, Citi uses multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios and associated probabilities to estimate\nthe ECL. Estimates of these ECLs are based upon (i) Citigroup\u2019s\ninternal system of credit risk ratings, (ii) historical default\nand loss data, including comprehensive internal history and\nrating agency information regarding default rates and internal\ndata on the severity of losses in the event of default, and\n(iii) a R&S forecast of future macroeconomic conditions. ECL is\ndetermined primarily by utilizing models for the borrowers\u2019 PD,\nLGD and EAD. Adjustments may be made to this data, including (i)\nstatistically calculated estimates to cover the historical\nfluctuation of the default rates over the credit cycle, the\nhistorical variability of loss severity among defaulted loans\nand the degree to which there are large obligor concentrations\nin the global portfolio, and (ii) adjustments made for\nspecifically known items, such as current environmental factors\nand credit trends. Any adjustments needed to the modeled\nexpected losses in the quantitative calculations are addressed\nthrough a qualitative adjustment. The qualitative adjustment\nconsiders, among other things: certain portfolio characteristics\nand concentrations; collateral coverage; model limitations;\nidiosyncratic events; and other relevant criteria under banking\nsupervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative adjustment\nalso reflects the estimated impact of the pandemic on the\neconomic forecasts and the impact on credit loss estimates. The\ntotal ACL is composed of the quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Citi's qualitative component declined year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by the incorporation of multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios in the quantitative component and\nreleases of COVID-19\u2013related uncertainty reserves as the\nportfolio continues to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels and\nas these risks are captured in the quantitative component of the\nACL. See \u201cAccounting Changes\u201d below for information about how\nthe calculation of the quantitative component of the ACL changed\nin 2022.\n                              149                               \nConsumer Loans For consumer loans, most portfolios including\nNorth America cards, mortgages and personal installment loans\n(PILs) are covered by the PD, LGD and EAD loss forecasting\nmodels. Some smaller international portfolios are covered by\neconometric models where the gross credit loss (GCL) rate is\nforecasted. The modeling of all retail products is performed by\nexamining risk drivers for a given portfolio; these drivers\nrelate to exposures with similar credit risk characteristics and\nconsider past events, current conditions and R&S forecasts.\nUnder the PD x LGD x EAD approach, GCLs and recoveries are\ncaptured on an undiscounted basis. Citi incorporates expected\nrecoveries on loans into its reserve estimate, including\nexpected recoveries on assets previously written off. CECL\ndefines the exposure\u2019s expected life as the remaining\ncontractual maturity including any expected prepayments.\nSubsequent changes to the contractual terms that are the result\nof a re-underwriting are not included in the loan\u2019s expected\nCECL life. Citi does not establish reserves for the\nuncollectible accrued interest on non-revolving consumer\nproducts, such as mortgages and installment loans, which are\nsubject to a non-accrual and timely write-off policy at 90 days\npast due. As such, only the principal balance is subject to the\nCECL reserve methodology and interest does not attract a further\nreserve. Deferred origination costs and fees related to new\ncredit card account originations are amortized within a 12-month\nperiod, and an ACL is provided for components in the scope of\nthe ASC. Separate valuation allowances are determined for\nimpaired smaller-balance homogeneous loans whose terms have been\nmodified in a TDR. Long-term modification programs, and short-\nterm (less than 12 months) modifications that provide\nconcessions (such as interest rate reductions) to borrowers in\nfinancial difficulty, are reported as TDRs. In addition, loan\nmodifications that involve a trial period are reported as TDRs\nat the start of the trial period. The ACL for TDRs is determined\nusing a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. When a DCF approach\nis used, the initial allowance for ECLs is calculated as the\nexpected contractual cash flows discounted at the loan\u2019s\noriginal effective interest rate. DCF techniques are applied for\nconsumer loans only if they are classified as TDR loan\nexposures. For credit cards, Citi uses the payment rate\napproach, which leverages payment rate curves, to determine the\npayments that should be applied to liquidate the end-of-period\nbalance (CECL balance) in the estimation of EAD. The payment\nrate approach uses customer payment behavior (payment rate) to\nestablish the portion of the CECL balance that will be paid each\nmonth. These payment rates are defined as the percentage of\nprincipal payments received in the respective month divided by\nthe prior month\u2019s billed principal balance. The liquidation\n(CECL payment) amount for each forecast period is determined by\nmultiplying the CECL balance by that period\u2019s forecasted payment\nrate. The cumulative sum of these payments less the CECL balance\nproduces the balance liquidation curve. Citi does not apply a\nnon-accrual policy to credit card receivables; rather, they are\nsubject to full charge-off at 180 days past due or bankruptcy.\nAs such, the entire customer balance up until write-off,\nincluding accrued interest and fees, is subject to the CECL\nreserve methodology. Corporate Loans, HTM Securities and Other\nassets Citi records allowances for credit losses on all\nfinancial assets carried at amortized cost that are in the scope\nof CECL, including corporate loans classified as HFI, HTM debt\nsecurities and Other assets . Discounting techniques are applied\nfor corporate loans classified as HFI and HTM securities and\nnon-accrual/TDR loan exposures. All cash flows are fully\ndiscounted to the reporting date. The ACL includes Citi\u2019s\nestimate of all credit losses expected to be incurred over the\nestimated full contractual life of the financial asset. The\ncontractual life of the financial asset does not include\nexpected extensions, renewals or modifications, except for\ninstances where the Company reasonably expects to extend the\ntenor of the financial asset pursuant to a future TDR. Where\nCiti has an unconditional option to extend the contractual term,\nCiti does not consider the potential extension in determining\nthe contractual term; however, where the borrower has the sole\nright to exercise the extension option without Citi\u2019s approval,\nCiti does consider the potential extension in determining the\ncontractual term. The decrease in credit losses under CECL at\nthe date of adoption on January 1, 2020, compared with the prior\nincurred loss methodology, was largely due to more precise\ncontractual maturities that resulted in shorter remaining\ntenors, the incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific\nhistorical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies. The Company\nprimarily bases its ACL on models that assess the likelihood and\nseverity of credit events and their impact on cash flows under\nR&S forecasted economic scenarios. Allowances consider the\nprobability of the borrower\u2019s default, the loss the Company\nwould incur upon default and the borrower\u2019s exposure at default.\nSuch models discount the present value of all future cash flows,\nusing the asset\u2019s effective interest rate (EIR). Citi applies a\nmore simplified approach based on historical loss rates to\ncertain exposures recorded in Other assets and certain loan\nexposures in the private bank within Consumer loans . The\nCompany considers the risk of nonpayment to be zero for U.S.\nTreasuries and U.S. government-sponsored agency guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) and, as such, Citi does not\nhave an ACL for these securities. For all other HTM debt\nsecurities, ECLs are estimated using PD models and discounting\ntechniques, which incorporate assumptions regarding the\nlikelihood and severity of credit losses. For structured\nsecurities, specific models use relevant assumptions for the\nunderlying collateral type. A discounting approach is applied to\nHTM direct obligations of a single issuer, similar to that used\nfor corporate HFI loans. Other Financial Assets with Zero\nExpected Credit Losses For certain financial assets, zero\nexpected credit losses will be recognized where the expectation\nof nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, based on\nthere being no history of loss and the nature of the\nreceivables.\n                              150                               \nSecured Financing Transactions Most of Citi\u2019s reverse repurchase\nagreements, securities borrowing arrangements and margin loans\nrequire that the borrower continually adjust the amount of the\ncollateral securing Citi\u2019s interest, primarily resulting from\nchanges in the fair value of such collateral. In such\narrangements, ACLs are recorded based only on the amount by\nwhich the asset\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of\nthe collateral. No ACLs are recorded where the fair value of the\ncollateral is equal to or exceeds the asset\u2019s amortized cost\nbasis, as Citi does not expect to incur credit losses on such\nwell-collateralized exposures. For certain margin loans\npresented in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, ACLL is\nestimated using the same approach as corporate loans. Accrued\nInterest CECL permits entities to make an accounting policy\nelection not to reserve for interest, if the entity has a policy\nin place that will result in timely reversal or write-off of\ninterest. However, when a non-accrual or timely charge-off\npolicy is not applied, an ACL is recognized on accrued interest\nat 90 days past due. For HTM debt securities, Citi established a\nnon-accrual policy that results in timely write-off of accrued\ninterest. For corporate loans, where a timely charge-off policy\nis used, Citi has elected to recognize an ACL on accrued\ninterest receivable. The LGD models for corporate loans include\nan adjustment for estimated accrued interest. Reasonably\nExpected TDRs For corporate loans, the reasonable expectation of\nthe TDR concept requires that the contractual life over which\nECLs are estimated be extended when a TDR that results in a\ntenor extension is reasonably expected. Reasonably expected TDRs\nare included in the life of the asset. A discounting technique\nor collateral-dependent practical expedient is used for non-\naccrual and TDR loan exposures that do not share risk\ncharacteristics with other loans and are individually assessed.\nLoans modified in accordance with the CARES Act and bank\nregulatory guidance are not classified as TDRs. Purchased\nCredit-Deteriorated (PCD) Assets ASC 326 requires entities that\nhave acquired financial assets (such as loans and HTM\nsecurities) with an intent to hold, to evaluate whether those\nassets have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration\nin credit quality since origination. These assets are subject to\nspecialized accounting at initial recognition under CECL.\nSubsequent measurement of PCD assets will remain consistent with\nother purchased or originated assets, i.e., non-PCD assets. CECL\nintroduces the notion of PCD assets, which replaces purchased\ncredit impaired (PCI) accounting under prior U.S. GAAP. CECL\nrequires the estimation of credit losses to be performed on a\npool basis unless a PCD asset does not share characteristics\nwith any pool. If certain PCD assets do not meet the conditions\nfor aggregation, those PCD assets should be accounted for\nseparately. This determination must be made at the date the PCD\nasset is purchased. In estimating ECLs from day 2 onward, pools\ncan potentially be reassembled based upon similar risk\ncharacteristics. When PCD assets are pooled, Citi determines the\namount of the initial ACL at the pool level. The amount of the\ninitial ACL for a PCD asset represents the portion of the total\ndiscount at acquisition that relates to credit and is recognized\nas a \u201cgross-up\u201d of the purchase price to arrive at the PCD\nasset\u2019s (or pool\u2019s) amortized cost. Any difference between the\nunpaid principal balance and the amortized cost is considered to\nbe related to non-credit factors and results in a discount or\npremium, which is amortized to interest income over the life of\nthe individual asset (or pool). Direct expenses incurred related\nto the acquisition of PCD assets and other assets and\nliabilities in a business combination are expensed as incurred.\nSubsequent accounting for acquired PCD assets is the same as the\naccounting for originated assets; changes in the allowance are\nrecorded in Provisions for credit losses . Consumer Citi does\nnot purchase whole portfolios of PCD assets in its retail\nbusinesses. However, there may be a small portion of a purchased\nportfolio that is identified as PCD at the purchase date.\nInterest income recognition does not vary between PCD and non-\nPCD assets. A consumer financial asset is considered to be more-\nthan-insignificantly credit deteriorated if it is more than 30\ndays past due at the purchase date. Corporate Citi generally\nclassifies wholesale loans and debt securities classified as HTM\nor AFS as PCD when both of the following criteria are met: (i)\nthe purchase price discount is at least 10% of par and (ii) the\npurchase date is more than 90 days after the origination or\nissuance date. Citi classifies HTM beneficial interests rated\nAA- and lower obtained at origination from certain\nsecuritization transactions as PCD when there is a significant\ndifference (i.e., 10% or greater) between contractual cash\nflows, adjusted for prepayments, and expected cash flows at the\ndate of recognition. Reserve Estimates and Policies Management\nprovides reserves for an estimate of lifetime ECLs in the funded\nloan portfolio on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the form of\nan ACL. These reserves are established in accordance with\nCitigroup\u2019s credit reserve policies, as approved by the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup Board of Directors. Citi\u2019s Chief Risk\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer review the adequacy of the\ncredit loss reserves each quarter with risk management and\nfinance representatives for each applicable business area.\nApplicable business areas include those having classifiably\nmanaged portfolios, where internal credit risk ratings are\nassigned (primarily ICG ) and delinquency-managed portfolios\n(primarily PBWM ) or modified consumer loans, where concessions\nwere granted due to the borrowers\u2019 financial difficulties. The\naforementioned representatives for these business areas present\nrecommended reserve balances for their funded and unfunded\nlending portfolios along with supporting quantitative and\nqualitative data discussed below. Estimated Credit Losses for\nPortfolios of Performing Exposures Risk management and finance\nrepresentatives who cover business areas with delinquency-\nmanaged portfolios\n                              151                               \ncontaining smaller-balance homogeneous loans present their\nrecommended reserve balances based on leading credit indicators,\nincluding loan delinquencies and changes in portfolio size as\nwell as economic trends, including current and future housing\nprices, unemployment, length of time in foreclosure, costs to\nsell and GDP. This methodology is applied separately for each\nproduct within each geographic region in which these portfolios\nexist. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates\nand judgments. Risk management and finance representatives who\ncover business areas with classifiably managed portfolios\npresent their recommended reserve balances based on the\nfrequency of default, risk ratings, loss recovery rates, size\nand diversity of individual large credits, and ability of\nborrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the\nforeign currency necessary for orderly debt servicing. Changes\nin these estimates could have a direct impact on the credit\ncosts in any period and could result in a change in the\nallowance. Allowance for Unfunded Lending Commitments Credit\nloss reserves are recognized on all off-balance sheet\ncommitments that are not unconditionally cancelable. Corporate\nloan EAD models include an incremental usage factor (or credit\nconversion factor) to estimate ECLs on amounts undrawn at the\nreporting date. Off-balance sheet commitments include unfunded\nexposures, revolving facilities, securities underwriting\ncommitments, letters of credit, HELOCs and financial guarantees\n(excluding performance guarantees). This reserve is classified\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Other liabilities . Changes\nto the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are recorded\nin Provision for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments .\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) Mortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs) are recognized as intangible assets when purchased or\nwhen the Company sells or securitizes loans acquired through\npurchase or origination and retains the right to service the\nloans. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair\nvalue, with changes in value recorded in Other revenue in the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income. For additional\ninformation on the Company\u2019s MSRs, see Notes 16 and 21. Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair\nvalue of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment\ntesting and interim assessments between annual tests if an event\noccurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying\namount. Under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other and\nupon the adoption of ASU No. 2017-04 on January 1, 2020, the\nCompany has an option to assess qualitative factors to determine\nif it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. If,\nafter assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the\nCompany determines that it is not more-likely-than-not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nno further testing is necessary. If, however, the Company\ndetermines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the\nCompany must perform the quantitative test. The Company has an\nunconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for\nany reporting unit in any reporting period and proceed directly\nto the quantitative test. The quantitative test requires a\ncomparison of the fair value of the individual reporting unit to\nits carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the\nreporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the related\ngoodwill is considered not impaired and no further analysis is\nnecessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds\nthe fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount\nequal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill\nallocated to that reporting unit. Upon any business disposition,\ngoodwill is allocated to, and derecognized with, the disposed\nbusiness based on the ratio of the fair value of the disposed\nbusiness to the fair value of the reporting unit. Additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s goodwill impairment testing can be found\nin Note 16. Intangible Assets Intangible assets\u2014 including core\ndeposit intangibles, present value of future profits, purchased\ncredit card relationships, credit card contract-related\nintangibles, other customer relationships and other intangible\nassets, but excluding MSRs\u2014are amortized over their estimated\nuseful lives. Credit card contract-related intangibles include\nfixed and unconditional costs incurred to renew or extend the\ncontract with a card partner. In estimating the useful life of a\ncredit card contract-related intangible, the Company considers\nthe probability of contract renewal or extension to determine\nthe period that the asset is expected to contribute future cash\nflows. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite\nuseful lives, primarily trade names, are not amortized and are\nsubject to annual impairment tests. An impairment exists if the\ncarrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds\nits fair value. For other intangible assets subject to\namortization, an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount\nis not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible\nasset. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment includes\nlease right-of-use assets, property and equipment (including\npurchased and developed software), net of depreciation and\namortization. Substantially all lease right-of-use assets are\namortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and\nsubstantially all property and equipment is depreciated or\namortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the\nasset. Other Assets and Other Liabilities Other assets include,\namong other items, loans HFS, deferred tax assets, equity method\ninvestments, interest and fees receivable, repossessed assets,\nother receivables, and assets from businesses classified as HFS\nthat are reclassified from other balance sheet line items. Other\nliabilities include, among other items, accrued expenses, lease\nliabilities, deferred tax liabilities, reserves for legal claims\nand legal fee accruals,\n                              152                               \ntaxes, unfunded lending commitments, repositioning reserves,\nother payables, and liabilities from businesses classified as\nHFS that are reclassified from other balance sheet line items.\nLegal fee accruals are recognized as incurred. Other Real Estate\nOwned and Repossessed Assets Real estate or other assets\nreceived through foreclosure or repossession are generally\nreported in Other assets , net of a valuation allowance for\nselling costs and subsequent declines in fair value.\nSecuritizations There are two key accounting determinations that\nmust be made relating to securitizations. Citi first makes a\ndetermination as to whether the securitization entity must be\nconsolidated. Second, it determines whether the transfer of\nfinancial assets to the entity is considered a sale under GAAP.\nIf the securitization entity is a VIE, the Company consolidates\nthe VIE if it is the primary beneficiary (as discussed in\n\u201cVariable Interest Entities\u201d above). For all other\nsecuritization entities determined not to be VIEs in which\nCitigroup participates, consolidation is based on which party\nhas voting control of the entity, giving consideration to\nremoval and liquidation rights in certain partnership\nstructures. Only securitization entities controlled by Citigroup\nare consolidated. Interests in the securitized and sold assets\nmay be retained in the form of subordinated or senior interest-\nonly strips, subordinated tranches, spread accounts and\nservicing rights. In credit card securitizations, the Company\nretains a seller\u2019s interest in the credit card receivables\ntransferred to the trusts, which is not in securitized form. In\nthe case of consolidated securitization entities, including the\ncredit card trusts, these retained interests are not reported on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The securitized loans remain\non the balance sheet. Substantially all of the consumer loans\nsold or securitized through non-consolidated trusts by Citigroup\nare U.S. prime residential mortgage loans. Retained interests in\nnon-consolidated mortgage securitization trusts are classified\nas Trading account assets , except for MSRs, which are included\nin Intangible assets on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDebt Short-term borrowings and Long-term debt are accounted for\nat amortized cost, except where the Company has elected to\nreport the debt instruments (including certain structured notes)\nat fair value, or debt that is in a fair value hedging\nrelationship. Premiums, discounts and issuance costs on long-\nterm debt accounted for at amortized cost are amortized over the\ncontractual term using the effective interest method. Transfers\nof Financial Assets For a transfer of financial assets to be\nconsidered a sale, (i) the assets must be legally isolated from\nthe Company, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (ii) the\npurchaser must have the right to pledge or sell the assets\ntransferred (or, if the purchaser is an entity whose sole\npurpose is to engage in securitization and asset-backed\nfinancing activities through the issuance of beneficial\ninterests and that entity is constrained from pledging the\nassets it receives, each beneficial interest holder must have\nthe right to sell or pledge their beneficial interests) and\n(iii) the Company may not have an option or obligation to\nreacquire the assets. If these sale requirements are met, the\nassets are removed from the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. If the conditions for sale are not met, the transfer is\nconsidered to be a secured borrowing, the assets remain on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet and the sale proceeds are recognized\nas the Company\u2019s liability. A legal opinion on a sale generally\nis obtained for complex transactions or where the Company has\ncontinuing involvement with assets transferred or with the\nsecuritization entity. For a transfer to be eligible for sale\naccounting, that opinion must state that the asset transfer\nwould be considered a sale and that the assets transferred would\nnot be consolidated with the Company\u2019s other assets in the event\nof the Company\u2019s insolvency. For a transfer of a portion of a\nfinancial asset to be considered a sale, the portion transferred\nmust meet the definition of a participating interest. A\nparticipating interest must represent a pro rata ownership in an\nentire financial asset; all cash flows must be divided\nproportionately, with the same priority of payment; no\nparticipating interest in the transferred asset may be\nsubordinated to the interest of another participating interest\nholder; and no party may have the right to pledge or exchange\nthe entire financial asset unless all participating interest\nholders agree. Otherwise, the transfer is accounted for as a\nsecured borrowing. See Note 22 for further discussion. Risk\nManagement Activities\u2014Derivatives Used for Hedging Purposes The\nCompany manages its exposures to market movements outside of its\ntrading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix,\neither directly or through the use of derivative financial\nproducts, including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards,\npurchased options and commodities, as well as foreign-exchange\ncontracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value\nin Trading account assets and Trading account liabilities . See\nNote 23 for a further discussion of the Company\u2019s hedging and\nderivative activities. Instrument-Specific Credit Risk Citi\npresents separately in AOCI the portion of the total change in\nthe fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the\ninstrument-specific credit risk, when the entity has elected to\nmeasure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair\nvalue option for financial instruments. Accordingly, the change\nin fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option was\nelected, related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit spreads,\nis presented in AOCI . Employee Benefits Expense Employee\nbenefits expense includes current service costs of pension and\nother postretirement benefit plans (which are accrued on a\ncurrent basis), contributions and unrestricted awards under\nother employee plans, the amortization of restricted stock\nawards and costs of other employee benefits. For its most\nsignificant pension and postretirement benefit plans\n(Significant Plans), Citigroup measures and discloses\n                              153                               \nplan obligations, plan assets and periodic plan expense\nquarterly, instead of annually. The effect of remeasuring the\nSignificant Plan obligations and assets by updating plan\nactuarial assumptions on a quarterly basis is reflected in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and periodic plan\nexpense. All other plans (All Other Plans) are remeasured\nannually. Benefits earned during the year are reported in\nCompensation and benefits expenses and all other components of\nthe net annual benefit cost are reported in Other operating\nexpenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.See Note 8.\nStock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes compensation\nexpense related to stock awards over the requisite service\nperiod, generally based on the instruments\u2019 grant-date fair\nvalue, reduced by actual forfeitures as they occur. Compensation\ncost related to awards granted to employees who meet certain age\nplus years-of-service requirements (retirement-eligible\nemployees) is accrued in the year prior to the grant date, in\nthe same manner as the accrual for cash incentive compensation.\nCertain stock awards with performance conditions or certain\nclawback provisions are subject to variable accounting, pursuant\nto which the associated compensation expense fluctuates with\nchanges in Citigroup\u2019s common stock price.See Note 7. Income\nTaxes The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the U.S.\nand its states and municipalities, as well as the non-U.S.\njurisdictions in which it operates. These tax laws are complex\nand may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer\nand the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In\nestablishing a provision for income tax expense, the Company\nmust make judgments and interpretations about these tax laws.\nThe Company must also make estimates about when in the future\ncertain items will affect taxable income in the various tax\njurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. Disputes over\ninterpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and\nadjudication by the court systems of the various tax\njurisdictions or, may be settled with the taxing authority upon\nexamination or audit. The Company treats interest and penalties\non income taxes as a component of Income tax expense . Deferred\ntaxes are recorded for the future consequences of events that\nhave been recognized in financial statements or tax returns,\nbased upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are\nrecognized subject to management\u2019s judgment about whether\nrealization is more-likely-than-not. ASC 740, Income Taxes ,\nsets out a consistent framework to determine the appropriate\nlevel of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions.\nThis interpretation uses a two-step approach wherein a tax\nbenefit is recognized if a position is more-likely-than-not to\nbe sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be\nthe highest tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be\nrealized. ASC 740 also sets out disclosure requirements to\nenhance transparency of an entity\u2019s tax reserves. See Note 9 for\na further description of the Company\u2019s tax provision and related\nincome tax assets and liabilities. Commissions, Underwriting and\nPrincipal Transactions Commissions and fees revenues are\nrecognized in income when earned. Underwriting revenues are\nrecognized in income typically at the closing of the\ntransaction. Principal transactions revenues are recognized in\nincome on a trade-date basis.See Note 5 for a description of the\nCompany\u2019s revenue recognition policies for Commissions and fees\n, and Note 6 for details of Principal transactions revenue.\nEarnings per Share Earnings per share (EPS) is calculated using\nthe two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings\n(distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock\nand participating securities. Undistributed earnings are\ncalculated after deducting preferred stock dividends, any\nissuance cost incurred at the time of issuance of redeemed\npreferred stock and dividends paid and accrued to common stocks\nand RSU/DSA share awards. Citi grants restricted and deferred\nshare awards under its shares-based compensation programs, which\nentitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during\nthe vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to\nholders of the Company\u2019s common stock. These unvested awards\nmeet the definition of participating securities based on their\nrespective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they\nare treated as a separate class of securities and are not\nincluded in computing basic EPS. Diluted EPS incorporates the\npotential impact of contingently issuable shares, stock options\nand awards which require future service as a condition of\ndelivery of the underlying common stock. Anti-dilutive options\nand warrants are disregarded in the EPS calculations. Diluted\nEPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock\nmethods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Participating\nsecurities are not included as incremental shares in computing\ndiluted EPS. Use of Estimates Management must make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements\nand the related Notes. Such estimates are used in connection\nwith certain fair value measurements. See Note 25 for further\ndiscussions on estimates used in the determination of fair\nvalue. Moreover, estimates are significant in determining the\namounts of other-than-temporary impairments, impairments of\ngoodwill and other intangible assets, provisions for probable\nlosses that may arise from credit-related exposures, probable\nand estimable losses related to litigation and regulatory\nproceedings, and income taxes. While management makes its best\njudgment, actual amounts or results could differ from those\nestimates. Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Flows Cash\nequivalents are defined as those amounts included in Cash and\ndue from banks and Deposits with banks . Certain cash balances\nare restricted by regulatory or contractual requirements.See\nNote 27 for additional information on restricted cash.\n                              154                               \nRelated Party Transactions The Company has related party\ntransactions with certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates.\nThese transactions, which are primarily short-term in nature,\ninclude cash accounts, collateralized financing transactions,\nmargin accounts, derivative transactions, charges for\noperational support and the borrowing and lending of funds, and\nare entered into in the ordinary course of business. ACCOUNTING\nCHANGES Reference Rate Reform On December 21, 2022, the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No.\n2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the\nSunset Date of Topic 848 , which extends the period of time\npreparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance.\nIn 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform\n(Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting , which provides optional guidance\nto ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing\nthe effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. In\n2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) delayed the\nintended cessation date of certain tenors of USD LIBOR to June\n30, 2023. To ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of\ntime during which a significant number of modifications may take\nplace, the ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December\n31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The extension allows Citi to\ntransition its remaining contracts and maintain hedge\naccounting. The ASU was adopted by Citi upon issuance and did\nnot impact financial results in 2022. Voluntary Change in\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment Date During 2022, the Company\nvoluntarily changed its annual goodwill impairment assessment\ndate from July 1 to October 1. See Note 16 for additional\ninformation. Multiple Macroeconomic Scenarios-Based ACL Approach\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, Citi refined its ACL\nmethodology to utilize multiple macroeconomic scenarios to\nestimate its allowance for credit losses. The ACL was previously\nestimated using a combination of a single base-case forecast\nscenario as part of its quantitative component and a component\nof its qualitative management adjustment that reflects economic\nuncertainty from downside macroeconomic scenarios. As a result\nof this change, Citi now explicitly incorporates multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base, upside, and downside\u2014and\nassociated probabilities in the quantitative component when\nestimating its ACL, while still retaining certain of its\nqualitative management adjustments. This refinement represents a\n\u201cchange in accounting estimate\u201d under ASC Topic 250, Accounting\nChanges and Error Corrections , with prospective application\nbeginning in the period of change. This change in accounting\nestimate resulted in a decrease of approximately $ 0.3billion in\nthe allowance for credit losses in the second quarter of 2022,\npartially offsetting an increase of $ 0.8billion in the\nallowance for credit losses due to the increased macroeconomic\nuncertainty and other factors in the second quarter of 2022.\nAccounting for Deposit Insurance Expenses During the fourth\nquarter of 2021, Citi changed its presentation of the deposit\ninsurance costs paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) and similar foreign regulators. These costs\nwere previously presented within Interest expense and, as a\nresult of this change, are now presented within Other operating\nexpenses . Citi concluded that this presentation was preferable\nin Citi\u2019s circumstances, as it better reflected the nature of\nthese deposit insurance costs in that these costs do not\ndirectly represent interest payments to creditors, but are\nsimilar in nature to other payments to regulatory agencies that\nare accounted for as operating expenses. This change in income\nstatement presentation represents a \u201cchange in accounting\nprinciple\u201d under ASC Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error\nCorrections , with retrospective application to the earliest\nperiod presented. This change in accounting principle resulted\nin a reclassification of $ 1,207million, $ 1,203million and $\n781million of deposit insurance expenses from Interest expense\nto Other operating expenses , for the years ended December 31,\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This change had no impact on\nCiti\u2019s net income or the total deposit insurance expense\nincurred by Citi. Accounting for Financial Instruments \u2014 Credit\nLosses Overview In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments \u2014 Credit Losses (Topic 326). The ASU\nintroduced a new credit loss methodology, the CECL methodology,\nwhich requires earlier recognition of credit losses while also\nproviding additional disclosure about credit risk. Citi adopted\nthe ASU as of January 1, 2020, which, as discussed below,\nresulted in an increase in Citi\u2019s Allowance for credit losses\nand a decrease to opening Retained earnings , net of deferred\nincome taxes, at January 1, 2020. The CECL methodology utilizes\na lifetime \u201cexpected credit loss\u201d measurement objective for the\nrecognition of credit losses for loans, HTM debt securities,\nreceivables and other financial assets measured at amortized\ncost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired.\nThe ACL is adjusted each period for changes in lifetime expected\ncredit losses. The CECL methodology represents a significant\nchange from prior U.S. GAAP and replaced the prior multiple\nexisting impairment methods, which generally required that a\nloss be incurred before it was recognized. Within the life cycle\nof a loan or other financial asset, the methodology generally\nresults in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit\nlosses and the related ACL than prior U.S. GAAP. For available-\nfor-sale debt securities where fair value is less than cost that\nCiti intends to hold or more-likely-than-not will not be\nrequired to sell, credit-related impairment, if any, is\nrecognized through an ACL and adjusted each period for changes\nin credit risk. January 1, 2020 CECL Transition (Day 1) Impact\nThe CECL methodology\u2019s impact on expected credit losses, among\nother things, reflects Citi\u2019s view of the current state of the\neconomy, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and quality of\nCiti\u2019s portfolios. At the January 1, 2020 date of\n                              155                               \nadoption, based on forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and\nexposures at that time, the aggregate impact to Citi was an\napproximate $ 4.1billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase\nin the Allowance for credit losses , along with a $ 3.1billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset\nincrease of $ 1.0billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a\n$ 4.9billion build to the Allowance for credit losses for Citi\u2019s\nconsumer exposures, primarily driven by the impact on credit\ncard receivables of longer estimated tenors under the CECL\nlifetime expected credit loss methodology (loss coverage of\napproximately 23months) compared to shorter estimated tenors\nunder the probable loss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP (loss\ncoverage of approximately 14months), net of recoveries, and (ii)\na release of $ 0.8billion of reserves primarily related to\nCiti\u2019s corporate net loan loss exposures, largely due to more\nprecise contractual maturities that result in shorter remaining\ntenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of more specific\nhistorical loss data based on an increase in portfolio\nsegmentation across industries and geographies. Accounting for\nVariable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection Costs During the\nsecond quarter of 2020, Citi changed its accounting for variable\npost-charge-off third-party collection costs, whereby these\ncosts were accounted for as an increase in expenses as incurred\nrather than a reduction in expected credit recoveries. Citi\nconcluded that such a change in the method of accounting is\npreferable in Citi\u2019s circumstances as it better reflects the\nnature of these collection costs. That is, these costs do not\nrepresent reduced payments from borrowers and are similar to\nCiti\u2019s other executory third-party vendor contracts that are\naccounted for as operating expenses as incurred. As a result of\nthis change, Citi had a consumer ACL release of $ 426million in\nthe second quarter of 2020 for its U.S. cards portfolios and $\n122million in the third quarter of 2020 for its international\nportfolios. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the\nsecond quarter of 2020 accounting conclusion from a \u201cchange in\naccounting estimate effected by a change in accounting\nprinciple\u201d to a \u201cchange in accounting principle,\u201d which required\nan adjustment to opening retained earnings rather than net\nincome, with retrospective application to the earliest period\npresented. Citi considered the guidance in ASC Topic 250,\nAccounting Changes and Error Corrections ; ASC Topic 270,\nInterim Reporting ; ASC Topic 250-S99-1, Assessing Materiality ;\nand ASC Topic 250-S99-23, Accounting Changes Not Retroactively\nApplied Due to Immateriality, Considering the Effects of Prior\nYear Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current\nYear Financial Statements . Citi believes that the effects of\nthe revisions were not material to any previously reported\nquarterly or annual period. As a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and\nquarterly results were revised to reflect this change as if it\nwere effective as of January 1, 2020 (impacts to 2018 and 2019\nwere de minimis). Accordingly, Citi recorded an increase to its\nbeginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330million\nand a decrease of $ 443million to its ACL. Further, Citi\nrecorded a decrease of $ 18million to its provisions for credit\nlosses on loans in the first quarter of 2020 and an increase of\n$ 339million and $ 122million to its provisions for credit\nlosses on loans in the second and third quarters of 2020,\nrespectively. In addition, Citi\u2019s operating expenses increased\nby $ 49million and $ 45million, with a corresponding decrease in\nnet credit losses, in the first and second quarters of 2020,\nrespectively. As a result of these changes, Citi\u2019s net income\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020 was $ 330million lower, or\n$ 0.16per share lower, than under the previous presentation as a\nchange in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting\nprinciple.\n                              156                               \nStatement of Cash Flows In the fourth quarter of 2022, Citi\nidentified that certain 2021 and 2020 cash flows related to\npurchases of short-term negotiable certificates of deposit (NCD)\nand maturities of long-term NCDs were misclassified between\npurchases and maturities of AFS securities within investing\nactivities and cash flows from operating activities, based on\nits accounting policy during those periods. As such, Citi\nrevised its 2021 and 2020 cash flows within its 2022\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as follows:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026       20\u2026                          20\u2026                     \n  of        As                 As        As                 As  \n  d\u2026       re\u2026       Re\u2026       r\u2026       re\u2026       R\u2026       re\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  O\u2026    $  -1\u2026    $  -1\u2026    $  -\u2026    $  4,\u2026    $  -\u2026    $  1,\u2026  \n  n\u2026                                                            \n  I\u2026                                                            \n  to                                                            \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  f\u2026                 -1\u2026                          -\u2026            \n  (\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  o\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026       -2\u2026       16\u2026       -\u2026       -3\u2026       9\u2026       -3\u2026  \n  p\u2026                                                            \n  A\u2026       12\u2026         \u2014       1\u2026       10\u2026       1\u2026       11\u2026  \n  m\u2026                                                            \n  I\u2026                                                            \n  to                                                            \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  f\u2026                 16\u2026                          2\u2026            \n  (\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \nAfter the revision, there were ($ 2) billion and ($ 30) million\nof net NCD cash flows presented within operating activities for\n2021 and 2020, respectively. Citi evaluated the effect of the\nrevision, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and concluded\nthat the impact of the revision was not material. Subsequently,\nin the fourth quarter of 2022, Citi voluntarily changed its\npolicy to instead present all short-term NCD cash flows in cash\nflows from investing activities within Other, net . Although\nimmaterial, Citi has adjusted both 2021 and 2020 cash flows\nwithin the 2022 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in\naccordance with this change in presentation. After considering\nthe impact of the revision described above, the impact of the\nchange in presentation resulted in immaterial increases in cash\nflows from operating activities and corresponding decreases in\ncash flows from investing activities of $ 2billion and $\n30million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n                              157                               \nFUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES TDRs\nand Vintage Disclosures In\nMarch 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures . Citi adopted the\nASU on January 1, 2023. The\nASU eliminates the accounting\nand disclosure requirements\nfor TDRs, including the\nrequirement to measure the\nACLL for TDRs using a\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF)\napproach. Citi adopted the\nguidance on the recognition\nand measurement of TDRs under\nthe modified retrospective\napproach. Upon adoption, Citi\ndiscontinued the use of a DCF\napproach for consumer loans\nformerly considered TDRs.\nBeginning January 1, 2023,\nCiti measured the ACLL for all\nconsumer loans under\napproaches that do not\nincorporate discounting,\nprimarily utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default, loss\ngiven default and exposure at\ndefault. This change resulted\nin a decrease to the ACLL and\ndeferred tax assets of\napproximately $ 350million and\n$ 100million, respectively,\nand an increase to retained\nearnings and other assets of\napproximately $ 300million and\n$ 50million, respectively, on\nJanuary 1, 2023. The ACLL for\ncorporate loans was unaffected\nbecause the measurement\napproach used for corporate\nloans is not in the scope of\nthis ASU. The ASU also\nrequires disclosure of\nmodifications of loans to\nborrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty if the\nmodification involves\nprincipal forgiveness, an\ninterest rate reduction, an\nother-than-insignificant\npayment delay, a term\nextension or a combination of\nthose types of modifications.\nIn addition, the ASU requires\nthe disclosure of current-\nperiod gross write-offs by\nyear of loan origination\n(vintage). The amendments\nrelated to disclosures are\nrequired to be applied\nprospectively beginning as of\nthe date of adoption. Citi\nwill present the new\ndisclosures for periods\nbeginning on and after January\n1, 2023. Fair Value\nHedging\u2014Portfolio Layer Method\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-01, Derivatives\nand Hedging (Topic 815): Fair\nValue Hedging\u2014Portfolio Layer\nMethod , intended to better\nalign hedge accounting with an\norganization\u2019s risk management\nstrategies. Specifically, the\nguidance expands the current\nsingle-layer method to allow\nmultiple hedge layers of a\nsingle closed portfolio of\nqualifying assets, which\ninclude both prepayable and\nnon-prepayable assets. Upon\nthe adoption of the guidance,\nentities may elect to\nreclassify securities held-to-\nmaturity to the available-for-\nsale category provided that\nthe reclassified securities\nare designated in a portfolio\nhedge. Coincident with the\nadoption of this ASU, on\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi\ntransferred HTM mortgage-\nbacked securities with an\namortized cost and fair value\nof approximately $ 3.3billion\nand $ 3.4billion,\nrespectively, into AFS as\npermitted under the guidance,\nand hedged them under the\nportfolio layer method.\n\nFair Value Measurement of\nEquity Securities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-3, Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\n. The ASU was issued to\naddress diversity in practice\nwhereby certain entities\nincluded the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when\nvaluing equity securities, and\nit clarifies that a\ncontractual restriction on the\nsale of an equity security\nshould not be considered part\nof the unit of account of the\nequity security and,\ntherefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair\nvalue. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to\ndisclose the fair value of\nequity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions,\nthe nature and remaining\nduration of the restrictions\nand the circumstances that\ncould cause a lapse in the\nrestrictions. The ASU is to be\nadopted on a prospective basis\nand will be effective for Citi\non January 1, 2024, although\nearly adoption is permitted.\nAdoption of the accounting\nstandard is not expected to\nhave an impact on Citi\u2019s\noperating results or financial\nposition, as the Company\nexcludes such restrictions\nwhen valuing equity\nsecurities. Long-Duration\nInsurance Contracts In August\n2018, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2018-12, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Targeted\nImprovements to the Accounting\nfor Long-Duration Contracts ,\nwhich changes the existing\nrecognition, measurement,\npresentation and disclosures\nfor long-duration contracts\nissued by an insurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i)\nimproves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the\nliability for future policy\nbenefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future\ncash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the\naccounting for certain market-\nbased options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or\naccount balance) contracts,\n(iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred\nacquisition costs and (iv)\nintroduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries,\nprimarily in Mexico, that\nissue long-duration insurance\ncontracts such as traditional\nlife insurance policies and\nlife-contingent annuity\ncontracts that are impacted by\nthe requirements of ASU\n2018-12.\n\nThe effective date of ASU\n2018-12 was deferred for all\ninsurance entities by ASU\n2019-09, Finance\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate (issued in October 2019)\nand by ASU 2020-11, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Effective\nDate and Early Application\n(issued in November 2020).\nCiti adopted the targeted\nimprovements in ASU 2018-12 on\nJanuary 1, 2023. There was no\nmaterial impact to Citi\u2019s\nfinancial position upon\nadoption, and Citi expects no\nmaterial impact to its results\nof operations as a result of\nadopting the amendments.\n                              158                               \n2.

As a result, a CTA\nloss (net of hedges) in AOCI\nof approximately $ 400million\npretax ($ 345million after-\ntax) related to the legacy\noperation was released to\nearnings in 2022. Out of the\ntotal CTA release, a $\n260million pretax loss ($\n221million after-tax loss) was\nattributable to the Egg\nBanking business noted above,\nreported in Discontinued\noperations and, therefore, the\ncorresponding CTA release was\nalso reported in Discontinued\noperations during 2022. The\nremaining CTA release of a $\n140million pretax loss ($\n124million after-tax loss)\nrelated to Legacy Holdings\nAssets was reported as part of\nContinuing operations within\nLegacy Franchises .\n\nWhile the legacy operation was\ndivested in multiple sales\nover the years, each\ntransaction did not result in\nsubstantial liquidation given\nthat Citi retained certain\nliabilities noted above, which\nwere gradually settled over\ntime until reaching the point\nof substantial liquidation\nduring 2022, triggering the\nrelease of the CTA loss to\nearnings.\n\nCash flows from Discontinued\noperations were not material\nfor any period presented.\n                              159                               \nSignificant Disposals As of December 31, 2022, Citi had entered\ninto sale agreements for nineconsumer banking businesses within\nLegacy Franchises .

As part\nof the wind-down, Citi is also\nactively pursuing sales of\ncertain Russian consumer\nbanking portfolios. On October\n14, 2022, Citi disclosed that\nit will be ending nearly all\nof the institutional banking\nservices it offers in Russia\nby the end of the first\nquarter of 2023. Going\nforward, Citi\u2019s only\noperations in Russia will be\nthose necessary to fulfill its\nremaining legal and regulatory\nobligations.

COMMISSIONS AND FEES;\nADMINISTRATION AND OTHER\nFIDUCIARY FEES\n\nCommissions and Fees The\nprimary components of\nCommissions and fees revenue\nare investment banking fees,\nbrokerage commissions, credit\ncard and bank card income and\ndeposit-related fees.\nInvestment banking fees are\nsubstantially composed of\nunderwriting and advisory\nrevenues. Such fees are\nrecognized at the point in\ntime when Citigroup\u2019s\nperformance under the terms of\na contractual arrangement is\ncompleted, which is typically\nat the closing of a\ntransaction. Reimbursed\nexpenses related to these\ntransactions are recorded as\nrevenue and are included\nwithin investment banking\nfees. In certain instances for\nadvisory contracts, Citi will\nreceive amounts in advance of\nthe deal\u2019s closing. In these\ninstances, the amounts\nreceived will be recognized as\na liability and not recognized\nin revenue until the\ntransaction closes. For the\nperiods presented, the\ncontract liability amount was\nnegligible. Out-of-pocket\nexpenses associated with\nunderwriting activity are\ndeferred and recognized at the\ntime the related revenue is\nrecognized, while out-of-\npocket expenses associated\nwith advisory arrangements are\nexpensed as incurred. In\ngeneral, expenses incurred\nrelated to investment banking\ntransactions, whether\nconsummated or not, are\nrecorded in Other operating\nexpenses . The Company has\ndetermined that it acts as\nprincipal in the majority of\nthese transactions and\ntherefore presents expenses\ngross within Other operating\nexpenses . Brokerage\ncommissions primarily include\ncommissions and fees from the\nfollowing: executing\ntransactions for clients on\nexchanges and over-the-counter\nmarkets; sales of mutual funds\nand other annuity products;\nand assisting clients in\nclearing transactions,\nproviding brokerage services\nand other such activities.\nBrokerage commissions are\nrecognized in Commissions and\nfees at the point in time the\nassociated service is\nfulfilled, generally on the\ntrade execution date. Sales of\ncertain investment products\ninclude a portion of variable\nconsideration associated with\nthe underlying product. In\nthese instances, a portion of\nthe revenue associated with\nthe sale of the product is not\nrecognized until the variable\nconsideration becomes fixed\nand determinable. The Company\nrecognized $ 538million, $\n639million and $ 495million of\nrevenue related to such\nvariable consideration for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThese amounts primarily relate\nto performance obligations\nsatisfied in prior periods.\nCredit card and bank card\nincome is primarily composed\nof interchange fees, which are\nearned by card issuers based\non purchase sales, and certain\ncard fees, including annual\nfees. Costs related to\ncustomer reward programs and\ncertain payments to partners\n(primarily based on program\nsales, profitability and\ncustomer acquisitions) are\nrecorded as a reduction of\ncredit card and bank card\nincome. Citi\u2019s credit card\nprograms have certain partner\nsharing agreements that vary\nby partner. These partner\nsharing agreements are subject\nto contractually based\nperformance thresholds that,\nif met, would require Citi to\nmake ongoing payments to the\npartner. The threshold is\nbased on the profitability of\na program and is generally\ncalculated based on predefined\nprogram revenues\n\nless predefined program\nexpenses. In most of Citi\u2019s\npartner sharing agreements,\nprogram expenses include net\ncredit losses, which, to the\nextent that the increase in\nnet credit losses reduces\nCiti\u2019s liability for the\npartners\u2019 share for a given\nprogram year, would generally\nresult in lower payments to\npartners in total for that\nyear and vice versa. Further,\nin some instances, other\npartner payments are based on\nprogram sales and new account\nacquisitions. Interchange\nrevenues are recognized as\nearned on a daily basis when\nCiti\u2019s performance obligation\nto transmit funds to the\npayment networks has been\nsatisfied. Annual card fees,\nnet of origination costs, are\ndeferred and amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over a\n12-month period. Costs related\nto card reward programs are\nrecognized when the rewards\nare earned by the cardholders.\nPayments to partners are\nrecognized when incurred.\nDeposit-related fees consist\nof service charges on deposit\naccounts and fees earned from\nperforming cash management\nactivities and other deposit\naccount services. Such fees\nare recognized in the period\nin which the related service\nis provided. Transactional\nservice fees primarily consist\nof fees charged for processing\nservices such as cash\nmanagement, global payments,\nclearing, international funds\ntransfer and other trade\nservices. Such fees are\nrecognized as/when the\nassociated service is\nsatisfied, which normally\noccurs at the point in time\nthe service is requested by\nthe customer and provided by\nCiti. Insurance distribution\nrevenue consists of\ncommissions earned from third-\nparty insurance companies for\nmarketing and selling\ninsurance policies on behalf\nof such entities. Such\ncommissions are recognized in\nCommissions and fees at the\npoint in time the associated\nservice is fulfilled,\ngenerally when the insurance\npolicy is sold to the\npolicyholder.

These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that an increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other\npartner payments are based on program sales and new account\nacquisitions.\n(2) Includes overdraft fees of $ 59million (prior to the\nelimination of overdraft fees in June 2022), $ 107million and $\n100million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.

The custody product is composed of numerous\nservices related to the administration, safekeeping and\nreporting for both U.S. and non-U.S. denominated securities. The\nservices offered to clients include trade settlement,\nsafekeeping, income collection, corporate action notification,\nrecord-keeping and reporting, tax reporting and cash management.\nThese services are provided for a wide range of securities,\nincluding but not limited to equities, municipal and corporate\nbonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, money market\ninstruments, U.S. Treasuries and agencies, derivative\ninstruments, mutual funds, alternative investments and precious\nmetals. Custody fees are recognized as or when the associated\npromised service is satisfied, which normally occurs at the\npoint in time the service is requested by the customer and\nprovided by Citi. Fiduciary fees consist of trust services and\ninvestment management services. As an escrow agent, Citi\nreceives, safekeeps, services and manages clients\u2019 escrowed\nassets, such as cash, securities, property (including\nintellectual property), contracts or other collateral. Citi\nperforms its escrow agent duties by safekeeping the assets\nduring the specified time period agreed upon by all parties and\ntherefore earns its revenue evenly during the contract duration.\nInvestment management services consist of managing assets on\nbehalf of Citi\u2019s retail and institutional clients. Revenue from\nthese services primarily consists of asset-based fees for\nadvisory accounts, which are based on the market value of the\nclient\u2019s assets and recognized monthly, when the market value is\nfixed. In some instances, the Company contracts with third-party\nadvisors and with third-party custodians. The Company has\ndetermined that it acts as principal in the majority of these\ntransactions and therefore presents the amounts paid to third\nparties gross within Other operating expenses .

INCENTIVE PLANS\nDiscretionary Annual Incentive\nAwards Citigroup grants\nimmediate cash bonus payments\nand various forms of immediate\nand deferred awards as part of\nits discretionary annual\nincentive award program\ninvolving a large segment of\nCitigroup\u2019s employees\nworldwide. Discretionary\nannual incentive awards are\ngenerally awarded in the first\nquarter of the year based on\nthe previous year\u2019s\nperformance. Awards valued at\nless than U.S. $ 75,000(or the\nlocal currency equivalent) are\ngenerally paid entirely in the\nform of an immediate cash\nbonus. Pursuant to Citigroup\npolicy and/or regulatory\nrequirements, certain\nemployees are subject to\nmandatory deferrals of\nincentive pay and generally\nreceive 15%\u2013 60% of their\nawards in the form of deferred\nstock or deferred cash stock\nunits. Discretionary annual\nincentive awards to certain\nemployees in the EU are\nsubject to deferral\nrequirements regardless of the\ntotal award value, with at\nleast 50% of the immediate\nincentive delivered in the\nform of a stock payment award\nsubject to a restriction on\nsale or transfer (generally,\nfor 12months). For incentive\nawards granted in 2022,\nCitigroup changed the annual\ndeferred compensation\nstructure from granting\ndeferred cash awards for\ncertain regulated employees to\ndeferred stock awards. Certain\nemployees located in countries\nthat have regulations or tax\nadvantages for offering\ndeferred cash or deferred cash\nstock units received those\ntypes of awards as a part of\ntheir annual incentive\ncompensation rather than\ndeferred stock. Subject to\ncertain exceptions\n(principally, for retirement-\neligible employees),\ncontinuous employment within\nCitigroup is required to vest\nin deferred annual incentive\nawards. Post employment\nvesting by retirement-eligible\nemployees and participants who\nmeet other conditions is\ngenerally conditioned upon\ntheir compliance with certain\nrestrictions during the\nremaining vesting period.\nGenerally, the deferred awards\nvest in equal annual\ninstallments over three- or\nfour-yearperiods. Vested stock\nawards are delivered in shares\nof common stock. Deferred cash\nawards are payable in cash\nand, except as prohibited by\napplicable regulatory\nguidance, earn a fixed\nnotional rate of interest that\nis paid only if and when the\nunderlying principal award\namount vests. Deferred cash\nstock unit awards are payable\nin cash at the vesting value\nof the underlying stock.\nGenerally, in the EU, vested\nshares are subject to a\nrestriction on sale or\ntransfer after vesting, and\nvested deferred cash awards\nand deferred cash stock units\nare subject to hold back\n(generally, for 6or 12months\nbased on the award type).\nStock awards, deferred cash\nstock units and deferred cash\nawards are subject to one or\nmore cancellation and clawback\nprovisions that apply in\ncertain circumstances,\nincluding gross misconduct.\n\nOutstanding (Unvested) Stock\nAwards\nA summary of the status of\nunvested stock awards granted\nas discretionary annual\nincentive or sign-on and\nreplacement awards is\npresented below:\n                                                                \n                                                     Weighted-  \n                                                 average\u00a0grant  \n                                                     date\u00a0fair  \n  Unvested\u00a0stock\u00a0awards           Shares       value per share  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unvested at December\u00a0       31,644,684    $            66.22  \n  31, 2021                                                      \n  Granted(1)                  25,729,643                 65.07  \n  Canceled                    -2,007,260                 65.94  \n  Vested(2)                  -13,458,860                 67.17  \n  Unvested at December\u00a0       41,908,207    $            65.23  \n  31, 2022                                                      \n                                                                \n(1) The weighted-average fair\nvalue of the shares granted\nduring 2021 and 2020 was $\n62.10and $ 76.68,\nrespectively.\n(2) The weighted-average fair\nvalue of the shares vesting\nduring 2022 was approximately\n$ 64.13per share on the\nvesting date, compared to $\n67.17on the grant date.\nTotal unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to\nunvested stock awards was $\n862million at December 31,\n2022.

For PSUs\nawarded in 2019 and 2020,\nthose metrics were return on\ntangible common equity and\nearnings per share. For PSUs\nawards in 2021 and 2022, the\nmetrics were return on\ntangible common equity and\ntangible book value per share.\nIn each year, the metrics were\nequally weighted.\n\nFor all award years, if the\ntotal shareholder return is\nnegative over the three-\nyearperformance period,\nexecutives may earn no more\nthan 100% of the target PSUs,\nregardless of the extent to\nwhich Citigroup outperforms\nagainst performance goals\nand/or peer firms. The number\nof PSUs ultimately earned\ncould vary from zero, if\nperformance goals are not met,\nto as much as 150% of target,\nif performance goals are\nmeaningfully exceeded. The\nreported financial metrics\nduring the performance period\nare adjusted to reflect an\nequitable adjustment as\nrequired under the applicable\naward agreements for unusual\nand non-recurring items,\nincluding divestitures, as\nwell as accounting rule and\ntax law changes.\n\nFor all award years, the value\nof each PSU is equal to the\nvalue of oneshare of Citi\ncommon stock. Dividend\nequivalents are accrued and\npaid on the number of earned\nPSUs after the end of the\nperformance period.\n                              169                               \nPSUs are subject to variable\naccounting, pursuant to which\nthe associated value of the\naward will fluctuate with\nchanges in Citigroup\u2019s stock\nprice and the attainment of\nthe specified performance\ngoals for each award. The\naward is settled solely in\ncash after the end of each\nperformance period. The value\nof the award, subject to the\nperformance goals and taking\ninto account any mandatory\nequitable adjustments as per\nthe terms of the award\nagreement, is estimated using\na simulation model that\nincorporates multiple\nvaluation assumptions,\nincluding the probability of\nachieving the specified\nperformance goals of each\naward. The risk-free rate used\nin the model is based on the\napplicable U.S. Treasury yield\ncurve. Other significant\nassumptions for the awards are\nas follows:\n                                                               \n  Valuation assumptions       2022        2021        2020     \n  Expected volatility        37.01  %    40.88  %    22.26  %  \n  Expected dividend yield     2.96        4.21        2.82     \n                                                               \nA summary of the performance share unit activity for 2022 is\npresented below:\n                                                                \n                                                     Weighted-  \n                                                 average\u00a0grant  \n                                                     date\u00a0fair  \n  Performance share units           Units       value per unit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Outstanding, beginning of     1,274,273    $           77.67  \n  year                                                          \n  Granted(1)                      531,824                71.04  \n  Canceled                        -62,875                72.83  \n  Payments(2)                    -461,087                72.83  \n  Outstanding, end of year      1,282,135    $           76.90  \n                                                                \n(1) The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value per unit\nawarded in 2021 and 2020 was $\n78.55and $ 83.45,\nrespectively.\n\n(2) The value of the payments\nwas approximately $ 32million.\n\nTransformation Program In\norder to provide an incentive\nfor select employees to\neffectively execute Citi\u2019s\ntransformation program, in\nAugust 2021 the Personnel and\nCompensation (P&C) Committee\nof Citigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors, the predecessor of\nthe Compensation, Performance\nManagement and Culture (CPC)\nCommittee of Citigroup\u2019s Board\nof Directors, approved a\nprogram for them to earn\nadditional compensation based\non the achievement of Citi\u2019s\ntransformation goals from\nAugust 2021 through December\n2024 and satisfaction of other\nconditions. Performance under\nthe program is divided into\nthree consecutive periods,\nending on December 31, 2022,\n2023 and 2024. The awards are\nsubject to variable\naccounting, pursuant to which\nthe associated value of the\naward will fluctuate with the\nattainment of the performance\nconditions for each tranche\nand changes to Citigroup\u2019s\nstock price for the third\ntranche. Payment for each\nperiod will be in cash, in a\nlump sum, with the third\npayment indexed to changes in\nthe value of Citi\u2019s common\nstock from the service\ninception date through the\npayment date. Earnings\ngenerally will be based on\ncollective performance with\nrespect to Citi\u2019s\ntransformation goals and will\nbe evaluated and approved by\nthe CPC Committee on an annual\nbasis.\n\nPayments in the event of any\ncategory of employment\ntermination or change in job\ntitle or employment status are\nsubject to Citi\u2019s discretion.\nCancellation and clawback are\nprovided for in the event of\nmisconduct and certain other\ncircumstances. The program\napplies to senior leaders,\nother than the CEO, critical\nto helping deliver a\nsuccessful transformation with\nthe value varying based on\nindividual compensation\nlevels. Stock Option Program\nAll outstanding options were\nfully vested at December 31,\n2020 and exercised during\n2021, with none outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nOther Variable Incentive\nCompensation Citigroup has\nvarious incentive plans\nglobally that are used to\nmotivate and reward\nperformance primarily in the\nareas of sales, operational\nexcellence and customer\nsatisfaction. Participation in\nthese plans is generally\nlimited to employees who are\nnot eligible for discretionary\nannual incentive awards. Other\nforms of variable compensation\ninclude commissions paid to\nfinancial advisors and\nmortgage loan officers.\nSummary Except for awards\nsubject to variable\naccounting, the total expense\nrecognized for stock awards\nrepresents the grant date fair\nvalue of such awards, which is\ngenerally recognized as a\ncharge to income ratably over\nthe vesting period, other than\nfor awards to retirement-\neligible employees and\nimmediately vested awards.\nWhenever awards are granted or\nare expected to be granted to\nretirement-eligible employees,\nthe charge to income is\naccelerated based on when the\napplicable conditions for\nretirement eligibility were or\nwill be met. If the employee\nis retirement eligible on the\ngrant date, or the award is\nvested at the grant date, Citi\nrecognizes the expense each\nyear equal to the grant date\nfair value of the awards that\nit estimates will be granted\nin the following year.\nRecipients of Citigroup stock\nawards generally do not have\nany stockholder rights until\nshares are delivered upon\nvesting or exercise.\nRecipients of deferred stock\nawards and deferred cash stock\nunit awards, however, may,\nexcept as prohibited by\napplicable regulatory\nguidance, be entitled to\nreceive or accrue dividend-\nequivalent payments during the\nvesting period. Recipients of\nstock payment awards and other\nstock awards subject to a\nsale-restriction period are\ngenerally entitled to vote the\nshares in their award and\nreceive dividends on such\nshares during the sale-\nrestriction period. Once a\nstock award vests, the shares\ndelivered to the participant\nare freely transferable,\nunless they are subject to a\nrestriction on sale or\ntransfer for a specified\nperiod. All equity awards\ngranted since April 19, 2005\nhave been made pursuant to\nstockholder-approved stock\nincentive plans that are\nadministered by the CPC\nCommittee (or its\npredecessor), which is\ncomposed entirely of\nindependent non-employee\ndirectors. On December 31,\n2022, approximately\n48.0million shares of\nCitigroup common stock were\nauthorized and available for\ngrant under Citigroup\u2019s 2019\nStock Incentive Plan, the only\nplan from which equity awards\nare currently granted.\n                              170                               \nThe 2019 Stock Incentive Plan\nand predecessor plans permit\nthe use of treasury stock or\nnewly issued shares in\nconnection with awards granted\nunder the plans. Treasury\nshares were used to settle\nvestings from 2018 to 2021,\nand for the first quarter of\n2022, except where local laws\nfavor newly issued shares. The\nuse of treasury stock or newly\nissued shares to settle stock\nawards does not affect the\ncompensation expense recorded\nin the Consolidated Statement\nof Income for equity awards.\n\nIncentive Compensation Cost\nThe following table shows\ncomponents of compensation\nexpense, relating to certain\nof the incentive compensation\nprograms described above:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0dollars          2022        2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Charges for estimated                                         \n  awards to                   $    742    $    807    $    748  \n  retirement-eligible                                           \n  employees                                                     \n  Amortization of deferred                                      \n  cash awards,                                                  \n  deferred cash stock              463         384         201  \n  units and                                                     \n  performance stock units                                       \n  Immediately vested stock                                      \n  award                            101          99          95  \n  expense(1)                                                    \n  Amortization of                                               \n  restricted and deferred          533         395         420  \n  stock awards(2)                                               \n  Other variable incentive         304         435         627  \n  compensation                                                  \n  Total                       $  2,143    $  2,120    $  2,091  \n                                                                \n(1) Represents expense for\nimmediately vested stock\nawards that generally were\nstock payments in lieu of cash\ncompensation.

Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s Significant Plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n(2) Actuarial gain was primarily due to the increase in global\ndiscount rates partially offset by lower than expected asset\nreturns.\n(3) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n(4) Curtailment and settlement relate to divestiture activities.\n(5) The U.S. qualified plan was fully funded as of January 1,\n2022 and no minimum funding was required for 2022. The plan is\nalso expected to be fully funded as of January 1, 2023 with no\nexpected minimum funding requirement for 2023.\n                              173                               \nThe following table shows the change in AOCI related to the\nCompany\u2019s pension, postretirement and post employment plans:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0                                               \n  dollars                       2022         2021         2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Beginning of year                                             \n  balance, net of          $  -5,852    $  -6,864    $  -6,809  \n  tax(1)(2)                                                     \n  Actuarial assumptions                                         \n  changes and plan             3,923          963       -1,464  \n  experience                                                    \n  Net asset gain (loss)                                         \n  due to difference           -4,225         -148        1,076  \n  between actual and                                            \n  expected returns                                              \n  Net amortization               198          280          318  \n  Prior service credit             \u2014           -7          108  \n  (cost)                                                        \n  Curtailment/settleme\u2026          -37           11           -8  \n  gain (loss)(3)                                                \n  Foreign exchange               172          153         -108  \n  impact and other                                              \n  Change in deferred              66         -240           23  \n  taxes, net                                                    \n  Change, net of tax       $      97    $   1,012    $     -55  \n  End of year balance,     $  -5,755    $  -5,852    $  -6,864  \n  net of tax(1)(2)                                              \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 for further discussion of net AOCI balance.\n(2) Includes net-of-tax amounts for certain profit-sharing plans\noutside the U.S.\n(3) Curtailment and settlement relate to divestiture activities.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate projected benefit\nobligation (PBO), the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation\n(ABO) and the aggregate fair value of plan assets are presented\nfor all defined benefit pension plans with a PBO in excess of\nplan assets and for all defined benefit pension plans with an\nABO in excess of plan assets as follows:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026               \u2026                                      \n         \u2026               \u2026                                      \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2014       \u2014       \u2026       \u2026                              \n                                                                \n(1) As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, only the nonqualified\nplans\u2019 PBO and ABO exceeded plan assets.\nPlan Assumptions The Company utilizes a number of assumptions to\ndetermine plan obligations and expenses. Changes in one or a\ncombination of these assumptions will have an impact on the\nCompany\u2019s pension and postretirement PBO, funded status and\n(benefit) expense. Changes in the plans\u2019 funded status resulting\nfrom changes in the PBO and fair value of plan assets will have\na corresponding impact on Accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) . The actuarial assumptions at the respective years ended\nDecember 31 in the table below are used to measure the year-end\nPBO and the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent\nyear (period). Since Citi\u2019s Significant Plans are measured on a\nquarterly basis, the year-end rates for those plans are used to\ncalculate the net periodic (benefit) expense for the subsequent\nyear\u2019s first quarter. As a result of the quarterly measurement\nprocess, the net periodic (benefit) expense for the Significant\nPlans is calculated at each respective quarter end based on the\npreceding quarter-end rates (as shown below for the U.S. and\nnon-U.S. pension and postretirement plans).

The discount rates\nfor the non-U.S. pension and\npostretirement plans are\nselected by reference to each\nplan\u2019s specific cash flows and\na market-based yield curve\ndeveloped from the available\nlocal high-quality corporate\nbonds. However, where\ndeveloped corporate bond\nmarkets do not exist, the\ndiscount rates are selected by\nreference to local government\nbonds with an estimated\npremium added to reflect the\nadditional risk for corporate\nbonds in certain countries.\nWhere available, the resulting\nplan yields by jurisdiction\nare compared with published,\nhigh-quality corporate bond\nindices for reasonableness.\nExpected Return on Assets The\nCompany determines its\nassumptions for the expected\nreturn on assets for its U.S.\npension and postretirement\nplans using a \u201cbuilding block\u201d\napproach, which focuses on\nranges of anticipated rates of\nreturn for each asset class. A\nweighted average range of\nnominal rates is then\ndetermined based on target\nallocations to each asset\nclass. Market performance over\na number of earlier years is\nevaluated covering a wide\nrange of economic conditions\nto determine whether there are\nsound reasons for projecting\nany past trends. The Company\nconsiders the expected return\non assets to be a long-term\nassessment of return\nexpectations and does not\nanticipate changing this\nassumption unless there are\nsignificant changes in\ninvestment strategy or\neconomic conditions. This\ncontrasts with the selection\nof the discount rate and\ncertain other assumptions,\nwhich are reconsidered\nannually (or quarterly for the\nSignificant Plans) in\naccordance with GAAP. The\nexpected return on assets\nreflects the expected annual\nappreciation of the plan\nassets and reduces the\nCompany\u2019s annual pension\nexpense. The expected return\non assets is deducted from the\nsum of service cost, interest\ncost and other components of\npension expense to arrive at\nthe net pension (benefit)\nexpense.\nThe following table shows the expected return on assets used in\ndetermining the Company\u2019s pension expense compared to the actual\nreturn on assets during 2022, 2021 and 2020 for the U.S. pension\nand postretirement plans:\n                                                                \n  U.S. plans              2022                   2021     2020  \n  (During the year)                                             \n  Expected return on                                            \n  assets                                                        \n  U.S. pension and                                              \n  postretirement         5.00%    5.80%/5.60%/5.60%/\u2026    6.70%  \n  trust                                                         \n  VEBA Trust(2)           1.50                   1.50     3.00  \n  Actual return on                                              \n  assets(1)                                                     \n  U.S. pension and                                              \n  postretirement        -15.52                   5.14    12.84  \n  trust                                                         \n  VEBA Trust              1.40                   1.52     2.11  \n                                                                \n(1) Actual return on assets is presented net of fees.\n(2) The expected return on\nassets for the VEBA Trust was\nadjusted from 1.50% to 3.00%\neffective January 1, 2023 to\nreflect significant change in\neconomic condition.\nSensitivities of Certain Key\nAssumptions\nThe following tables summarize the effect on pension expense:\n                                                                \n                           Discount rate                        \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0               increase                        \n  dollars                           2022       2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. plans         $                27    $    35    $    34  \n  Non-U.S. plans                      -5         -4        -16  \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n                                decrease                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0                   2022       2021       2020  \n  dollars                                                       \n  U.S. plans         $               -34    $   -49    $   -52  \n  Non-U.S. plans                      15         25         25  \n                                                                \nThe U.S. Qualified Pension\nPlan was frozen in 2008, and\nas a result, most of the\nprospective service costs have\nbeen eliminated and the\ngain/loss amortization period\nwas changed to the life\nexpectancy for inactive\nparticipants. As a result,\npension expense for the U.S.\nQualified Pension Plan is\ndriven more by interest costs\nthan service costs, and an\nincrease in the discount rate\nwould increase pension\nexpense, while a decrease in\ndiscount rate would decrease\npension expense. For Non-U.S.\nPension Plans that are not\nfrozen (in countries such as\nMexico, the U.K. and South\nKorea), there is more service\ncost. The pension expense for\nthe Non-U.S. Plans is driven\nby both service cost and\ninterest cost. An increase in\nthe discount rate generally\ndecreases pension expense due\nto the greater impact on\nservice cost compared to\ninterest cost.\nThe following tables summarize the effect on pension expense:\n                                                                \n                         Expected return                        \n                               on assets                        \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0               increase                        \n  dollars                           2022       2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.S. plans         $              -123    $  -124    $  -123  \n  Non-U.S. plans                     -60        -70        -66  \n                        One-percentage-\u2026                        \n                                decrease                        \n  In\u00a0millions\u00a0of\u00a0                   2022       2021       2020  \n  dollars                                                       \n  U.S. plans         $               123    $   124    $   123  \n  Non-U.S. plans                      60         70         66  \n                                                                \n                              176                               \nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate\nAssumed health care cost trend\nrates were as follows:\n                                                             \n                                              2022     2021  \n  Health care\u00a0cost\u00a0increase\u00a0rate\u00a0for                         \n  U.S.\u00a0plans                                                 \n  Following year                             7.00%    6.25%  \n  Ultimate rate to which cost increase is     5.00     5.00  \n  assumed to decline                                         \n  Year in which the ultimate rate is          2031     2027  \n  reached                                                    \n  Health care\u00a0cost\u00a0increase\u00a0rate\u00a0for                         \n  non-U.S.\u00a0plans (weighted average)                          \n  Following year                             7.05%    6.92%  \n  Ultimate rate to which cost increase is     7.05     6.92  \n  assumed to decline                                         \n  Year in which the ultimate rate             2023     2022  \n  is reached                                                 \n                                                             \nInterest Crediting Rate\nThe Company has cash balance\nplans and other plans with\npromised interest crediting\nrates.

and\npostretirement funds\u2019\ninvestment strategy is to\ninvest in a prudent manner for\nthe exclusive purpose of\nproviding benefits to\nparticipants. The investment\nstrategies are targeted to\nproduce a total return that,\nwhen combined with the\nCompany\u2019s contributions to the\nfunds, will maintain the\nfunds\u2019 ability to meet all\nrequired benefit obligations.\nRisk is controlled through\ndiversification of asset types\nand investments in domestic\nand international equities,\nfixed income securities and\ncash and short-term\ninvestments. The target asset\nallocation in most locations\noutside the U.S. is primarily\nin equity and debt securities.\nThese allocations may vary by\ngeographic region and country\ndepending on the nature of\napplicable obligations and\nvarious other regional\nconsiderations. The wide\nvariation in the actual range\nof plan asset allocations for\nthe funded non-U.S. plans is a\nresult of differing local\nstatutory requirements and\neconomic conditions. For\nexample, in certain countries\nlocal law requires that all\npension plan assets must be\ninvested in fixed income\ninvestments, government funds\nor local-country securities.\nSignificant Concentrations of\nRisk in Plan Assets The assets\nof the Company\u2019s pension plans\nare diversified to limit the\nimpact of any individual\ninvestment.

It is thus reasonably possible that significant changes\nin the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur\nwithin the next 12 months. The potential range of amounts that\ncould affect Citi\u2019s effective tax rate is between $ 0and $\n500million.\nThe following are the major\ntax jurisdictions in which the\nCompany and its affiliates\noperate and the earliest tax\nyear subject to examination:\n                                             \n  Jurisdiction               Tax\u00a0year        \n  United States                        2016  \n  Mexico                               2017  \n  New York State and City              2009  \n  United Kingdom                       2016  \n  India                                2021  \n  Singapore                            2021  \n  Hong Kong                            2016  \n  Ireland                              2018  \n                                             \n                              185                               \nNon-U.S. Earnings Non-U.S.\npretax earnings approximated $\n16.2billion in 2022, $\n12.9billion in 2021 and $\n13.8billion in 2020. As a U.S.\ncorporation, Citigroup and its\nU.S. subsidiaries are\ncurrently subject to U.S.\ntaxation on all non-U.S.\npretax earnings of non-U.S.\nbranches. Beginning in 2018,\nthere is a separate foreign\ntax credit (FTC) basket for\nbranches. Also, dividends from\na non-U.S. subsidiary or\naffiliate are effectively\nexempt from U.S. taxation. The\nCompany provides income taxes\non the book over tax basis\ndifferences of non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries except to the\nextent that such differences\nare indefinitely reinvested\noutside the U.S. At December\n31, 2022, $ 5.9billion of\nbasis differences of non-U.S.\nentities was indefinitely\ninvested. At the existing tax\nrates (including withholding\ntaxes), additional taxes (net\nof U.S. FTCs and valuation\nallowances) of $ 2.4billion\nwould have to be provided if\nsuch assertions were reversed.\nDeferred Tax Assets As of\nDecember 31, 2022, Citi had a\nvaluation allowance of $\n2.4billion, composed of\nvaluation allowances of $\n0.9billion on its branch\nbasket FTC carry-forwards, $\n1.0billion on its U.S.\nresidual DTA related to its\nnon-U.S. branches, $\n0.4billion on local non-U.S.\nDTAs and $ 0.1billion on state\nnet operating loss carry-\nforwards. There was a decrease\nof $ 1.8billion from the\nDecember 31, 2021 balance of $\n4.2billion. The amount of\nCiti\u2019s valuation allowances\n(VA) may change in future\nyears. In 2022, Citi\u2019s VA for\ncarry-forward FTCs in its\nbranch basket decreased by $\n0.8billion, primarily due to\ncarry-forward expirations. The\nlevel of branch pretax income,\nthe local branch tax rate and\nthe allocations of overall\ndomestic losses (ODL) and\nexpenses for U.S. tax purposes\nto the branch basket are the\nmain factors in determining\nthe branch VA. There was no\nbranch basket VA release in\n2022. In Citi\u2019s general basket\nfor FTCs, changes in the\nforecasted amount of income in\nU.S. locations derived from\nsources outside the U.S., in\naddition to tax examination\nchanges from prior years,\ncould alter the amount of VA\nthat is needed against such\nFTCs. The remaining VA for the\ngeneral basket of $ 0.8billion\nwas released, primarily due to\nincreases in interest rates\nand prior-year audit\nadjustments. The non-U.S.\nlocal VA decreased by $\n0.2billion.\nThe following table summarizes Citi\u2019s DTAs:\n                                                                \n  In\u00a0billions\u00a0of\u00a0

the passage of time. Although realization is\nnot assured, Citi believes that the realization of the\nrecognized net DTAs of $ 27.7billion at December 31, 2022 is\nmore-likely-than-not, based upon expectations as to future\ntaxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise and\nconsideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined\nin ASC 740, Income Taxes ). The majority of Citi\u2019s U.S. federal\nnet operating loss carry-forward and all of its New York State\nand City net operating loss carry-forwards are subject to a\ncarry-forward period of 20years. This provides enough time to\nfully utilize the DTAs pertaining to these existing NOL carry-\nforwards. This is due to Citi\u2019s forecast of sufficient U.S.\ntaxable income and because New York State and City continue to\ntax Citi\u2019s non-U.S. income. With respect to the FTCs component\nof the DTAs, the carry-forward period is 10years. Utilization of\nFTCs in any year is generally limited to 21% of foreign source\ntaxable income in that year. However, ODL that Citi has incurred\nof approximately $ 8billion as of December 31, 2022 are allowed\nto be reclassified as foreign source income to the extent of\n50%\u2013 100% (at taxpayer\u2019s election) of domestic source income\nproduced in subsequent years. Such resulting foreign source\nincome would support the realization of the FTC carry-forwards\nafter VA. As noted in the tables above, Citi\u2019s FTC carry-\nforwards were $ 1.9billion ($ 2.8billion before VA) as of\nDecember 31, 2022, compared to $ 2.8billion ($ 5.3billion before\nVA) as of December 31, 2021. Citi believes that it will more-\nlikely-than-not generate sufficient U.S. taxable income within\nthe 10-year carry-forward period to be able to utilize the net\nFTCs after the VA, after considering any FTCs produced in the\ntax return for such period, which must be used prior to any\ncarry-forward utilization.\n                              187                               \n                                                                \n  10.

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 15 for further\ninformation.\nThe resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized\nfinancing transactions. Citi executes these transactions\nprimarily through its broker-dealer subsidiaries to facilitate\ncustomer matched-book activity and to efficiently fund a portion\nof Citi\u2019s trading inventory. Transactions executed by Citi\u2019s\nbank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing\nactivity.\n\nTo maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market\nconditions, including under periods of stress, Citi manages\nthese activities by taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor. Citi\nmanages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions\nby conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in\ncapacity, tenors, haircut, collateral profile and client\nactions. In addition, Citi maintains counterparty\ndiversification by establishing concentration triggers and\nassessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress.\n\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary,\n\nrequire prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to\nmaintain contractual margin protection. For resale and\nrepurchase agreements, when necessary, the Company posts\nadditional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin\nprotection. Collateral typically consists of government and\ngovernment-agency securities, corporate and municipal bonds,\nequities and mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. The\nresale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother type of default under the relevant master agreement.\nEvents of default generally include (i) failure to deliver cash\nor securities as required under the transaction, (ii) failure to\nprovide or return cash or securities as used for margining\npurposes, (iii) breach of representation, (iv) cross-default to\nanother transaction entered into among the parties, or, in some\ncases, their affiliates and (v) a repudiation of obligations\nunder the agreement. The counterparty that receives the\nsecurities in these transactions is generally unrestricted in\nits use of the securities, with the exception of transactions\nexecuted on a tri-party basis, where the collateral is\nmaintained by a custodian and operational limitations may\nrestrict its use of the securities. A substantial portion of the\nresale and repurchase agreements is recorded at fair value as\nthe Company elected the fair value option, as described in Notes\n25 and 26. The remaining portion is carried at the amount of\ncash initially advanced or received, plus accrued interest, as\nspecified in the respective agreements. The securities borrowing\nand lending agreements also represent collateralized financing\ntransactions similar to the resale and repurchase agreements.\nCollateral typically consists of government and government-\nagency securities and corporate debt and equity securities.\nSimilar to the resale and repurchase agreements, securities\nborrowing and lending agreements are generally documented under\nindustry standard agreements that allow the prompt close-out of\nall transactions (including the liquidation of securities held)\nand the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities\nby the non-defaulting party, following a payment default or\nother default by the other party under the relevant master\nagreement. Events of default and rights to use securities under\nthe securities borrowing and lending agreements are similar to\nthe resale and repurchase agreements referenced above. A\nsubstantial portion of securities borrowing and lending\nagreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 26. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection.\n                              189                               \nThe enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the\nmaster netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements,\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements, is evidenced to\nthe extent that (i) a supportive legal opinion has been obtained\nfrom counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding the enforceability of these\nagreements and (ii) the exercise of rights by the non-defaulting\nparty to terminate and close out transactions on a net basis\nunder these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under\napplicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or similar proceeding. A legal opinion may not have\nbeen sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local\nlaw is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the\nenforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or\nconflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of\nsuch rights. In some jurisdictions and for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may\nbe nonexistent or unclear as overlapping regimes may exist. For\nexample, this may be the case for certain sovereigns,\nmunicipalities, central banks and U.S. pension plans. The\nfollowing tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements and\nthe related offsetting amounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45.\nThe tables also include amounts related to financial instruments\nthat are not permitted to be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but\nwould be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a legal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained.\nRemaining exposures continue to be secured by financial\ncollateral, but the Company may not have sought or been able to\nobtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of the\noffsetting right.\n                                                                \n

BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND\nBROKERAGE PAYABLES\n\nThe Company has receivables\nand payables for financial\ninstruments sold to and\npurchased from brokers,\ndealers and customers, which\narise in the ordinary course\nof business. Citi is exposed\nto risk of loss from the\ninability of brokers, dealers\nor customers to pay for\npurchases or to deliver the\nfinancial instruments sold, in\nwhich case Citi would have to\nsell or purchase the financial\ninstruments at prevailing\nmarket prices. Credit risk is\nreduced to the extent that an\nexchange or clearing\norganization acts as a\ncounterparty to the\ntransaction and replaces the\nbroker, dealer or customer in\nquestion.\n\nCiti seeks to protect itself\nfrom the risks associated with\ncustomer activities by\nrequiring customers to\nmaintain margin collateral in\ncompliance with regulatory and\ninternal guidelines. Margin\nlevels are monitored daily,\nand customers deposit\nadditional collateral as\nrequired.

The loss amounts will remain in\nAOCI and will be amortized over the remaining life of the\nsecurities and bonds.\nAt December 31, 2022, the amortized cost of AFS fixed income\nsecurities for those in a loss position exceeded their fair\nvalue by $ 6,604million. Of the $ 6,604million, $ 3,997million\nrepresented unrealized losses on fixed income investments that\nhave been in a gross unrealized loss position for less than a\nyear and, of these, 73% were rated investment grade; and $\n2,607million represented unrealized losses on fixed income\ninvestments that have been in a gross unrealized loss position\nfor a year or more and, of these, 99% were rated investment\ngrade.

At the time of transfer, the securities\nand bonds were in an unrealized loss position of $ 2.3billion\nand $ 12million, respectively. The loss amounts will remain in\nAOCI and will be amortized over the remaining life of the\nsecurities and bonds.\nThe Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these\nsecurities to maturity or, where applicable, until the exercise\nof any issuer call option, absent any unforeseen significant\nchanges in circumstances, including deterioration in credit or\nchanges in regulatory capital requirements. The net unrealized\nlosses classified in AOCI for HTM debt securities primarily\nrelate to debt securities previously classified as AFS that were\ntransferred to HTM, and include any cumulative fair value hedge\nadjustments. The net unrealized loss amount also includes any\nnon-credit-related changes in fair value of HTM debt securities\nthat have suffered credit impairment recorded in earnings. The\nAOCI balance related to HTM debt securities is amortized as an\nadjustment of yield, in a manner consistent with the accretion\nof any difference between the carrying value at the transfer\ndate

An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under business policies. The sections\nbelow describe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected\ncredit impairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of December 31, 2022. Agency\nMortgage-Backed Securities Citi records no allowances for credit\nlosses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities, because the Company expects to incur no credit\nlosses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no\ncredit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties. State\nand Municipal Securities The process for estimating credit\nlosses in Citigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily\nbased on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit\nratings. Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers\nproviding default protection in the form of financial guarantee\ninsurance. The average external credit rating, disregarding any\ninsurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating\ndowngrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based\non instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of\nissuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for\nadverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of\nvalue, the full impairment is recognized in earnings. For AFS\nstate and municipal bonds where Citi has no intent to sell and\nit is not more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required\nto sell, Citi records an allowance for expected credit losses\nfor the amount it expects not to collect, capped at the\ndifference between the bond\u2019s amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue. Equity Method Investments Management assesses equity\nmethod investments that have fair values that are less than\ntheir respective carrying values for other-than-temporary\nimpairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured as price multiplied by\nquantity if the investee has publicly listed securities. If the\ninvestee is not publicly listed, other methods are used (see\nNote 25). For impaired equity method investments that Citi plans\nto sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-than-not\nbe required to sell, with no expectation that the fair value\nwill recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether\nthe impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the cause of the impairment and the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,\nincluding any specific events that may influence the operations\nof the issuer; \u2022 the intent and ability to hold the investment\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in market value; and \u2022 the length of time and extent to\nwhich fair value has been less than the carrying value.\n                              200

Lease financing Citi is a lessor in the power, railcars,\nshipping and aircraft sectors, where the Company has executed\noperating, direct financing and leveraged leases. Citi\u2019s $\n0.4billion of lease financing receivables, as of December 31,\n2022, is composed of approximately equal balances of direct\nfinancing lease receivables and net investments in leveraged\nleases. Citi uses the interest rate implicit in the lease to\ndetermine the present value of its lease financing receivables.\nInterest income on direct financing and leveraged leases during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 was not material. The Company\u2019s\noperating leases, where Citi is a lessor, are not significant to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements. Delinquency Status Citi\ngenerally does not manage corporate loans on a delinquency\nbasis. Corporate loans are placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis\nwhen it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-\nlooking assessment of the collectability of the loan in full,\nthat the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when\ninterest or principal is 90days past due, except when the loan\nis well collateralized and in the process of collection. Any\ninterest accrued on impaired corporate loans and leases is\nreversed at 90days and charged against current earnings, and\ninterest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent\nactually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectibility of principal, all cash receipts are\nthereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the\nloan. While corporate loans are generally managed based on their\ninternally assigned risk rating (see further discussion below),\nthe following tables present delinquency information by\ncorporate loan type.\n                              204                               \nCorporate Loan Delinquencies and Non-Accrual Details at December\n31, 2022\n

that are 90days past due are generally\nclassified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past\ndue when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are\n90days or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest and/or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30days past due are presented as current.\n(4) The Total loans column includes loans at fair value, which\nare not included in the various delinquency columns, and\ntherefore the tables\u2019 total rows will not cross-foot.\n\nCitigroup has a risk management process to monitor, evaluate and\nmanage the principal risks associated with its corporate loan\nportfolio. As part of its risk management process, Citi assigns\nnumeric risk ratings to its corporate loan facilities based on\nquantitative and qualitative assessments of the obligor and\nfacility. These risk ratings are reviewed at least annually or\nmore often if material events related to the obligor or facility\nwarrant. Factors considered in assigning the risk ratings\ninclude financial condition of the obligor, qualitative\nassessment of management and strategy, amount and sources of\nrepayment, amount and type of collateral and guarantee\narrangements, amount and type of any contingencies associated\nwith the obligor and the obligor\u2019s industry and geography. The\nobligor risk ratings are defined by ranges of default\nprobabilities. The facility risk ratings are defined by ranges\nof loss norms, which are the product of the probability of\ndefault and the loss given default. The investment-grade rating\ncategories are similar to the category BBB-/Baa3 and above as\ndefined by S&P and Moody\u2019s. Loans classified according to the\nbank regulatory definitions as special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful and loss will have risk ratings within the non-\ninvestment-grade categories.\n

final principal payments. Because forgiveness of\nprincipal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically\nhave little to no impact on the loans\u2019 projected cash flows and\nthus little to no impact on the allowance established for the\nloans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be\nrecorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already\nbeen recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is\nrequired at the time of the modification.\n(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest\npayments may involve a below-market interest rate.\nThe following table presents total corporate loans modified in a\nTDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the\npayment default occurred within one yearof a permanent\nmodification. Default is defined as 60days past due, except for\nclassifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is\ndefined as 90days past due.\n                                                                \n                             TDR                        TDR     \n                             loans                      loans   \n                             that                       that    \n                             re-de\u2026                     re-de\u2026  \n                             in                         in      \n                   TDR       2022             TDR       2020    \n               balanc\u2026       within       balanc\u2026       within  \n  In\u00a0               at       one               at       one     \n  milli\u2026       Decemb\u2026       year         Decemb\u2026       year    \n  of\u00a0              31,       of               31,       of      \n  dolla\u2026          2022       modif\u2026          2021       modif\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and       $       85    $  \u2014         $      236    $  \u2014       \n  indus\u2026                                                        \n  Mortg\u2026                                                        \n  and               13       \u2014                 20       \u2014       \n  real                                                          \n  estate                                                        \n  Other             12       \u2014                 28       \u2014       \n  Total\u2026    $      110    $  \u2014         $      284    $  \u2014       \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding that\nwere considered TDRs as of the end of the reporting period.\n                              209                               \nConsumer Loans Consumer loans represent loans and leases managed\nprimarily by PBWM and Legacy Franchises (except Mexico SBMM) .\nCitigroup has established a risk management process to monitor,\nevaluate and manage the principal risks associated with its\nconsumer loan portfolio. Credit quality indicators that are\nactively monitored include delinquency status, consumer credit\nscores under Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) and loan to value\n(LTV) ratios, each as discussed in more detail below.\nDelinquency Status Delinquency status is monitored and\nconsidered a key indicator of credit quality of consumer loans.\nPrincipally, the U.S. residential first mortgage loans use the\nMortgage Bankers Association (MBA) method of reporting\ndelinquencies, which considers a loan delinquent if a monthly\npayment has not been received by the end of the day immediately\npreceding the loan\u2019s next due date. All other loans use a method\nof reporting delinquencies that considers a loan delinquent if a\nmonthly payment has not been received by the close of business\non the loan\u2019s next due date. As a general policy, residential\nfirst mortgages, home equity loans and installment loans are\nclassified as non-accrual when loan payments are 90days\ncontractually past due. Credit cards and unsecured revolving\nloans generally accrue interest until payments are 180days past\ndue. Home equity loans in regulated bank entities are classified\nas non-accrual if the related residential first mortgage is\n90days or more past due. Mortgage loans, other than Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA)-insured loans, are classified as\nnon-accrual within 60days of notification that the borrower has\nfiled for bankruptcy. The policy for re-aging modified U.S.\nconsumer loans to current status varies by product. Generally,\none of the conditions to qualify for these modifications is that\na minimum number of payments (typically ranging from oneto\nthree) be made. Upon modification, the loan is re-aged to\ncurrent status. However, re-aging practices for certain open-\nended consumer loans, such as credit cards, are governed by\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)\nguidelines. For open-ended consumer loans subject to FFIEC\nguidelines, one of the conditions for a loan to be re-aged to\ncurrent status is that at least threeconsecutive minimum monthly\npayments, or the equivalent amount, must be received. In\naddition, under FFIEC guidelines, the number of times that such\na loan can be re-aged is subject to limitations (generally once\nin 12 months and twice in five years). Furthermore, FHA and\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans are modified under\nthose respective agencies\u2019 guidelines and payments are not\nalways required in order to re-age a modified loan to current.\nThe tables below present details about these loans, including\nthe following loan categories: \u2022 Residential first mortgages and\nHome equity loans in North America offices primarily represent\nsecured mortgage lending to customers of Retail banking and\nGlobal Wealth (primarily Private bank and Citigold). \u2022 Credit\ncards in North America offices primarily represent unsecured\ncredit card lending to customers of Branded cards and Retail\nservices. \u2022 Personal, small business and other loans in North\nAmerica are primarily composed of classifiably managed loans to\ncustomers of Global Wealth (mostly within the Private bank) who\nare typically high credit quality borrowers that historically\nexperienced minimal delinquencies and credit losses. Loans to\nthese borrowers are generally well collateralized in the form of\nliquid securities and other forms of collateral. \u2022 Residential\nmortgage loans in offices outside North America primarily\nrepresent secured mortgage lending to customers of Global Wealth\n(primarily Private bank and Citigold) as well as customers of\nLegacy Franchises . \u2022 Credit cards in offices outside North\nAmerica primarily represent unsecured credit card lending to\ncustomers of Legacy Franchises , primarily in Asia and Mexico. \u2022\nPersonal, small business and other loans in offices outside\nNorth America are primarily composed of secured and unsecured\nloans to customers of PBWM and Legacy Franchises . A significant\nportion of PBWM loans is classifiably managed and represents\nloans to high credit quality Private bank customers who\nhistorically experienced minimal delinquencies and credit\nlosses.

The classifiably managed\nportion of these loans is shown as \u201ccurrent\u201d because the\ndelinquency status is not applicable, since these loans are\nprimarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk\nclassification.\n\nInterest Income Recognized for Non-Accrual Consumer Loans\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                       For the years ended             \n  In North America                     December 31,             \n  offices(1)                                   2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Residential first        $                     12    $    13  \n  mortgages                                                     \n  Home equity loans                               5          7  \n  Credit cards                                    \u2014          \u2014  \n  Personal, small                                 2          \u2014  \n  business and other                                            \n  Total                    $                     19    $    20  \n  In offices outside                                            \n  North America(1)                                              \n  Residential mortgages    $                      4    $     1  \n  Credit cards                                    \u2014          \u2014  \n  Personal, small                                 4          \u2014  \n  business and other                                            \n  Total                    $                      8    $     1  \n  Total Citigroup          $                     27    $    21  \n                                                                \n(1) North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico.\nMexico is included in offices outside North America.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company\nsold and/or reclassified to HFS $ 582million and $ 1,473million\nof consumer loans, respectively.

These scores are\ncontinually updated by the agencies based upon an individual\u2019s\ncredit actions (e.g., taking out a loan or missed or late\npayments). The following tables provide details on the FICO\nscores for Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-\nperiod receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are\nupdated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or,\notherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio. For\nCiti\u2019s $ 80.5billion and $ 114.3billion in the consumer loan\nportfolio outside of the U.S. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, various country-specific or regional credit risk\nmetrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are\nleveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality\nof customers (for additional information on loans outside of the\nU.S., see \u201cConsumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North America\u201d\nbelow). As a result, details of relevant credit quality\nindicators for those loans are not comparable to the below FICO\nscore distribution for the U.S. portfolio.\n

See Note\n2.\n(2) Goodwill impairment of $ 535million (approximately $\n489million after-tax) was incurred in the Asia Consumer\nreporting unit of Legacy Franchises in the first quarter of\n2022, due to the re-segmentation and change of reporting units\nas well as the sequence of the signing of sale agreements.\nAs discussed in Note 3, effective January 1, 2022, as part of\nits strategic refresh, Citi made changes to its management\nstructure, which resulted in changes in its operating segments\nand reporting units to reflect how the CEO, who is the chief\noperating decision maker, manages the Company, including\nallocating resources and measuring performance. Goodwill\nbalances were reallocated across the new reporting units based\non their relative fair values using the valuation performed as\nof the effective date of the reorganization. Further, the\ngoodwill balances associated with certain Asia Consumer\nbusinesses within the Legacy Franchises operating segment were\nreclassified to HFS as of March 31, 2022 upon the signing of the\nrespective sale agreements. See Note 2 for a discussion of\nCiti\u2019s divestiture activities. The reorganization of Citi\u2019s\nreporting structure and the announced sales of businesses within\na reporting unit were identified as triggering events for\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing. Consistent with the\nrequirements of ASC 350, interim goodwill impairment tests were\nperformed that resulted in an impairment of $ 535million to the\nAsia Consumer reporting unit within the Legacy Franchises\noperating segment, due to the implementation of Citi\u2019s revised\noperating segments and reporting units, as well as the timing of\nmutual execution of sale agreements for Asia consumer banking\nbusinesses. This impairment was recorded in the first quarter of\n2022 as an operating expense. There were no additional\nimpairment charges incurred as a result of any of the other\ninterim goodwill impairment tests performed during 2022. For the\ninterim impairment tests performed in the first quarter of 2022,\nthe valuation of reporting units used either the market\napproach, income approach, or a combination of both. Under the\nmarket approach, Citi estimated fair value by comparing the\nbusiness to similar businesses or guideline companies whose\nsecurities are actively traded in public markets. Under the\nincome approach, Citi used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model in\nwhich cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a\nterminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted\nto their present value using an appropriate rate that is\ncommensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit.\nThe key assumptions used to determine the fair value of Citi\u2019s\nreporting units consisted primarily of significant unobservable\ninputs (Level 3 fair value inputs), including discount rates,\nestimated cash flows, growth rates, earnings multiples and/or\ntransaction multiples of similar businesses or guideline public\ncompanies, and bids from buyers. The DCF method employs a\ncapital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate\nbased on several factors, including market interest rates, and\nincludes adjustments for market risk and company-specific risk.\nEstimated cash flows are based on internally developed estimates\nand the growth rates are based on industry knowledge and\nhistorical performance. Citi had historically performed its\nannual goodwill impairment test as of July 1 each year. During\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company voluntarily\nchanged its annual impairment assessment date from July 1 to\nOctober 1. Based on interim impairment tests performed within\nthe period between the previous annual test on July 1, 2021 and\nthe annual test to be performed on October 1, 2022, no more than\n12 months have elapsed between goodwill impairment tests of any\nof Citi\u2019s reporting units. The change in measurement date\nrepresents a change in method of applying an accounting\nprinciple. This change is preferable because it better aligns\nthe Company\u2019s goodwill impairment testing procedures with its\nannual planning process and with its fiscal year-end. Citi\ncontinues to monitor each reporting unit for triggering events\nfor purposes of goodwill impairment testing.\n                              226                               \nThe change in accounting\nprinciple did not result in\nany delay, acceleration or\navoidance of an impairment\ncharge. Citi performed its\nannual goodwill impairment\ntest as of October 1, 2022,\nwhich resulted in no\nimpairment of any of Citi\u2019s\nreporting units. While the\ninherent risk of uncertainty\nis embedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, the economic and\nbusiness environments continue\nto evolve as management\nimplements its strategic\nrefresh. If management\u2019s\nfuture estimate of key\neconomic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom its current assumptions,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture.

SECURITIZATIONS AND\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n\nUses of Special Purpose\nEntities A special purpose\nentity (SPE) is an entity\ndesigned to fulfill a specific\nlimited need of the company\nthat organized it. The\nprincipal uses of SPEs by Citi\nare to assist clients in\nsecuritizing their financial\nassets and create investment\nproducts for clients and to\nobtain liquidity and optimize\ncapital efficiency by\nsecuritizing certain of Citi\u2019s\nfinancial assets. SPEs may be\norganized in various legal\nforms, including trusts,\npartnerships or corporations.\nIn a securitization, through\nthe SPE\u2019s issuance of debt and\nequity instruments,\ncertificates, commercial paper\nor other notes of\nindebtedness, the company\ntransferring assets to the SPE\nconverts all (or a portion) of\nthose assets into cash before\nthey would have been realized\nin the normal course of\nbusiness. These issuances are\nrecorded on the balance sheet\nof the SPE, which may or may\nnot be consolidated onto the\nbalance sheet of the company\nthat organized the SPE.\nInvestors usually have\nrecourse only to the assets in\nthe SPE, but may also benefit\nfrom other credit\nenhancements, such as a\ncollateral account, a line of\ncredit or a liquidity\nfacility, such as a liquidity\nput option or asset purchase\nagreement. Because of these\nenhancements, the SPE\nissuances typically obtain a\nmore favorable credit rating\nthan the transferor could\nobtain for its own debt\nissuances. This results in\nless expensive financing costs\nthan unsecured debt. The SPE\nmay also enter into derivative\ncontracts in order to convert\nthe yield or currency of the\nunderlying assets to match the\nneeds of the SPE investors or\nto limit or change the credit\nrisk of the SPE. Citigroup may\nbe the provider of certain\ncredit enhancements as well as\nthe counterparty to any\nrelated derivative contracts.\nMost of Citigroup\u2019s SPEs are\nvariable interest entities\n(VIEs).\n\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are described in Note 1.\nInvestors that finance the VIE\nthrough debt or equity\ninterests or other\ncounterparties providing other\nforms of support, such as\nguarantees, certain fee\narrangements or certain types\nof derivative contracts, are\nvariable interest holders in\nthe entity. The variable\ninterest holder, if any, that\nhas a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is deemed to\nbe the primary beneficiary and\nmust consolidate the VIE. The\nCompany must evaluate each VIE\nto understand the purpose and\ndesign of the entity, the role\nthe Company had in the\nentity\u2019s design and its\ninvolvement in the VIE\u2019s\nongoing activities. The\nCompany then must evaluate\nwhich activities most\nsignificantly impact the\neconomic performance of the\nVIE and who has the power to\ndirect such activities. For\nthose VIEs where the Company\ndetermines that it has the\npower to direct the activities\nthat most significantly impact\nthe VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance, the Company must\nthen evaluate its economic\ninterests, if any, and\ndetermine whether it could\nabsorb losses or receive\nbenefits that could\npotentially be significant to\nthe VIE. When evaluating\nwhether the Company has an\nobligation to absorb losses\nthat could potentially be\nsignificant, it considers the\nmaximum exposure to such loss\nwithout consideration of\nprobability. Such obligations\ncould be in various forms,\nincluding, but not limited to,\ndebt and equity investments,\nguarantees, liquidity\nagreements and certain\nderivative contracts. In\nvarious other transactions,\nthe Company may (i) act as a\nderivative counterparty (e.g.,\ninterest rate swap, cross-\ncurrency swap or purchaser of\ncredit protection under a\ncredit default swap or total\nreturn swap where the Company\npays the total return on\ncertain assets to the SPE),\n(ii) act as underwriter or\nplacement agent, (iii) provide\nadministrative, trustee or\nother services or (iv) make a\nmarket in debt securities or\nother instruments issued by\nVIEs. The Company generally\nconsiders such involvement, by\nitself, not to be variable\ninterests and thus not an\nindicator of power or\npotentially significant\nbenefits or losses.\n

significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 69billion and $\n100billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 498million and $\n497million in maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\n                              238                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain investment funds\nfor which the Company provides investment management services\nand personal estate trusts for which the Company provides\nadministrative, trustee and/or investment management services; \u2022\ncertain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the\nCompany provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no\ndecision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some\nof which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-\nrelated commitment. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions\nwas $ 33.6billion and $ 55.6billion, respectively (see Notes 14\nand 26 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain VIEs\nstructured by third parties in which the Company holds\nsecurities in inventory, as these investments are made on\narm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities held by the Company, which are classified as\nTrading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has\nno other involvement with the related securitization entity\ndeemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and 25 for more\ninformation on these positions); \u2022 certain representations and\nwarranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage\nsecuritizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances\nare no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs such as preferred\nsecurities trusts used in connection with the Company\u2019s funding\nactivities. The Company does not have a variable interest in\nthese trusts. The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent\nthe carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company.\nThe carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the\ncurrent fair value of the assets depending on the classification\nof the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated\naccounting model ascribed to that classification. The asset\nbalances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has\nsignificant involvement represent the most current information\navailable to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances\nrepresent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments,\nunless fair value information is readily available to the\nCompany. The maximum funded exposure represents the balance\nsheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in the VIE. It\nreflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE,\nadjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments\nreceived. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases\nor declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized\nin earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions\nrepresents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including\nliquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the\nnotional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a\nvariable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has\nentered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that\nare not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest\nrate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the\npurchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or\ntotal return swap where the Company pays the total return on\ncertain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements\nare not included in the maximum exposure amounts.\n                              239                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets in the\ntable below include those assets that can only be used to settle\nobligations of consolidated VIEs, presented on the following\npage, and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the\nassets in the table below include third-party assets of\nconsolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that\neliminate in consolidation. The liabilities in the table below\ninclude third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs only and\nexclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\nThe liabilities also exclude amounts where creditors or\nbeneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit\nof Citigroup.\n                                                                \n  In millions of dollars

securitizations that do not qualify\nfor sales treatment; thus, the assets remain on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are\nrecognized as secured liabilities. In general, the third-party\ninvestors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal\nrecourse only to the assets of the respective VIEs and do not\nhave such recourse to the Company, except where Citi has\nprovided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to\ncertain derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus,\nCitigroup\u2019s maximum legal exposure to loss related to\nconsolidated VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value\nof the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding third-party\nfinancing. Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted\nfrom being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from\nthese assets are the only source used to pay down the associated\nliabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi\u2019s general assets.\nSee the Consolidated Balance Sheet for more information about\nthese Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.\n\nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of           December 31,           December 31,  \n  dollars                          2022                   2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash               $                \u2014    $                 \u2014  \n  Trading account                   1.6                    1.4  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                       8.6                    8.8  \n  Total loans,                                                  \n  net of                           44.2                   35.4  \n  allowance                                                     \n  Other                             0.6                    0.8  \n  Total assets       $             55.0    $              46.4  \n                                                                \n                              241                               \nCredit Card Securitizations The Company securitizes credit card\nreceivables through trusts established to purchase the\nreceivables. Citigroup transfers receivables into the trusts on\na non-recourse basis. Credit card securitizations are revolving\nsecuritizations: as customers pay their credit card balances,\nthe cash proceeds are used to purchase new receivables and\nreplenish the receivables in the trust. Substantially all of the\nCompany\u2019s credit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial majority\nthrough the Master Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities\nbecause, as servicer, Citigroup has the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts. Citigroup holds a seller\u2019s interest\nand certain securities issued by the trusts, which could result\nin exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from\nthe trusts. Accordingly, the transferred credit card receivables\nremain on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet with nogain or loss\nrecognized.

Once\noriginated, the Company often securitizes these loans through\nthe use of VIEs. These VIEs are funded through the issuance of\ntrust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets.\nThese certificates have the same life as the transferred assets.\nIn addition to providing a source of liquidity and less\nexpensive funding, securitizing these assets also reduces Citi\u2019s\ncredit exposure to the borrowers. These mortgage loan\nsecuritizations are primarily non-recourse, thereby effectively\ntransferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers\nof the securities issued by the trust. Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer\nmortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in\ncertain instances retains investment securities, interest-only\nstrips and residual interests in future cash flows from the\ntrusts and also provides servicing for a limited number of ICG\nsecuritizations. Citi\u2019s ICG business may hold investment\nsecurities pursuant to credit risk retention rules or in\nconnection with secondary market-making activities. The Company\nsecuritizes mortgage loans generally through either a U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored agency, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or\nFreddie Mac (U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages), or private label\n(non-agency-sponsored mortgages) securitization. Citi is not the\nprimary beneficiary of its U.S. agency-sponsored mortgage\nsecuritization entities because Citigroup does not have the\npower to direct the activities of the VIEs that most\nsignificantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance.\nTherefore, Citi does not consolidate these U.S. agency-sponsored\nmortgage securitization entities. Substantially all of the\nconsumer loans sold or securitized through non-consolidated\ntrusts by Citigroup are U.S. prime residential mortgage loans.\nRetained interests in non-consolidated agency-sponsored mortgage\nsecuritization trusts are classified as Trading account assets ,\nexcept for MSRs, which are included in Other assets on\nCitigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Citigroup does not\nconsolidate certain non-agency-sponsored mortgage securitization\nentities because Citi is either not the servicer with the power\nto direct the significant activities of the entity or Citi is\nthe servicer, but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a\nfiduciary relationship; therefore, Citi is not deemed to be the\nprimary beneficiary of the entity. In certain instances, the\nCompany has (i) the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the entities\u2019 economic performance and (ii)\nthe obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive\nbenefits that could be potentially significant to its non-\nagency-sponsored mortgage securitization entities and,\ntherefore, is the primary beneficiary and, thus, consolidates\nthe VIE.\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information\nand retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage\nsecuritizations:\n                                                                \n          2\u2026                20\u2026                20\u2026              \n  \u2026       U\u2026                U.\u2026                U.\u2026              \n  \u2026       a\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026       ag\u2026       N\u2026     \n  \u2026       s\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026       sp\u2026       s\u2026     \n  \u2026       m\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026       mo\u2026       m\u2026     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026    $  6\u2026    $  1\u2026    $  6.1    $  2\u2026    $  9.4    $  1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       6\u2026       1\u2026       6.4       2\u2026       10\u2026       1\u2026     \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       0.1        \u2014       0.1           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026        \u2014       0\u2026         \u2014       0\u2026         \u2014           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026       0\u2026        \u2014       0.2        \u2014       0.4           \u2014  \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n  \u2026                                                             \n                                                                \nNote: Excludes re-securitization transactions.\nFor non-consolidated mortgage securitization entities where the\ntransfer of loans to the VIE meets the conditions for sale\naccounting, Citi recognizes a gain or loss based on the\ndifference between the carrying value of the transferred assets\nand the proceeds received (generally cash but may be beneficial\ninterests or servicing rights).

the\nsecuritization of mortgage\nloans, Citi\u2019s U.S. consumer\nmortgage business generally\nretains the servicing rights,\nwhich entitle the Company to a\nfuture stream of cash flows\nbased on the outstanding\nprincipal balances of the\nloans and the contractual\nservicing fee. Failure to\nservice the loans in\naccordance with contractual\nrequirements may lead to a\ntermination of the servicing\nrights and the loss of future\nservicing fees. These\ntransactions create intangible\nassets referred to as MSRs,\nwhich are recorded at fair\nvalue on Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The fair value\nof Citi\u2019s capitalized MSRs was\n$ 665million and $ 404million\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The MSRs\ncorrespond to principal loan\nbalances of $ 51billion and $\n47billion as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in capitalized MSRs:\n                                                              \n  In millions of dollars                     2022       2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Balance, beginning of year              $   404    $   336  \n  Originations                                120         92  \n  Changes in fair value of MSRs due to        201         43  \n  changes in inputs and assumptions                           \n  Other changes(1)                            -60        -67  \n  Sales of MSRs                                 \u2014          \u2014  \n  Balance, as of December 31              $   665    $   404  \n                                                              \n(1) Represents changes due to customer payments and passage of\ntime.\nThe fair value of the MSRs is\nprimarily affected by changes\nin prepayments of mortgages\nthat result from shifts in\nmortgage interest rates.\nSpecifically, higher interest\nrates tend to lead to\ndeclining prepayments, which\ncauses the fair value of the\nMSRs to increase.

As of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, Citi held no\nretained interests in private\nlabel re-securitization\ntransactions structured by\nCiti. The Company also re-\nsecuritizes U.S. government-\nagency-guaranteed mortgage-\nbacked (agency) securities.\nDuring the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021,\nCiti transferred agency\nsecurities with a fair value\nof approximately $ 24.1billion\nand $ 46.6billion,\nrespectively, to re-\nsecuritization entities. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the fair\nvalue of Citi-retained\ninterests in agency re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.4billion\n(including $ 802million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2022)\ncompared to $ 1.2billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 (including $\n641million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2021), which is\nrecorded in Trading account\nassets . The original fair\nvalues of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021 were\napproximately $ 79.4billion\nand $ 78.4billion,\nrespectively. As of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, the Company\ndid not consolidate any\nprivate label or agency re-\nsecuritization entities. Citi-\nAdministered Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Conduits The\nCompany is active in the\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduit business as\nadministrator of several\nmulti-seller commercial paper\nconduits and also as a service\nprovider to single-seller and\nother commercial paper\nconduits sponsored by third\nparties. Citi\u2019s multi-seller\ncommercial paper conduits are\ndesigned to provide the\nCompany\u2019s clients access to\nlow-cost funding in the\ncommercial paper markets. The\nconduits purchase assets from\nor provide financing\nfacilities to clients and are\nfunded by issuing commercial\npaper to third-party\ninvestors. The conduits\ngenerally do not purchase\nassets originated by Citi. The\nfunding of the conduits is\nfacilitated by the liquidity\nsupport and credit\nenhancements provided by the\nCompany. As administrator to\nCiti\u2019s conduits, the Company\nis generally responsible for\nselecting and structuring\nassets purchased or financed\nby the conduits, making\ndecisions regarding the\nfunding of the conduits,\nincluding determining the\ntenor and other features of\nthe commercial paper issued,\nmonitoring the quality and\nperformance of the conduits\u2019\nassets and facilitating the\noperations and cash flows of\nthe conduits. In return, the\nCompany earns structuring fees\nfrom customers for individual\ntransactions and earns an\nadministration fee from the\nconduit, which is equal to the\nincome from the client program\nand liquidity fees of the\nconduit after payment of\nconduit expenses. This\nadministration fee is fairly\nstable, since most risks and\nrewards of the underlying\nassets are passed back to the\nclients. Once the asset\npricing is negotiated, most\nongoing income, costs and fees\nare relatively stable as a\npercentage of the conduit\u2019s\nsize. The conduits\nadministered by Citi do not\ngenerally invest in liquid\nsecurities that are formally\nrated by third parties. The\n                              246                               \nassets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that\nare generally designed to be held by the conduit, rather than\nactively traded and sold. The yield earned by the conduit on\neach asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper\nissued by the conduit, thus passing interest rate risk to the\nclient. Each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with\ntransaction-specific credit enhancement features provided by the\nthird-party client seller, including over-collateralization,\ncash and excess spread collateral accounts, direct recourse or\nthird-party guarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with\nthe objective of approximating a credit rating of A or above,\nbased on Citi\u2019s internal risk ratings. At December 31, 2022 and\n2021, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had\napproximately $ 19.6billion and $ 14billion of purchased assets\noutstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding\ncommitments with clients of approximately $ 13.9billion and $\n18.3billion, respectively. Substantially all of the funding of\nthe conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the weighted average remaining lives\nof the commercial paper issued by the conduits were\napproximately 64and 70days, respectively. The primary credit\nenhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of\ntransaction-specific credit enhancements described above. Each\nasset purchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-\nspecific credit enhancement features provided by the third-party\nclient seller, including over-collateralization, cash and excess\nspread collateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party\nguarantees. These credit enhancements are sized with the\nobjective of approximating a credit rating of A or above, based\non Citi\u2019s internal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements, the conduits, other than the\ngovernment-guaranteed loan conduit, have obtained letters of\ncredit from the Company, which equal at least 8% to 10% of the\nconduit\u2019s assets with a minimum of $ 200million. The letters of\ncredit provided by the Company to the conduits total\napproximately $ 1.9billion as of December 31, 2022 and $\n1.3billion as of December 31, 2021. The net result across\nmultiseller conduits administered by the Company is that, in the\nevent that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements described above, any losses in each conduit\nare allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial\npaper investors. Citigroup also provides the conduits with two\nforms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding\nto the conduits in the event of a market disruption, among other\nevents. Each asset of the conduits is supported by a\ntransaction-specific liquidity facility in the form of an asset\npurchase agreement (APA). Under the APA, the Company has\ngenerally agreed to purchase non-defaulted eligible receivables\nfrom the conduit at par. The APA is not designed to provide\ncredit support to the conduit, as it generally does not permit\nthe purchase of defaulted or impaired assets. Any funding under\nthe APA will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to\nincreased interest costs. In addition, the Company provides the\nconduits with program-wide liquidity in the form of short-term\nlending commitments. Under these commitments, the Company has\nagreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a short-term\ndisruption in the commercial paper market, subject to specified\nconditions. The Company receives fees for providing both types\nof liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair\nmarket terms. Finally, Citi is one of several named dealers in\nthe commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market-\nbased fee for providing such services. Along with third-party\ndealers, the Company makes a market in the commercial paper and\nmay from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a\nthird party. On specific dates with less liquidity in the\nmarket, the Company may hold in inventory commercial paper\nissued by conduits administered by the Company, as well as\nconduits administered by third parties. Separately, in the\nnormal course of business, Citi purchases commercial paper,\nincluding commercial paper issued by Citigroup's conduits. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company owned $ 8.6billion and $\n4.9billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits. The Company\u2019s investments were not driven\nby market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any\nagreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the\nconduits. The asset-backed commercial paper conduits are\nconsolidated by Citi. The Company has determined that, through\nits roles as administrator and liquidity provider, it has the\npower to direct the activities that most significantly impact\nthe entities\u2019 economic performance. These powers include its\nability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the\nconduits, its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation\nactivities, its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the\nconduits and its liability management. In addition, as a result\nof all the Company\u2019s involvement described above, it was\nconcluded that Citi has an economic interest that could\npotentially be significant. However, the assets and liabilities\nof the conduits are separate and apart from those of Citigroup.\nNo assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors\nof Citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries. Collateralized\nLoan Obligations (CLOs) A collateralized loan obligation (CLO)\nis a VIE that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting\nprimarily of non-investment grade corporate loans. CLOs issue\nmultiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the\nasset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming\nthe CLO. A third-party asset manager is contracted by the CLO to\npurchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor\nthe credit risk associated with those assets. Over the term of a\nCLO, the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in\na manner consistent with the CLO\u2019s asset management agreement\nand indenture. In general, the CLO asset manager will have the\npower to direct the activities of the entity that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of the CLO.\nInvestors in a CLO, through their ownership of debt and/or\nequity in it, can also direct certain activities of the CLO,\nincluding removing its asset manager under limited\ncircumstances, optionally redeeming the notes, voting on\namendments to the CLO\u2019s operating documents and other\nactivities. A CLO has a finite life, typically 12years. Citi\nserves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the\nCLOs. Typically, the debt and equity of the CLOs are sold to\nthird-party investors. On occasion, certain Citi entities may\npurchase some portion of a CLO\u2019s liabilities\n                              247                               \nfor investment purposes. In\naddition, Citi may purchase,\ntypically in the secondary\nmarket, certain securities\nissued by the CLOs to support\nits market-making activities.\nThe Company generally does not\nhave the power to direct the\nactivities that most\nsignificantly impact the\neconomic performance of the\nCLOs, as this power is\ngenerally held by a third-\nparty asset manager of the\nCLO. As such, those CLOs are\nnot consolidated.\nThe following tables summarize selected cash flow information\nand retained interests related to Citigroup CLOs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of dollars            2022       2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Principal securitized          $     \u2014    $     \u2014    $   0.1  \n  Proceeds from new                    \u2014          \u2014        0.1  \n  securitizations                                               \n  Cash flows received on                                        \n  retained                           0.3        1.1          \u2014  \n  interests and other net                                       \n  cash flows                                                    \n  Purchases of previously                                       \n  transferred                          \u2014        0.2          \u2014  \n  financial assets                                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millions                                                      \n  of                Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,  \n  dollars               2022             2021             2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying                                                      \n  value of     $         681    $         921    $       1,611  \n  retained                                                      \n  interests                                                     \n                                                                \nAll of Citi\u2019s retained\ninterests were held-to-\nmaturity securities as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAsset-Based Financing The\nCompany provides loans and\nother forms of financing to\nVIEs that hold assets.

For Citi to\nrealize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to\ndefault with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.\n                                                                \n                           December 31,                         \n                                   2022                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In millions of        Totalunconsoli\u2026        Maximumexposure  \n  dollars                        assets       tounconsolidated  \n                                                          VIEs  \n  Type                                                          \n  Commercial and                                                \n  other real         $           43,236    $             8,806  \n  estate                                                        \n  Corporate loans                23,120                 15,077  \n  Other                                                         \n  (including                                                    \n  investment                    166,320                 27,986  \n  funds,                                                        \n  airlines and                                                  \n  shipping)                                                     \n  Total              $          232,676    $            51,869  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                           December 31,                         \n                                   2021                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In millions of        Totalunconsoli\u2026        Maximumexposure  \n  dollars                        assets       tounconsolidated  \n                                                          VIEs  \n  Type                                                          \n  Commercial and                                                \n  other real         $           32,932    $             7,461  \n  estate                                                        \n  Corporate loans                18,257                 12,581  \n  Other                                                         \n  (including                                                    \n  investment                    184,358                 25,528  \n  funds,                                                        \n  airlines and                                                  \n  shipping)                                                     \n  Total              $          235,547    $            45,570  \n                                                                \nMunicipal Securities Tender\nOption Bond (TOB) Trusts\nMunicipal TOB trusts may hold\nfixed- or floating-rate,\ntaxable or tax-exempt\nsecurities issued by state and\nlocal governments and\nmunicipalities. TOB trusts are\ntypically structured as\nsingle-issuer entities whose\nassets are purchased from\neither the Company or from\nother investors in the\nmunicipal securities market.\nTOB trusts finance the\npurchase of their municipal\nassets by issuing two classes\nof certificates: long-dated,\nfloating rate certificates\n(\u201cFloaters\u201d) that are putable\npursuant to a liquidity\nfacility and residual interest\ncertificates (\u201cResiduals\u201d).\nThe Floaters are purchased by\nthird-party investors,\ntypically tax-exempt money\nmarket funds. The Residuals\nare purchased by the original\nowner of the municipal\nsecurities that are being\nfinanced. From Citigroup\u2019s\nperspective, there are\ntwotypes of TOB trusts:\ncustomer and non-customer.\nCustomer TOB trusts are those\ntrusts utilized by customers\nof the Company to finance\ntheir securities, generally\nmunicipal securities. The\nResiduals issued by these\ntrusts are purchased by the\ncustomer being financed. Non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are\ngenerally used by the Company\nto finance its own municipal\nsecurities investments; the\nResiduals issued by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts are\npurchased by the Company. With\nrespect to both customer and\nnon-customer TOB trusts, Citi\nmay provide remarketing agent\nservices. If Floaters are\noptionally tendered and the\nCompany, in its role as\nremarketing agent, is unable\nto find a new investor to\npurchase the optionally\ntendered Floaters within a\nspecified period of time,\nCitigroup may, but is not\nobligated to, purchase the\ntendered Floaters into its own\ninventory. The level of the\nCompany\u2019s inventory of such\nFloaters fluctuates. For\ncertain customer TOB trusts,\nCiti may also serve as a\nvoluntary advance provider. In\nthis capacity, the Company\nmay, but is not obligated to,\nmake loan advances to customer\nTOB trusts to purchase\noptionally tendered Floaters\nthat have not otherwise been\nsuccessfully remarketed to new\ninvestors. Such loans are\nsecured by pledged Floaters.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Citi\nhad no outstanding voluntary\nadvances to customer TOB\ntrusts. For certain non-\ncustomer trusts, the Company\nalso provides credit\nenhancement. At December 31,\n2022 and 2021, noneof the\nmunicipal bonds owned by non-\ncustomer TOB trusts were\nsubject to a credit guarantee\nprovided by the Company.\n                              248                               \nCitigroup also provides\nliquidity services to many\ncustomer and non-customer\ntrusts. If a trust is unwound\nearly due to an event other\nthan a credit event on the\nunderlying municipal bonds,\nthe underlying municipal bonds\nare sold out of the trust and\nbond sale proceeds are used to\nredeem the outstanding trust\ncertificates. If this results\nin a shortfall between the\nbond sale proceeds and the\nredemption price of the\ntendered Floaters, the\nCompany, pursuant to the\nliquidity agreement, would be\nobligated to make a payment to\nthe trust to satisfy that\nshortfall. For certain\ncustomer TOB trusts, Citigroup\nhas also executed a\nreimbursement agreement with\nthe holder of the Residual,\npursuant to which the Residual\nholder is obligated to\nreimburse the Company for any\npayment the Company makes\nunder the liquidity\narrangement. These\nreimbursement agreements may\nbe subject to daily margining\nbased on changes in the market\nvalue of the underlying\nmunicipal bonds. In cases\nwhere a third party provides\nliquidity to a non-customer\nTOB trust, a similar\nreimbursement arrangement may\nbe executed, whereby the\nCompany (or a consolidated\nsubsidiary of the Company), as\nResidual holder, would absorb\nany losses incurred by the\nliquidity provider. For\ncertain other non-customer TOB\ntrusts, Citi serves as tender\noption provider. The tender\noption provider arrangement\nallows Floater holders to put\ntheir interests directly to\nthe Company at any time,\nsubject to the requisite\nnotice period requirements, at\na price of par. At December\n31, 2022 and 2021, liquidity\nagreements provided with\nrespect to customer TOB trusts\ntotaled $ 1.1billion and $\n1.5billion, respectively, of\nwhich $ 0.7billion and $\n0.6billion, respectively, were\noffset by reimbursement\nagreements. For the remaining\nexposure related to TOB\ntransactions, where the\nresidual owned by the customer\nwas at least 25% of the bond\nvalue at the inception of the\ntransaction, no reimbursement\nagreement was executed. Citi\nconsiders both customer and\nnon-customer TOB trusts to be\nVIEs. Customer TOB trusts are\nnot consolidated by the\nCompany, as the power to\ndirect the activities that\nmost significantly impact the\ntrust\u2019s economic performance\nrests with the customer\nResidual holder, which may\nunilaterally cause the sale of\nthe trust\u2019s bonds. Non-\ncustomer TOB trusts generally\nare consolidated because the\nCompany holds the Residual\ninterest and thus has the\nunilateral power to cause the\nsale of the trust\u2019s bonds. The\nCompany also provides other\nliquidity agreements or\nletters of credit to customer-\nsponsored municipal investment\nfunds, which are not variable\ninterest entities, and\nmunicipality-related issuers\nthat totaled $ 1.4billion as\nof December 31, 2022 and $\n2billion as of December 31,\n2021. These liquidity\nagreements and letters of\ncredit are offset by\nreimbursement agreements with\nvarious term-out provisions.\nMunicipal Investments\nMunicipal investment\ntransactions include debt and\nequity interests in\npartnerships that finance the\nconstruction and\nrehabilitation of low-income\nhousing, facilitate lending in\nnew or underserved markets or\nfinance the construction or\noperation of renewable\nmunicipal energy facilities.\nCiti generally invests in\nthese partnerships as a\nlimited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the\nreceipt of tax credits and\n\ngrants earned from the\ninvestments made by the\npartnership. The Company may\nalso provide construction\nloans or permanent loans for\nthe development or operation\nof real estate properties held\nby partnerships. These\nentities are generally\nconsidered VIEs. The power to\ndirect the activities of these\nentities is typically held by\nthe general partner.\nAccordingly, these entities\nare not consolidated by\nCitigroup. Client\nIntermediation Client\nintermediation transactions\nrepresent a range of\ntransactions designed to\nprovide investors with\nspecified returns based on the\nreturns of an underlying\nsecurity, referenced asset or\nindex. These transactions\ninclude credit-linked notes\nand equity-linked notes. In\nthese transactions, the VIE\ntypically obtains exposure to\nthe underlying security,\nreferenced asset or index\nthrough a derivative\ninstrument, such as a total-\nreturn swap or a credit-\ndefault swap. In turn, the VIE\nissues notes to investors that\npay a return based on the\nspecified underlying security,\nreferenced asset or index. The\nVIE invests the proceeds in a\nfinancial asset or a\nguaranteed insurance contract\nthat serves as collateral for\nthe derivative contract over\nthe term of the transaction.\nThe Company\u2019s involvement in\nthese transactions includes\nbeing the counterparty to the\nVIE\u2019s derivative instruments\nand investing in a portion of\nthe notes issued by the VIE.\nIn certain transactions, the\ninvestor\u2019s maximum risk of\nloss is limited and the\nCompany absorbs risk of loss\nabove a specified level. Citi\ndoes not have the power to\ndirect the activities of the\nVIEs that most significantly\nimpact their economic\nperformance and thus it does\nnot consolidate them. Citi\u2019s\nmaximum risk of loss in these\ntransactions is defined as the\namount invested in notes\nissued by the VIE and the\nnotional amount of any risk of\nloss absorbed by Citi through\na separate instrument issued\nby the VIE. The derivative\ninstrument held by the Company\nmay generate a receivable from\nthe VIE (e.g., where the\nCompany purchases credit\nprotection from the VIE in\nconnection with the VIE\u2019s\nissuance of a credit-linked\nnote), which is collateralized\nby the assets owned by the\nVIE. These derivative\ninstruments are not considered\nvariable interests and any\nassociated receivables are not\nincluded in the calculation of\nmaximum exposure to the VIE.\nInvestment Funds The Company\nis the investment manager for\ncertain investment funds and\nretirement funds that invest\nin various asset classes\nincluding private equity,\nhedge funds, real estate,\nfixed income and\ninfrastructure. Citigroup\nearns a management fee, which\nis a percentage of capital\nunder management, and may earn\nperformance fees. In addition,\nfor some of these funds the\nCompany has an ownership\ninterest in the investment\nfunds. Citi has also\nestablished a number of\ninvestment funds as\nopportunities for qualified\nemployees to invest in private\nequity investments. The\nCompany acts as investment\nmanager for these funds and\nmay provide employees with\nfinancing on both recourse and\nnon-recourse bases for a\nportion of the employees\u2019\ninvestment commitments.\n                              249                               \n                                                                \n  23. DERIVATIVES                                               \n                                                                \nIn the ordinary course of\nbusiness, Citigroup enters\ninto various types of\nderivative transactions, which\ninclude: \u2022 Futures and forward\ncontracts , which are\ncommitments to buy or sell at\na future date a financial\ninstrument, commodity or\ncurrency at a contracted price\nthat may be settled in cash or\nthrough delivery of an item\nreadily convertible to cash. \u2022\nSwap contracts , which are\ncommitments to settle in cash\nat a future date or dates that\nmay range from a few days to a\nnumber of years, based on\ndifferentials between\nspecified indices or financial\ninstruments, as applied to a\nnotional principal amount. \u2022\nOption contracts , which give\nthe purchaser, for a premium,\nthe right, but not the\nobligation, to buy or sell\nwithin a specified time a\nfinancial instrument,\ncommodity or currency at a\ncontracted price that may also\nbe settled in cash, based on\ndifferentials between\nspecified indices or prices.\nSwaps, forwards and some\noption contracts are over-the-\ncounter (OTC) derivatives that\nare bilaterally negotiated\nwith counterparties and\nsettled with those\ncounterparties, except for\nswap contracts that are\nnovated and \u201ccleared\u201d through\ncentral counterparties (CCPs).\nFutures contracts and other\noption contracts are\nstandardized contracts that\nare traded on an exchange with\na CCP as the counterparty from\nthe inception of the\ntransaction. Citigroup enters\ninto derivative contracts\nrelating to interest rate,\nforeign currency, commodity\nand other market/credit risks\nfor the following reasons: \u2022\nTrading Purposes : Citigroup\ntrades derivatives as an\nactive market maker. Citigroup\noffers its customers\nderivatives in connection with\ntheir risk management actions\nto transfer, modify or reduce\ntheir interest rate, foreign\nexchange and other\nmarket/credit risks or for\ntheir own trading purposes.\nCitigroup also manages its\nderivative risk positions\nthrough offsetting trade\nactivities, controls focused\non price verification and\ndaily reporting of positions\nto senior managers. \u2022 Hedging\n: Citigroup uses derivatives\nin connection with its own\nrisk management activities to\nhedge certain risks or\nreposition the risk profile of\nthe Company. Hedging may be\naccomplished by applying hedge\naccounting in accordance with\nASC 815, Derivatives and\nHedging . For example,\nCitigroup issues fixed-rate\nlong-term debt and then enters\ninto a receive-fixed, pay-\nvariable-rate interest rate\nswap with the same tenor and\nnotional amount to\nsynthetically convert the\ninterest payments to a net\nvariable-rate basis. This\nstrategy is the most common\nform of an interest rate\nhedge, as it minimizes net\ninterest cost in certain yield\ncurve environments.\nDerivatives are also used to\nmanage market risks inherent\nin specific groups of on-\nbalance sheet assets and\nliabilities, including AFS\nsecurities, commodities and\nborrowings, as well as other\ninterest-sensitive assets and\nliabilities. In addition,\nforeign exchange contracts are\nused to hedge non-U.S.-dollar-\ndenominated debt, foreign\ncurrency-denominated AFS\nsecurities and net investment\nexposures.\n\nDerivatives may expose\nCitigroup to market, credit or\nliquidity risks in excess of\nthe amounts recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nMarket risk on a derivative\nproduct is the exposure\ncreated by potential\nfluctuations in interest\nrates, market prices, foreign\nexchange rates and other\nfactors and is a function of\nthe type of product, the\nvolume of transactions, the\ntenor and terms of the\nagreement and the underlying\nvolatility. Credit risk is the\nexposure to loss in the event\nof nonperformance by the other\nparty to satisfy a derivative\nliability where the value of\nany collateral held by Citi is\nnot adequate to cover such\nlosses. The recognition in\nearnings of unrealized gains\non derivative transactions is\nsubject to management\u2019s\nassessment of the probability\nof counterparty default.\nLiquidity risk is the\npotential exposure that arises\nwhen the size of a derivative\nposition may affect the\nability to monetize the\nposition in a reasonable\nperiod of time and at a\nreasonable cost in periods of\nhigh volatility and financial\nstress. Derivative\ntransactions are customarily\ndocumented under industry\nstandard master netting\nagreements, which provide that\nfollowing an event of default,\nthe non-defaulting party may\npromptly terminate all\ntransactions between the\nparties and determine the net\namount due to be paid to, or\nby, the defaulting party.\nEvents of default include (i)\nfailure to make a payment on a\nderivative transaction that\nremains uncured following\napplicable notice and grace\nperiods, (ii) breach of\nagreement that remains uncured\nafter applicable notice and\ngrace periods, (iii) breach of\na representation, (iv) cross\ndefault, either to third-party\ndebt or to other derivative\ntransactions entered into\nbetween the parties, or, in\nsome cases, their affiliates,\n(v) the occurrence of a merger\nor consolidation that results\nin the creditworthiness of a\nparty becoming materially\nweaker and (vi) the cessation\nor repudiation of any\napplicable guarantee or other\ncredit support document.\nObligations under master\nnetting agreements are often\nsecured by collateral posted\nunder an industry standard\ncredit support annex to the\nmaster netting agreement. An\nevent of default may also\noccur under a credit support\nannex if a party fails to make\na collateral delivery that\nremains uncured following\napplicable notice and grace\nperiods. The netting and\ncollateral rights incorporated\nin the master netting\nagreements are considered to\nbe legally enforceable if a\nsupportive legal opinion has\nbeen obtained from counsel of\nrecognized standing that\nprovides (i) the requisite\nlevel of certainty regarding\nenforceability and (ii) that\nthe exercise of rights by the\nnon-defaulting party to\nterminate and close-out\ntransactions on a net basis\nunder these agreements will\nnot be stayed or avoided under\napplicable law upon an event\nof default, including\nbankruptcy, insolvency or\nsimilar proceeding. A legal\nopinion may not be sought for\ncertain jurisdictions where\nlocal law is silent or unclear\nas to the enforceability of\nsuch rights or where adverse\ncase law or conflicting\nregulation may cast doubt on\nthe enforceability of such\nrights. In some jurisdictions\nand for some counterparty\ntypes, the insolvency law may\nnot provide the requisite\nlevel of certainty. For\nexample, this may be the case\nfor certain sovereigns,\nmunicipalities, central banks\nand U.S. pension plans.\n                              250                               \nExposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market\nvolatility, which may impair the ability of counterparties to\nsatisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit limits are\nestablished and closely monitored for customers engaged in\nderivatives transactions. Citi considers the level of legal\ncertainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights\nunder master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be\nan important factor in its risk management process.\nSpecifically, Citi generally transacts much lower volumes of\nderivatives under master netting agreements where Citi does not\nhave the requisite level of legal certainty regarding\nenforceability, because such derivatives consume greater amounts\nof single counterparty credit limits than those executed under\nenforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral and\nsecurity collateral in the form of G10 government debt\nsecurities are often posted by a party to a master netting\nagreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party;\nthe receiving party is free to commingle/rehypothecate such\ncollateral in the ordinary course of its business. Nonstandard\ncollateral such as corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. agency\nsecurities and/or MBS may also be pledged as collateral for\nderivative transactions. Security collateral posted to open and\nmaintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty, in the\nform of cash and/or securities, may from time to time be\nsegregated in an account at a third-party custodian pursuant to\na tri-party account control agreement. Information pertaining to\nCitigroup\u2019s derivatives activities, based on notional amounts,\nis presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are\nreference amounts from which contractual payments are derived\nand do not represent a complete measure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions. Citi\u2019s derivative exposure arises\nprimarily from market fluctuations (i.e., market risk),\ncounterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high\nvolatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well\nas any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the\ntransactions. Moreover, notional amounts do not reflect the\nnetting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and\noffsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed\nposition with a different counterparty, $200 million in\nderivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting\npositions may result in de minimis overall market risk. In\naddition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate\nfrom period to period in the normal course of business based on\nCiti\u2019s market share, levels of client activity and other\nfactors. All derivatives are recorded in Trading account assets/\nTrading account liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n                              251                               \nDerivative

As a\ngeneral rule, hedge accounting\nis permitted where the Company\nis exposed to a particular\nrisk, such as interest rate or\nforeign exchange risk, that\ncauses changes in the fair\nvalue of an asset or liability\nor variability in the expected\nfuture cash flows of an\nexisting asset, liability or a\nforecasted transaction that\nmay affect earnings.\nDerivative contracts hedging\nthe risks associated with\nchanges in fair value are\nreferred to as fair value\nhedges, while contracts\nhedging the variability of\nexpected future cash flows are\ncash flow hedges. Hedges that\nutilize derivatives or debt\ninstruments to manage the\nforeign exchange risk\nassociated with equity\ninvestments in\nnon-U.S.-dollar-functional-\ncurrency foreign subsidiaries\n(i.e., net investment in a\nforeign operation) are net\ninvestment hedges. To qualify\nas an accounting hedge under\nthe hedge accounting rules\n(versus an economic hedge\nwhere hedge accounting is not\napplied), a hedging\nrelationship must be highly\neffective in offsetting the\nrisk designated as being\nhedged. The hedging\nrelationship must be formally\ndocumented at inception,\ndetailing the particular risk\nmanagement objective and\nstrategy for the hedge. This\nincludes the item and risk(s)\nbeing hedged, the hedging\ninstrument being used and how\neffectiveness will be\nassessed. The effectiveness of\nthese hedging relationships is\nevaluated at hedge inception\nand on an ongoing basis both\non a retrospective and\nprospective basis, typically\nusing quantitative measures of\ncorrelation, with hedge\nineffectiveness measured and\nrecorded in current earnings.\nHedge effectiveness assessment\nmethodologies are performed in\na similar manner for similar\nhedges, and are used\nconsistently throughout the\nhedging relationships. The\n\nassessment of effectiveness\nmay exclude changes in the\nvalue of the hedged item that\nare unrelated to the risks\nbeing hedged and the changes\nin fair value of the\nderivative associated with\ntime value. Citi excludes\nchanges in the cross-currency\nbasis associated with cross-\ncurrency swaps from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income\n. Discontinued Hedge\nAccounting A hedging\ninstrument must be highly\neffective in accomplishing the\nhedge objective of offsetting\neither changes in the fair\nvalue or cash flows of the\nhedged item for the risk being\nhedged. Management may\nvoluntarily de-designate an\naccounting hedge at any time,\nbut if a hedging relationship\nis not highly effective, it no\nlonger qualifies for hedge\naccounting and must be de-\ndesignated. Subsequent changes\nin the fair value of the\nderivative are recognized in\nOther revenue or Principal\ntransactions , similar to\ntrading derivatives, with no\noffset recorded related to the\nhedged item. For fair value\nhedges, any changes in the\ncarrying value of the hedged\nitem remain as part of the\nbasis of the asset or\nliability and are ultimately\nrealized as an element of the\nyield on the item. For cash\nflow hedges, changes in fair\nvalue of the end-user\nderivative remain in\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) and are included in the\nearnings of future periods\nwhen the forecasted hedged\ncash flows impact earnings.\nHowever, if it becomes\nprobable that some or all of\nthe hedged forecasted\ntransactions will not occur,\nany amounts that remain in\nAOCI related to these\ntransactions must be\nimmediately reflected in Other\nrevenue . The foregoing\ncriteria are applied on a\ndecentralized basis,\nconsistent with the level at\nwhich market risk is managed,\nbut are subject to various\nlimits and controls. The\nunderlying asset, liability or\nforecasted transaction may be\nan individual item or a\nportfolio of similar items.\nFair Value Hedges Hedging of\nBenchmark Interest Rate Risk\nCitigroup\u2019s fair value hedges,\nwhich include hedges of closed\npools of assets, are primarily\nhedges of fixed-rate long-term\ndebt or assets, such as\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities or loans. For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\n                              256                               \nHedging of Foreign Exchange Risk Citigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt securities and long-term debt that are\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of\nthe entity holding the securities or issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange\ncontract or a cross-currency swap contract. Changes in the fair\nvalue of the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference)\nof forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge. Citi also excludes changes in the\nfair value of cross-currency basis associated with cross-\ncurrency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecords them in Other comprehensive income. Hedging of Commodity\nPrice Risk Citigroup hedges the change in fair value\nattributable to spot price movements in physical commodities\ninventories. The hedging instrument is a futures contract to\nsell the underlying commodity. In this hedge, the change in the\ncarrying value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings,\nwhich offsets the change in the fair value of the futures\ncontract that is also reflected in earnings. Although the entire\nchange in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded\nin earnings, under certain hedge programs, Citigroup excludes\nchanges in the fair value of the forward points (i.e., spot-\nforward difference) of the futures contract from the assessment\nof hedge effectiveness, and they are generally reflected\ndirectly in earnings over the life of the hedge. Under other\nhedge programs, Citi excludes changes in the fair value of\nforward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecords them in Other comprehensive income .\n\nThe following

Variable cash flows from those\nliabilities are synthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows\nby entering into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps\nand receive-variable, pay-fixed forward-starting interest rate\nswaps. Variable cash flows associated with certain assets are\nsynthetically converted to fixed-rate cash flows by entering\ninto receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. These cash\nflow hedging relationships use either regression analysis or\ndollar-offset ratio analysis to assess whether the hedging\nrelationships are highly effective at inception and on an\nongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the entire change in the\nfair value of the hedging derivative is recognized in AOCI and\nthen reclassified to earnings in the same period that the\nforecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.

For all other hedges, the amounts\nreclassified to earnings are included primarily in Other revenue\nand Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of December 31, 2022\nis approximately $( 1.7) billion. The maximum length of time\nover which forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10years. The\nafter-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is shown in Note\n20.\n                              259                               \nNet Investment Hedges Consistent with ASC 830-20, Foreign\nCurrency Matters\u2014Foreign Currency Transactions , ASC 815 allows\nthe hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in\na foreign operation. Citigroup uses foreign currency forwards,\ncross-currency swaps, options and foreign currency-denominated\ndebt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated\nwith Citigroup\u2019s equity investments in several non-U.S.-dollar-\nfunctional-currency foreign subsidiaries. Citi records the\nchange in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the\ntranslation adjustment for the investments in these foreign\nsubsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment within\nAOCI . For derivatives designated as net investment hedges,\nCitigroup follows the forward-rate method outlined in ASC\n815-35-35. According to that method, all changes in fair value,\nincluding changes related to the forward-rate component of the\nforeign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign\ncurrency options, are recorded in Foreign currency translation\nadjustment within AOCI . For foreign currency-denominated debt\ninstruments that are designated as hedges of net investments,\nthe translation gain or loss that is recorded in Foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment is based on the spot exchange\nrate between the functional currency of the respective\nsubsidiary and the U.S. dollar, which is the functional currency\nof Citigroup. The pretax gain (loss) recorded in Foreign\ncurrency translation adjustment within AOCI , related to net\ninvestment hedges, was $ 370million, $ 855million and $( 600)\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 includes a $\n36million pretax loss related to net investment hedges,\nrespectively, which were reclassified from AOCI into earnings\n(recorded in Other revenue ). Economic Hedges Citigroup often\nuses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex\nor operationally burdensome. End-user derivatives that are\neconomic hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in value\nincluded in either Principal transactions or Other revenue . For\nasset/liability management hedging, fixed-rate long-term debt is\nrecorded at amortized cost under GAAP. For other hedges that\neither do not meet the ASC 815 hedging criteria or for which\nmanagement decides not to apply ASC 815 hedge accounting, the\nderivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with\nthe associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings, while\nthe debt continues to be carried at amortized cost. Therefore,\ncurrent earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and\nother factors that cause a change in the swap\u2019s value, but for\nwhich no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt.\nCitigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at\nfair value under the fair value option. Once the irrevocable\nelection is made upon issuance of the debt, the full change in\nfair value of the debt is reported in earnings. The changes in\nfair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected\nin earnings, which provides a natural offset to the debt\u2019s fair\nvalue change. To the extent that the two amounts differ because\nthe full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not\noffset by the interest rate swap, the difference is\nautomatically captured in current earnings. Additional economic\nhedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial\nloans and loan commitments. Citigroup periodically evaluates its\nhedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an\naccounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the\nrelative costs and benefits. Economic hedges are also employed\nwhen the hedged item itself is marked-to-market through current\nearnings, such as hedges of commitments to originate one- to\nfour-family mortgage loans to be HFS and MSRs. Credit\nDerivatives Citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit\nderivatives. Through these contracts, Citi either purchases or\nwrites protection on either a single name or a portfolio of\nreference credits. Citi also uses credit derivatives to help\nmitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan\nportfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client\ntransactions. Citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in\ncredit derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\napproximately 98% and 99%, respectively, of the gross\nreceivables are from counterparties with which Citi maintains\nmaster netting agreements, collateral agreements or settles\ndaily. A majority of Citi\u2019s top 15counterparties (by receivable\nbalance owed to Citi) are central clearing houses, banks,\nfinancial institutions or other dealers. Contracts with these\ncounterparties do not include ratings-based termination events.\nHowever, counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental\neffect by lowering the threshold at which Citi may call for\nadditional collateral. The range of credit derivatives entered\ninto includes credit default swaps, total return swaps, credit\noptions and credit-linked notes. A credit default swap is a\ncontract in which, for a fee, a protection seller agrees to\nreimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a\npredefined credit event on a reference entity. These credit\nevents are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and\nthe reference entity and are generally limited to the market\nstandard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the\nreference entity and, in a more limited range of transactions,\ndebt restructuring. Credit derivative transactions that\nreference emerging market entities also typically include\nadditional credit events to cover the acceleration of\nindebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment\nmoratorium. In certain transactions, protection may be provided\non a portfolio of reference entities or asset-backed securities.\nIf there is no credit event, as defined by the specific\nderivative contract, then the protection seller makes no\npayments to the protection buyer and receives only the\ncontractually specified fee. However, if a credit event occurs\nas defined in the specific derivative contract sold, the\nprotection seller will be required to make a payment to the\nprotection buyer. Under certain contracts, the seller of\nprotection may not be required to make a payment until a\nspecified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the\nportfolio and/or may only be required to pay for losses up to a\nspecified amount. A total return swap typically transfers the\ntotal economic performance of a reference asset, which includes\nall associated\n                              260                               \ncash flows, as well as capital\nappreciation or depreciation.\nThe protection buyer receives\na floating rate of interest\nand any depreciation on the\nreference asset from the\nprotection seller and, in\nreturn, the protection seller\nreceives the cash flows\nassociated with the reference\nasset plus any appreciation.\nThus, according to the total\nreturn swap agreement, the\nprotection seller will be\nobligated to make a payment\nany time the floating interest\nrate payment plus any\ndepreciation of the reference\nasset exceeds the cash flows\nassociated with the underlying\nasset. A total return swap may\nterminate upon a default of\nthe reference asset or a\ncredit event with respect to\nthe reference entity, subject\nto the provisions of the\nrelated total return swap\nagreement between the\nprotection seller and the\nprotection buyer. A credit\noption is a credit derivative\nthat allows investors to trade\nor hedge changes in the credit\nquality of a reference entity.\nFor example, in a credit\nspread option, the option\nwriter assumes the obligation\nto purchase or sell credit\nprotection on the reference\nentity at a specified \u201cstrike\u201d\nspread level. The option\npurchaser buys the right to\nsell credit default protection\non the reference entity to, or\npurchase it from, the option\nwriter at the strike spread\nlevel. The payments on credit\nspread options depend either\non a particular credit spread\nor the price of the underlying\ncredit-sensitive asset or\nother reference entity. The\noptions usually terminate if a\ncredit event occurs with\nrespect to the underlying\nreference entity. A credit-\nlinked note is a form of\ncredit derivative structured\nas a debt security with an\nembedded credit default swap.\nThe purchaser of the note\neffectively provides credit\nprotection to the issuer by\nagreeing to receive a return\nthat could be negatively\naffected by credit events on\nthe underlying reference\nentity. If the reference\nentity defaults, the note may\nbe cash settled or physically\nsettled by delivery of a debt\nsecurity of the reference\nentity. Thus, the maximum\namount of the note purchaser\u2019s\nexposure is the amount paid\nfor the credit-linked note.\n                              261                               \nThe following tables

For\nnotional amounts, Citi generally has a mismatch between the\ntotal notional amounts of protection purchased and sold, and it\nmay hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into\noffsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired. The\nopen risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely\nmatched after certain cash positions in reference assets are\nconsidered and after notional amounts are adjusted, either to a\nduration-based equivalent basis or to reflect the level of\nsubordination in tranched structures. The ratings of the credit\nderivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to\nevaluate payment/performance risk are based on the assigned\ninternal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be \u201cBaa/BBB\u201d and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. Citigroup\nevaluates the payment/performance risk of the credit derivatives\nfor which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit\nrating assigned to the underlying reference credit. Credit\nderivatives written on an underlying non-investment-grade\nreference entity represent greater payment risk to the Company.\nThe non-investment-grade category in the table above also\nincludes credit derivatives where the underlying reference\nentity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the\nderivative. The maximum potential amount of future payments\nunder credit derivative contracts presented in the table above\nis based on the notional value of the derivatives. The Company\nbelieves that the notional amount for credit protection sold is\nnot representative of the actual loss exposure based on\nhistorical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the\nvalue of the reference assets and the related cash flows. In\naccordance with most credit derivative contracts, should a\ncredit event occur, the Company usually is liable for the\ndifference between the protection sold and the value of the\nreference assets. Furthermore, the notional amount for credit\nprotection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral\npaid to a given counterparty, as such payments would be\ncalculated after netting all derivative exposures, including any\ncredit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a\nrelated master netting agreement. Due to such netting processes,\ndetermining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit\nderivative exposures alone is not possible. The Company actively\nmonitors open credit-risk exposures and manages this exposure by\nusing a variety of strategies, including purchased credit\nderivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings of the\nreferenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured\nin the table above. Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in\nDerivatives Certain derivative instruments contain provisions\nthat require the Company to either post additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the\noccurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of\nthe Company. These events, which are defined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit\nratings of the Company and its affiliates. The fair value\n(excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-\nrelated contingent features that were in a net liability\nposition at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 18billion and $\n19billion, respectively. The Company posted $ 15billion and $\n16billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course\nof business as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch\nby all threemajor rating agencies as of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany could be required to post an additional $ 0.9billion as\neither collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could be required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians collateral previously received from\nexisting derivative counterparties in the amount of $\n15.0million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in\naggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of\napproximately $ 0.9billion. Derivatives Accompanied by Financial\nAsset Transfers The Company executes total return swaps that\nprovide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the\neconomic return of the securities or other financial assets\nreferenced in the contract. In certain cases, the derivative\ntransaction is accompanied by the Company\u2019s transfer of the\nreferenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty, most\ntypically in response to the derivative counterparty\u2019s desire to\nhedge, in whole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the\nderivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded\nform. In certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as\nsales, resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred\n(see Note 1 for further discussion of the related sale\nconditions for transfers of financial assets). For a significant\nportion of the transactions, the Company has also executed\nanother total return swap where the Company passes on\nsubstantially all of the economic return of the referenced\nsecurities to a different third party seeking the exposure. In\nthose cases, the Company is not exposed, on a net basis, to\nchanges in the economic return of the referenced securities.\nThese transactions generally involve the transfer of the\nCompany\u2019s liquid government bonds, convertible bonds or publicly\ntraded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio\nand are executed with third-party financial institutions. The\naccompanying derivatives are typically total return swaps. The\nderivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin\nrequirements. When the conditions for sale accounting are met,\nthe Company reports the transfer of the referenced financial\nasset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying\nderivative transaction. These transactions generally do not\nresult in a gain or loss on the sale of the security, because\nthe transferred\n                              263                               \nsecurity was held at fair\nvalue in the Company\u2019s trading\nportfolio. For transfers of\nfinancial assets accounted for\nas a sale by the Company, and\nfor which the Company has\nretained substantially all of\nthe economic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n1.4billion and $ 2.9billion as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. At December 31,\n2022, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 1.4billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of December 31, 2022\nwas $ 27million recorded as\ngross derivative assets and $\n32million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2021 the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.9billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 13million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n58million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              264                               \n                                                                \n  24. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK                             \n                                                                \nConcentrations of credit risk\nexist when changes in\neconomic, industry or\ngeographic factors similarly\naffect groups of\ncounterparties whose aggregate\ncredit exposure is material in\nrelation to Citigroup\u2019s total\ncredit exposure. Although\nCitigroup\u2019s portfolio of\nfinancial instruments is\nbroadly diversified along\nindustry, product and\ngeographic lines, material\ntransactions are completed\nwith other financial\ninstitutions, particularly in\nthe securities trading,\nderivatives and foreign\nexchange businesses. In\nconnection with the Company\u2019s\nefforts to maintain a\ndiversified portfolio, the\nCompany limits its exposure to\nany one geographic region,\ncountry or individual creditor\nand monitors this exposure on\na continuous basis. At\nDecember 31, 2022, Citigroup\u2019s\nmost significant concentration\nof credit risk was with the\nU.S. government and its\nagencies. The Company\u2019s\nexposure, which primarily\nresults from trading assets\nand investments issued by the\nU.S. government and its\nagencies, amounted to $\n431.6billion and $\n414.5billion at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe German, Japanese and\nUnited Kingdom governments and\ntheir agencies, which are\nrated investment grade by both\nMoody\u2019s and S&P, were the next\nlargest exposures. The\nCompany\u2019s exposure to Germany\namounted to $ 48.3billion and\n$ 48.9billion at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to\nJapan amounted to $\n40.0billion and $ 30.1billion\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The Company\u2019s\nexposure to the United Kingdom\namounted to $ 31.7billion and\n$ 31.1billion at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe foreign government\nexposures are composed of\ninvestment securities, loans\nand trading assets. The\nCompany\u2019s exposure to states\nand municipalities amounted to\n$ 20.1billion and $\n22.0billion at December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively,\nand was composed of trading\nassets, investment securities,\nderivatives and lending\nactivities.\n                              265                               \n                                                                \n  25. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT                                    \n                                                                \nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement , defines fair\nvalue, establishes a\nconsistent framework for\nmeasuring fair value and\nrequires disclosures about\nfair value measurements. Fair\nvalue is defined as the price\nthat would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly\ntransaction between market\nparticipants at the\nmeasurement date, and\ntherefore represents an exit\nprice. Among other things, the\nstandard requires the Company\nto maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs\nwhen measuring fair value.\nUnder ASC 820-10, the\nprobability of counterparty\ndefault is factored into the\nvaluation of derivative and\nother positions, and the\nimpact of Citigroup\u2019s own\ncredit risk is also factored\ninto the valuation of\nderivatives and other\nliabilities that are measured\nat fair value. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nsignificant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022\nLevel 3: Valuations derived\nfrom valuation techniques in\nwhich one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers are unobservable . As\nrequired under the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data-driven selection\ncriteria to determine whether\nan instrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022\nThe determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based upon the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nDetermination of Fair Value\nFor assets and liabilities\ncarried at fair value, the\nCompany measures fair value\nusing the procedures set out\nbelow, irrespective of whether\nthe assets and liabilities are\nmeasured at fair value as a\nresult of an election, a non-\nrecurring lower-of-cost-or-\nmarket (LOCOM) adjustment, or\nbecause they are required to\nbe measured at fair value.\nWhen available, the Company\nuses quoted market prices from\nactive markets to determine\nfair value and classifies such\nitems as Level 1. In some\nspecific cases where a market\nprice is available, the\nCompany will apply practical\nexpedients (such as matrix\npricing) to calculate fair\nvalue, in which case the items\nmay be classified as Level 2.\nThe Company may also apply a\nprice-based methodology that\nutilizes, where available,\nquoted prices or other market\ninformation obtained from\nrecent trading activity in\npositions with the same or\nsimilar characteristics to the\nposition being valued. If\nrelevant and observable prices\nare available, those\nvaluations may be classified\nas Level 2. However, when\nthere are one or more\nsignificant unobservable\n\u201cprice\u201d inputs, those\nvaluations will be classified\nas Level 3. Furthermore, when\na quoted price is considered\nstale, a significant\nadjustment to the price of a\nsimilar security may be\nnecessary to reflect\ndifferences in the terms of\nthe actual security or loan\nbeing valued, or\nalternatively, when prices\nfrom independent sources may\nbe insufficient to corroborate\na valuation, the \u201cprice\u201d\ninputs are considered\nunobservable and the fair\nvalue measurements are\nclassified as Level 3. If\nquoted market prices are not\navailable, fair value is based\nupon internally developed\nvaluation techniques that use,\nwhere possible, current\nmarket-based parameters, such\nas interest rates, currency\nrates and option volatilities.\nItems valued using such\ninternally generated valuation\ntechniques are classified\naccording to the lowest level\ninput or value driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified as Level 3 even\nthough there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable. Fair value\nestimates from internal\nvaluation techniques are\nverified, where possible, to\nprices obtained from\nindependent vendors or\nbrokers. Vendors\u2019 and brokers\u2019\nvaluations may be based on a\nvariety of inputs ranging from\nobserved prices to proprietary\nvaluation models, and the\nCompany assesses the quality\nand relevance of this\ninformation in determining the\nestimate of fair value. The\nfollowing section describes\nthe valuation methodologies\nused by the Company to measure\nvarious financial instruments\nat fair value. Where\nappropriate, the description\nincludes details of the\nvaluation models, the key\ninputs to those models and any\nsignificant assumptions.\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nGenerally, the unit of account\nfor a financial instrument is\nthe individual financial\ninstrument. The Company\napplies market valuation\nadjustments that are\nconsistent with the unit of\naccount, which does not\ninclude adjustment due to the\nsize of the Company\u2019s\nposition, except as follows.\nASC 820-10 permits an\nexception, through an\naccounting policy election, to\nmeasure the fair value of a\nportfolio of financial assets\nand financial liabilities on\nthe basis of the net open risk\nposition when certain criteria\nare met. Citi has elected to\nmeasure\n                              266                               \ncertain portfolios of\nfinancial instruments that\nmeet those criteria, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open risk position.\nThe Company applies market\nvaluation adjustments,\nincluding adjustments to\naccount for the size of the\nnet open risk position,\nconsistent with market\nparticipant assumptions.\nValuation adjustments are\napplied to items classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 in the fair\nvalue hierarchy to ensure that\nthe fair value reflects the\nprice at which the net open\nrisk position could be exited.\nThese valuation adjustments\nare based on the bid/offer\nspread for an instrument in\nthe market. When Citi has\nelected to measure certain\nportfolios of financial\ninvestments, such as\nderivatives, on the basis of\nthe net open risk position,\nthe valuation adjustment may\ntake into account the size of\nthe position. Credit valuation\nadjustments (CVA) and funding\nvaluation adjustments (FVA)\nare applied to the relevant\npopulation of over-the-counter\n(OTC) derivative instruments\nwhere adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit risk, own\ncredit risk and term funding\nrisk are required to estimate\nfair value. This principally\nincludes derivatives with a\nbase valuation (e.g.,\ndiscounted using overnight\nindexed swap (OIS)) requiring\nadjustment for these effects,\nsuch as uncollateralized\ninterest rate swaps. The CVA\nrepresents a portfolio-level\nadjustment to reflect the risk\npremium associated with the\ncounterparty\u2019s (assets) or\nCiti\u2019s (liabilities) non-\nperformance risk. The FVA\nrepresents a market funding\nrisk premium inherent in the\nuncollateralized portion of a\nderivative portfolio and in\ncertain collateralized\nderivative portfolios that do\nnot include standard credit\nsupport annexes (CSAs), such\nas where the CSA does not\npermit the reuse of collateral\nreceived. Citi\u2019s FVA\nmethodology leverages the\nexisting CVA methodology to\nestimate a funding exposure\nprofile. The calculation of\nthis exposure profile\nconsiders collateral\nagreements in which the terms\ndo not permit the Company to\nreuse the collateral received,\nincluding where counterparties\npost collateral to third-party\ncustodians. Citi\u2019s CVA and FVA\nmethodologies consist of two\nsteps: \u2022 First, the exposure\nprofile for each counterparty\nis determined using the terms\nof all individual derivative\npositions and a Monte Carlo\nsimulation or other\nquantitative analysis to\ngenerate a series of expected\ncash flows at future points in\ntime. The calculation of this\nexposure profile considers the\neffect of credit risk\nmitigants and sources of\nfunding, including pledged\ncash or other collateral and\nany legal right of offset that\nexists with a counterparty\nthrough arrangements such as\nnetting agreements. Individual\nderivative contracts that are\nsubject to an enforceable\nmaster netting agreement with\na counterparty are aggregated\nas a netting set for this\npurpose, since it is those\naggregate net cash flows that\nare subject to nonperformance\nrisk. This process identifies\nspecific, point-in-time future\ncash flows that are subject to\nnonperformance and term\nfunding risk, rather than\nusing the current recognized\nnet asset or liability as a\nbasis to measure the CVA and\nFVA. \u2022 Second, for CVA,\nmarket-based views of default\nprobabilities derived from\nobserved credit spreads in the\ncredit default swap (CDS)\nmarket are applied to the\n\nexpected future cash flows\ndetermined in step one. Citi\u2019s\nown credit CVA is determined\nusing Citi-specific CDS\nspreads for the relevant\ntenor. Generally, counterparty\nCVA is determined using CDS\nspread indices for each credit\nrating and tenor. For certain\nidentified netting sets where\nindividual analysis is\npracticable (e.g., exposures\nto counterparties with liquid\nCDSs), counterparty-specific\nCDS spreads are used. For FVA,\na term structure of spreads is\napplied to the expected\nfunding exposures (e.g., the\nmarket liquidity spread used\nto represent the term funding\npremium associated with\ncertain OTC derivatives). The\nCVA and FVA are designed to\nincorporate a market view of\nthe credit and funding risk,\nrespectively, inherent in the\nderivative portfolio. However,\nmost unsecured derivative\ninstruments are negotiated\nbilateral contracts and are\nnot commonly transferred to\nthird parties. Derivative\ninstruments are normally\nsettled contractually or, if\nterminated early, are\nterminated at a value\nnegotiated bilaterally between\nthe counterparties. Thus, the\nCVA and FVA may not be\nrealized upon a settlement or\ntermination in the normal\ncourse of business. In\naddition, all or a portion of\nthese adjustments may be\nreversed or otherwise adjusted\nin future periods in the event\nof changes in the credit or\nfunding risk associated with\nthe derivative instruments.\nThe table below summarizes the CVA and FVA applied to the fair\nvalue of derivative instruments at December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n                                                                \n                                 Credit and                     \n                          funding valuation                     \n                                adjustments                     \n                           contra-liability                     \n                             (contra-asset)                     \n  In millions of               December 31,       December 31,  \n  dollars                              2022               2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Counterparty CVA     $               -816    $          -705  \n  Asset FVA                            -622               -433  \n  Citigroup (own                        607                379  \n  credit) CVA                                                   \n  Liability FVA                         263                110  \n  Total CVA and                                                 \n  FVA\u2014derivative       $               -568    $          -649  \n  instruments                                                   \n                                                                \n                              267                               \nThe table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to\nchanges in CVA on derivative instruments, net of hedges, FVA on\nderivatives and debt valuation adjustments (DVA) on Citi\u2019s own\nfair value option (FVO) liabilities for the years indicated:\n                                                                \n                        Credit/funding/\u2026                        \n                               valuation                        \n                        adjustments gain                        \n  In millions of                  (loss)                        \n  dollars                           2022       2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Counterparty       $              -227    $    79    $  -101  \n  CVA                                                           \n  Asset FVA                         -102         96        -95  \n  Own credit CVA                     157        -33        133  \n  Liability FVA                      155        -22         -6  \n  Total CVA and                                                 \n  FVA\u2014derivative     $               -17    $   120    $   -69  \n  instruments                                                   \n  DVA related to                                                \n  own FVO            $             2,685    $   296    $  -616  \n  liabilities(1)                                                \n  Total CVA, DVA     $             2,668    $   416    $  -685  \n  and FVA                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20.\nSecurities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell and\nSecurities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase No\nquoted prices exist for these\ninstruments, since fair value\nis determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow\ntechnique. Cash flows are\nestimated based on the terms\nof the contract, taking into\naccount any embedded\nderivatives or other features.\nThese cash flows are\ndiscounted using interest\nrates appropriate to the\nmaturity of the instrument as\nwell as the nature of the\nunderlying collateral.\nGenerally, when such\ninstruments are recorded at\nfair value, they are\nclassified within Level 2 of\nthe fair value hierarchy, as\nthe inputs used in the\nvaluation are readily\nobservable. However, certain\nlong-dated positions are\nclassified within Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy.\nTrading Account Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Trading Securities\nand Trading Loans When\navailable, the Company uses\nquoted market prices in active\nmarkets to determine the fair\nvalue of trading securities;\nsuch items are classified as\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy. Examples include\ngovernment securities and\nexchange-traded equity\nsecurities. For bonds and\nsecondary market loans traded\nover the counter, the Company\ngenerally determines fair\nvalue utilizing various\nvaluation techniques,\nincluding discounted cash\nflows, price-based and\ninternal models. Fair value\nestimates from these internal\nvaluation techniques are\nverified, where possible, to\nprices obtained from\nindependent sources, including\nthird-party vendors. A price-\nbased methodology utilizes,\nwhere available, quoted prices\nor other market information\nobtained from recent trading\nactivity of assets with\nsimilar characteristics to the\nbond or loan being valued. The\nyields used in discounted cash\nflow models are derived from\nthe same price information.\nTrading securities and loans\npriced using such methods are\ngenerally classified as Level\n2. However, when the primary\ninputs to the valuation are\nunobservable, or prices from\nindependent sources are\ninsufficient to corroborate\nvaluation, a loan or security\nis\n\ngenerally classified as Level\n3. Fair value estimates from\nthese internal valuation\ntechniques are verified, where\npossible, to prices obtained\nfrom independent sources,\nincluding third-party vendors.\nWhen the Company\u2019s principal\nexit market for a portfolio of\nloans is through\nsecuritization, the Company\nuses the securitization price\nas a key input into the fair\nvalue of the loan portfolio.\nThe securitization price is\ndetermined from the assumed\nproceeds of a hypothetical\nsecuritization within the\ncurrent market environment.\nWhere such a price\nverification is possible, loan\nportfolios are typically\nclassified as Level 2 in the\nfair value hierarchy. For most\nof the subprime mortgage\nbacked security (MBS)\nexposures, fair value is\ndetermined utilizing\nobservable transactions where\navailable, or other valuation\ntechniques such as discounted\ncash flow analysis utilizing\nvaluation assumptions derived\nfrom similar, more observable\nsecurities as market proxies.\nThe valuation of certain\nasset-backed security (ABS)\nCDO positions is inferred\nthrough the net asset value of\nthe underlying assets of the\nABS CDO. Trading Account\nAssets and\nLiabilities\u2014Derivatives\nExchange-traded derivatives,\nmeasured at fair value using\nquoted (i.e., exchange) prices\nin active markets, where\navailable, are classified as\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy. Derivatives without\na quoted price in an active\nmarket and derivatives\nexecuted over the counter are\nvalued using internal\nvaluation techniques. These\nderivative instruments are\nclassified as either Level 2\nor Level 3 depending on the\nobservability of the\nsignificant inputs to the\nmodel. The valuation\ntechniques depend on the type\nof derivative and the nature\nof the underlying instrument.\nThe principal techniques used\nto value these instruments are\ndiscounted cash flows and\ninternal models, such as\nderivative pricing models\n(e.g., Black-Scholes and Monte\nCarlo simulations). The key\ninputs depend upon the type of\nderivative and the nature of\nthe underlying instrument and\ninclude interest rate yield\ncurves, foreign exchange\nrates, volatilities and\ncorrelation. Investments The\ninvestments category includes\navailable-for-sale debt and\nmarketable equity securities\nwhose fair values are\ngenerally determined by\nutilizing similar procedures\ndescribed for trading\nsecurities above or, in some\ncases, using vendor pricing as\nthe primary source. Also\nincluded in investments are\nnonpublic investments in\nprivate equity and real estate\nentities. Determining the fair\nvalue of nonpublic securities\ninvolves a significant degree\nof management judgment, as no\nquoted prices exist and such\nsecurities are not generally\ntraded. In addition, there may\nbe transfer restrictions on\nprivate equity securities. The\nCompany\u2019s process for\ndetermining the fair value of\nsuch securities utilizes\ncommonly accepted valuation\ntechniques, including\nguideline public company\nanalysis and comparable\ntransactions. In determining\nthe fair value of nonpublic\nsecurities, the Company also\nconsiders events such as a\nproposed sale of the investee\ncompany, initial public\nofferings, equity issuances or\nother observable transactions.\nPrivate\n                              268                               \nequity securities are\ngenerally classified as Level\n3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn addition, the Company holds\ninvestments in certain\nalternative investment funds\nthat calculate NAV per share,\nincluding hedge funds, private\nequity funds and real estate\nfunds. Investments in funds\nare generally classified as\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities carried at fair\nvalue. The fair values of\nthese investments are\nestimated using the NAV per\nshare of the Company\u2019s\nownership interest in the\nfunds where it is not probable\nthat the investment will be\nrealized at a price other than\nthe NAV. Consistent with the\nprovisions of ASU 2015-07,\nthese investments are\ncategorized within the fair\nvalue hierarchy and are not\nincluded in the tables below.\nSee Note 13 for additional\ninformation. Short-Term\nBorrowings and Long-Term Debt\nWhere fair value accounting\nhas been elected, the fair\nvalue of non-structured\nliabilities is determined by\nutilizing internal models\nusing the appropriate discount\nrate for the applicable\nmaturity. Such instruments are\nclassified as Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy when all\nsignificant inputs are readily\nobservable. The Company\ndetermines the fair value of\nhybrid financial instruments,\nincluding structured\nliabilities, using the\nappropriate derivative\nvaluation methodology\n(described above in \u201cTrading\nAccount Assets and\nLiabilities\u2014Derivatives\u201d)\ngiven the nature of the\nembedded risk profile. Such\ninstruments are classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 depending\non the observability of\nsignificant inputs to the\nmodel.\n                              269                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Of the $ 9.9billion transfer in, approximately $\n7.0billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs\nbecoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their\noverall valuation, and $ 2.9billion related to equity and credit\nderivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g.,\ninterest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or\nsignificant to their overall valuation. In other instances,\nmarket changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more\nobservable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less\nsignificant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g.,\nwhen an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money) . This\nhas resulted in $ 7.6billion of certain structured long-term\ndebt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during\nthe 12 months ended December 31, 2022. The following were the\nsignificant Level 3 transfers for the period December 31, 2020\nto December 31, 2021: \u2022 During the 12 months ended December 31,\n2021, transfers of Loans of $ 2.1billion from Level 3 to Level 2\nwere primarily driven by equity forward and volatility inputs\nthat have been assessed as not significant to the overall\nvaluation of certain hybrid loan instruments, including equity\noptions and long dated equity call spreads. \u2022 During the 12\nmonths ended December 31, 2021, transfers of Equity contracts of\n$ 1.1billion from Level 2 to Level 3 were due to equity forward\nand volatility inputs becoming an unobservable and/or\nsignificant input relative to the overall valuation of equity\noptions and equity swaps. In other instances, market changes\nhave resulted in observable equity forward and volatility inputs\nbecoming an insignificant input to the overall valuation of the\ninstrument (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of\nthe money). This has resulted in $ 1.9billion of certain equity\ncontracts being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2. \u2022 During\nthe 12 months ended December 31, 2021, transfers of Long-term\ndebt were $ 8.6billion from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $\n8.6billion transfer in, approximately $ 7.2billion related to\ninterest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable\nand/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $\n1.0billion related to equity volatility inputs (in addition to\nother volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs)\nbecoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall\nvaluation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in\nsome inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable\ninputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the\ninstruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of\nthe money) . This has resulted in $ 9.8billion of certain\nstructured long-term debt products being transferred from Level\n3 to Level 2 during the 12 months ended December 31, 2021.\n                              277                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements The Company\u2019s Level 3 inventory consists of both\ncash instruments and derivatives of varying complexity. The\nfollowing tables present the valuation techniques covering the\nmajority of Level 3 inventory and the most significant\nunobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements.\nMethodologies are applied consistently. Changes in listed inputs\nperiod versus period represent variables that become more, or\nless, significant, hence their addition or removal from the\ntable below. Differences between this table and amounts\npresented in the Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward table above\nrepresent individually immaterial items that have been measured\nusing a variety of valuation

\nUncertainty of Fair Value Measurements Relating to Unobservable\nInputs Valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient\nor dispersed market data to allow a precise determination of the\nexit value of a fair-valued position or portfolio in today\u2019s\nmarket. This is especially prevalent in Level 3 fair value\ninstruments, where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that\nmay be both unobservable and significant to the instrument\u2019s (or\nportfolio\u2019s) overall fair value measurement. The uncertainties\nassociated with key unobservable inputs on the Level 3 fair\nvalue measurements may not be independent of one another. In\naddition, the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair\nvalue measurement for a given change in an unobservable input\ndepends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the\nCompany holds the instrument as an asset or a liability. For\ncertain instruments, the pricing, hedging and risk management\nare sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather\nthan on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs.\nThe following section describes some of the most significant\nunobservable inputs used by the Company in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements. Correlation Correlation is a measure of the extent\nto which two or more variables change in relation to each other.\nA variety of correlation-related assumptions are required for a\nwide range of instruments, including equity and credit baskets,\nforeign exchange options, Credit Index Tranches and many other\ninstruments. For almost all of these instruments, correlations\nare not directly observable in the market and must be calculated\nusing alternative sources, including historical information.\nEstimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may\nvary over time, and calculating correlation information from\nmarket data requires significant assumptions regarding the\ninformational efficiency of the market (e.g., swaption markets).\nUncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate\nlevel of correlation as an input into some fair value\nmeasurements is required. Changes in correlation levels can have\na substantial impact, favorable or unfavorable, on the value of\nan instrument, depending on its nature. A change in the default\ncorrelation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising\na CDO structure would affect the fair value of the senior\ntranche. For example, an increase in the default correlation of\nthe underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior\ntranche, because highly correlated instruments produce greater\nlosses in the event of default and a portion of these losses\nwould become attributable to the senior tranche. That same\nchange in default correlation would have a different impact on\njunior tranches of the same structure. Volatility Volatility\nrepresents the speed and severity of market price changes and is\na key factor in pricing options. Volatility generally depends on\nthe tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or\nlevel defined in the contract. Volatilities for certain\ncombinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to\nbe estimated using alternative methods, such as comparable\ninstruments, historical analysis or other sources of market\ninformation. This leads to uncertainty around the final fair\nvalue measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities.\nThe general relationship between changes in the value of an\ninstrument (or a portfolio) to changes in volatility also\ndepends on changes in interest rates and the level of the\nunderlying index. Generally, long option positions (assets)\nbenefit from increases in volatility, whereas short option\npositions (liabilities) will suffer losses. Some instruments are\nmore sensitive to changes in volatility than others. For\nexample, an at-the-money option would experience a greater\npercentage change in its fair value than a deep-in-the-money\noption. In addition, the fair value of an option with more than\none underlying security (e.g., an option on a basket of\nequities) depends on the volatility of the individual underlying\nsecurities as well as their correlations. Yield In some\ncircumstances, the yield of an instrument is not observable in\nthe market and must be estimated from historical data or from\nyields of similar securities. This estimated yield may need to\nbe adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being\nvalued. Whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to\nthe value of the security, the fair value measurement is\nclassified as Level 3. Adjusted yield is generally used to\ndiscount the projected future principal and interest cash flows\non instruments, such as asset-backed securities. Adjusted yield\nis impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and\nrelevant credit spreads. Prepayment Voluntary unscheduled\npayments (prepayments) change the future cash flows for the\ninvestor and thereby change the fair value of the security. The\neffect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential\nmortgage-backed securities. Prepayment is generally negatively\ncorrelated with delinquency and interest rate. A combination of\nlow prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each input\u2019s\nnegative impact on a mortgage security\u2019s valuation. As\nprepayment speeds change, the weighted average life of the\nsecurity changes, which impacts the valuation either positively\nor negatively, depending upon the nature of the security and the\ndirection of the change in the weighted average life. Recovery\nRecovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a\nbond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation\nscenario. For many credit securities (e.g., commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities), the expected recovery amount of a defaulted\nproperty is typically unknown until a liquidation of the\nproperty is imminent. The assumed recovery of a security may\ndiffer from its actual recovery that will be observable in the\nfuture. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate assumption\nincreases the fair value of the security. An increase in loss\nseverity, the inverse of the recovery rate, reduces the amount\nof principal available for distribution and, as a result,\ndecreases the fair value of the security.\n                              281                               \nCredit Spread Credit spread is\na component of the security\nrepresenting its credit\nquality. Credit spread\nreflects the market perception\nof changes in prepayment,\ndelinquency and recovery\nrates, therefore capturing the\nimpact of other variables on\nthe fair value. Changes in\ncredit spread affect the fair\nvalue of securities\ndifferently depending on the\ncharacteristics and maturity\nprofile of the security. For\nexample, credit spread is a\nmore significant driver of the\nfair value measurement of a\nhigh-yield bond as compared to\nan investment-grade bond.\nGenerally, the credit spread\nfor an investment-grade bond\nis also more observable and\nless volatile than its high-\nyield counterpart.\n\nItems Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\n\nCertain assets and liabilities\nare measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and,\ntherefore, are not included in\nthe tables above. These\ninclude assets measured at\ncost that have been written\ndown to fair value during the\nperiods as a result of an\nimpairment. These also include\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities that have been\nmeasured using the measurement\nalternative and are either (i)\nwritten down to fair value\nduring the periods as a result\nof an impairment or (ii)\nadjusted upward or downward to\nfair value as a result of a\ntransaction observed during\nthe periods for an identical\nor similar investment in the\nsame issuer. In addition,\nthese assets include loans\nheld-for-sale and other real\nestate owned that are measured\nat the lower of cost or market\nvalue.\nThe following tables present\nthe carrying amounts of all\nassets that were still held\nfor which a nonrecurring fair\nvalue measurement was\nrecorded:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                                                       \n  December 31,                                                  \n  2022                  Fair value       Level\u00a02       Level\u00a03  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Loans HFS(1)       $       2,336    $      457    $    1,879  \n  Other real                     1             \u2014             1  \n  estate owned                                                  \n  Loans(2)                      69             \u2014            69  \n  Non-marketable                                                \n  equity                                                        \n  securities                   597             \u2014           597  \n  measured using                                                \n  the measurement                                               \n  alternative                                                   \n  Total assets at                                               \n  fair value on a    $       3,003    $      457    $    2,546  \n  nonrecurring                                                  \n  basis                                                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                                                       \n  December 31,                                                  \n  2021                  Fair value       Level\u00a02       Level\u00a03  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Loans HFS(1)       $       2,298    $      986    $    1,312  \n  Other real                    11             \u2014            11  \n  estate owned                                                  \n  Loans(2)                     144             \u2014           144  \n  Non-marketable                                                \n  equity                                                        \n  securities                   655           104           551  \n  measured using                                                \n  the measurement                                               \n  alternative                                                   \n  Total assets at                                               \n  fair value on a    $       3,108    $    1,090    $    2,018  \n  nonrecurring                                                  \n  basis                                                         \n                                                                \n(1) Net of fair value amounts\non the unfunded portion of\nloans HFS recognized as Other\nliabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Represents impaired loans\nheld for investment whose\ncarrying amount is based on\nthe fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less\ncosts to sell, primarily real\nestate.\nThe fair value of loans HFS is determined where possible using\nquoted secondary-market prices. If no such quoted price exists,\nthe fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a\nsimilar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of\nthat loan. Fair value for the other real estate owned is based\non appraisals. For loans whose carrying amount is based on the\nfair value of the underlying collateral, the fair values depend\non the type of collateral. Fair value of the collateral is\ntypically estimated based on quoted market prices if available,\nappraisals or other internal valuation techniques. Where the\nfair value of the related collateral is based on an appraised\nvalue, the loan is generally classified as Level 3. In addition,\nfor corporate loans, appraisals of the collateral are often\nbased on sales of similar assets; however, because the prices of\nsimilar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the\nunique features of the underlying collateral, these fair value\nmeasurements are generally classified as Level 3. The fair value\nof non-marketable equity securities under the measurement\nalternative is based on observed transaction prices for the\nidentical or similar investment of the same issuer, or an\ninternal valuation technique in the case of an impairment. Where\nthere are insufficient market observations to conclude the\ninputs are observable, where significant adjustments are made to\nthe observed transaction prices or when an internal valuation\ntechnique is used, the security is classified as Level 3. Fair\nvalue may differ from the observed transaction price due to a\nnumber of factors, including marketability adjustments and\ndifferences in rights and obligations when the observed\ntransaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.\n                              282                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Nonrecurring Fair\nValue Measurements\nThe

the carrying value and\nfair value of Citigroup\u2019s financial instruments that are not\ncarried at fair value. The tables below therefore exclude items\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the\ntables above. The disclosure also excludes leases, affiliate\ninvestments, pension and benefit obligations, certain insurance\ncontracts and tax-related items. Also, as required, the\ndisclosure excludes the effect of taxes, any premium or discount\nthat could result from offering for sale at one time the entire\nholdings of a particular instrument, excess fair value\nassociated with deposits with no fixed maturity and other\nexpenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In\naddition, the tables exclude the values of non-financial assets\nand liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise,\nrelationship and intangible values, which are integral to a full\nassessment of Citigroup\u2019s financial position and the value of\nits net assets. Fair values vary from period to period based on\nchanges in a wide range of factors, including interest rates,\ncredit quality and market perceptions of value, and as existing\nassets and liabilities run off and new transactions are entered\ninto.\n                                                                \n            Dec\u2026                   Est\u2026                         \n

See Notes 20 and 25.\n                              285                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 20\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a gain\nof $ 2,685million and $ 296million for the years ended December\n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting\nfrom changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated\nby incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads observable\nin the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to\nvalue each liability as described above. The Fair Value Option\nfor Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Selected\nPortfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell,\nSecurities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made\nbecause the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio\nbasis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are\naccounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair\nvalue for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . The related interest revenue and\ninterest expense are measured based on the contractual rates\nspecified in the transactions and are reported as Interest\nrevenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Certain Loans and Other Credit Products Citigroup has\nalso elected the fair value option for certain other originated\nand purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products,\nsuch as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by\nCitigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit\nproducts are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant\ngroups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products\nthat are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near\nterm, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with\nderivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps\nor total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on\nthe underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases\nwhere hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending\ntransactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                Decemb\u2026                                         \n                    31,                   December              \n                   2022                   31, 2021              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026       Trading       Loans        Trading       Loans  \n  of             assets                     assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $    6,011    $  5,360    $     9,530    $  6,082  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess            167          51           -100         226  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans               \u2014           2              \u2014           1  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value               \u2014           1              \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 729million and $\n719million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n                              286                               \nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the years ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to losses of\n$ 155million and $ 21million, respectively. Changes in fair\nvalue due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based\non changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery\nassumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals\nCitigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g.,\ngold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity\nand foreign currency trading activities or to economically hedge\ncertain exposures from issuing structured liabilities. Under ASC\n815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and\na commodity forward derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the\nfair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the\ndebt host contract within Trading account assets on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount\nof debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals\naccounts was approximately $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amounts are\nexpected to fluctuate based on trading activity in future\nperiods. As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading\nactivities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments\nand executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative\ncontracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an\nunallocated precious metals investment, Citi\u2019s receivable from\nits depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its\ninvestment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward\npurchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed\nto unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative,\nat fair value through earnings. As of December 31, 2022, there\nwere approximately $ 18.6billion and $ 10.8billion of notional\namounts of such forward purchase and forward sale derivative\ncontracts outstanding, respectively. Certain Investments in\nPrivate Equity and Real Estate Ventures Citigroup invests in\nprivate equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of\nearning investment returns and for capital appreciation. The\nCompany has elected the fair value option for certain of these\nventures, because such investments are considered similar to\nmany private equity or hedge fund activities in Citi\u2019s\ninvestment companies, which are reported at fair value. The fair\nvalue option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation\nof these investments. All investments (debt and equity) in such\nprivate equity and real estate entities are accounted for at\nfair value. These investments are classified as Investments on\nCitigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair\nvalues of these investments are classified in Other revenue in\nthe Company\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Mortgage\nLoans Held-for-Sale (HFS) Citigroup has elected the fair value\noption for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and\nconforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans\nare intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with\nderivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value\noption to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge\naccounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.\nThe following table provides information about certain mortgage\nloans HFS carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of          December 31,                          \n  dollars                         2022       December 31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the      $           793    $              3,035  \n  Consolidated                                                  \n  Balance Sheet                                                 \n  Aggregate fair                                                \n  value in excess                                               \n  of (less                         -10                      70  \n  than) unpaid                                                  \n  principal balance                                             \n  Balance of                                                    \n  non-accrual loans                                             \n  or loans                           1                       \u2014  \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past due                                                      \n  Aggregate unpaid                                              \n  principal balance                                             \n  in                                                            \n  excess of fair                                                \n  value for                          \u2014                       \u2014  \n  non-accrual                                                   \n  loans or loans                                                \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are\nreported in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

For certain contracts meeting the definition of a\nguarantee, the guarantor must recognize, at inception, a\nliability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in\nissuing the guarantee. In addition, the guarantor must disclose\nthe maximum potential amount of future payments that the\nguarantor could be required to make under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by the guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged.

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n(2) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, this maximum potential\nexposure was estimated to be approximately $ 130billion and $\n119billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants.\n                              290                               \nFinancial Standby Letters of Credit Citi issues standby letters\nof credit, which substitute its own credit for that of the\nborrower. If a letter of credit is drawn down, the borrower is\nobligated to repay Citi. Standby letters of credit protect a\nthird party from defaults on contractual obligations. Financial\nstandby letters of credit include (i) guarantees of payment of\ninsurance premiums and reinsurance risks that support industrial\nrevenue bond underwriting, (ii) settlement of payment\nobligations to clearing houses, including futures and over-the-\ncounter derivatives clearing (see further discussion below),\n(iii) support options and purchases of securities in lieu of\nescrow deposit accounts and (iv) letters of credit that backstop\nloans, credit facilities, promissory notes and trade\nacceptances. Performance Guarantees Performance guarantees and\nletters of credit are issued to guarantee a customer\u2019s tender\nbid on a construction or systems-installation project or to\nguarantee completion of such projects in accordance with\ncontract terms. They are also issued to support a customer\u2019s\nobligation to supply specified products, commodities or\nmaintenance or warranty services to a third party. Derivative\nInstruments Considered to Be Guarantees Derivatives are\nfinancial instruments whose cash flows are based on a notional\namount and an underlying instrument, reference credit or index,\nwhere there is little or no initial investment and whose terms\nrequire or permit net settlement. See Note 23 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities. Derivative instruments\nconsidered to be guarantees include only those instruments that\nrequire Citi to make payments to the counterparty based on\nchanges in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset,\na liability or an equity security held by the guaranteed party.\nMore specifically, derivative instruments considered to be\nguarantees include certain over-the-counter written put options\nwhere the counterparty is not a bank, hedge fund or broker-\ndealer (such counterparties are considered to be dealers in\nthese markets and may, therefore, not hold the underlying\ninstruments). Credit derivatives sold by Citi are excluded from\nthe tables above as they are disclosed separately in Note 23. In\ninstances where Citi\u2019s maximum potential future payment is\nunlimited, the notional amount of the contract is disclosed.\nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 10million and $ 19million at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and these amounts are\nincluded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSecurities Lending Indemnifications Owners of securities\nfrequently lend those securities for a fee to other parties who\nmay sell them short or deliver them to another party to satisfy\nsome other obligation. Banks may administer such securities\nlending programs for their clients. Securities lending\nindemnifications are issued by the bank to guarantee that a\nsecurities lending customer will be made whole in the event that\nthe security borrower does not return the security subject to\nthe lending agreement and collateral held is insufficient to\ncover the market value of the security. Credit Card Merchant\nProcessing Credit card merchant processing guarantees represent\nthe Company\u2019s indirect obligations in connection with (i)\nproviding transaction processing services to various merchants\nwith respect to its private label cards and (ii) potential\nliability for bank card transaction processing services. The\nnature of the liability in either case arises as a result of a\nbilling dispute between a merchant and a cardholder that is\nultimately resolved in the cardholder\u2019s favor. The merchant is\nliable to refund the amount to the cardholder. In general, if\nthe credit card processing company is unable to collect this\namount from the merchant, the credit card processing company\nbears the loss for the amount of the credit or refund paid to\nthe cardholder. With regard to (i) above, Citi has the primary\ncontingent liability with respect to its portfolio of private\nlabel merchants. The risk of loss is mitigated as the cash flows\nbetween Citi and the merchant are settled on a net basis, and\nCiti has the right to offset any payments with cash flows\notherwise due to the merchant. To further mitigate this risk,\nCiti may delay settlement, require a merchant to make an escrow\ndeposit, include event triggers to provide Citi with more\nfinancial and operational control in the event of the financial\ndeterioration of the merchant or require various credit\nenhancements (including letters of credit and bank guarantees).\nIn the unlikely event that a private label merchant is unable to\ndeliver products, services or a refund to its private label\ncardholders, Citi is contingently liable to credit or refund\ncardholders. With regard to (ii) above, Citi has a potential\nliability for bank card transactions where Citi provides the\ntransaction processing services as well as those where a third\nparty provides the services and Citi acts as a secondary\nguarantor, should that processor fail to perform. Citi\u2019s maximum\npotential contingent liability related to both bank card and\nprivate label merchant processing services is estimated to be\nthe total volume of credit card transactions that meet the\nrequirements to be valid charge-back transactions at any given\ntime. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, this maximum potential\nexposure was estimated to be $ 129.6billion and $ 119.4billion,\nrespectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure\nis not representative of the actual potential loss exposure\nbased on its historical experience. This contingent liability is\nunlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered\nwhen purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned\nto merchants. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its\n                              291                               \ncontingent liability related to merchant processing based on the\nfinancial strength of the primary guarantor, the extent and\nnature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss\nexperience. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the losses incurred\nand the carrying amounts of Citi\u2019s contingent obligations\nrelated to merchant processing activities were immaterial.\nCredit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of its\ncredit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide insurance coverage for rental\ncars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased\nproducts, price protection for certain purchases and protection\nfor lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the\ntable, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the actual and\nestimated losses incurred and the carrying value of Citi\u2019s\nobligations related to these programs were immaterial. Other\nRepresentation and Warranty Indemnifications In the normal\ncourse of business, Citi provides standard representations and\nwarranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with\nnumerous transactions and also provides indemnifications,\nincluding indemnifications that protect the counterparties to\nthe contracts in the event that additional taxes are owed, due\neither to a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation\nof the tax law. Counterparties to these transactions provide\nCiti with comparable indemnifications. While such\nrepresentations, warranties and indemnifications are essential\ncomponents of many contractual relationships, they do not\nrepresent the underlying business purpose for the transactions.\nThe indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms\nrelated to Citi\u2019s own performance under the terms of a contract\nand are entered into in the normal course of business based on\nan assessment that the risk of loss is remote. Often these\nclauses are intended to ensure that terms of a contract are met\nat inception. Nocompensation is received for these standard\nrepresentations and warranties, and it is not possible to\ndetermine their fair value because they rarely, if ever, result\nin a payment. In many cases, there are nostated or notional\namounts included in the indemnification clauses, and the\ncontingencies potentially triggering the obligation to indemnify\nhave not occurred and are not expected to occur. As a result,\nthese indemnifications are not included in the tables above.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 or 2021 for potential\nobligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement with VTN\nassociations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification In 2000,\nTravelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary of Citi,\nentered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the risks and\nrewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE Life (now\nGenworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a subsidiary of the\nGeneral Electric Company (GE). As part of this transaction, the\nreinsurance obligations were provided by two regulated insurance\nsubsidiaries of GE Life, which funded twocollateral trusts with\nsecurities. Presently, as discussed below, the trusts are\nreferred to as the Genworth Trusts. As part of GE\u2019s spin-off of\nGenworth in 2004, GE retained the risks and rewards associated\nwith the 2000 Travelers reinsurance agreement by providing a\nreinsurance contract to Genworth through GE\u2019s Union Fidelity\nLife Insurance Company (UFLIC) subsidiary that covers the\nTravelers LTC policies. In addition, GE provided a capital\nmaintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC that is designed to\nassure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay its reinsurance\nobligations. As a result of these reinsurance agreements and the\nspin-off of Genworth, Genworth has reinsurance protection from\nUFLIC (supported by GE) and has reinsurance obligations in\nconnection with the Travelers LTC policies. As noted below, the\nGenworth reinsurance obligations now benefit Brighthouse\nFinancial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While neither Brighthouse nor\nCiti are direct beneficiaries of the capital maintenance\nagreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse and Citi benefit\nindirectly from the existence of the capital maintenance\nagreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will continue to have\nfunds necessary to pay its reinsurance obligations to Genworth.\nIn connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of Travelers to MetLife Inc.\n(MetLife), Citi provided an indemnification to MetLife for\nlosses (including policyholder claims) relating to the LTC\nbusiness for the entire term of the Travelers LTC\n                              292                               \npolicies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by subsidiaries\nof Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail insurance\nbusiness to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers LTC policies\nnow reside with Brighthouse. The original reinsurance agreement\nbetween Travelers (now Brighthouse) and Genworth remains in\nplace and Brighthouse is the sole beneficiary of the Genworth\nTrusts. The Genworth Trusts are designed to provide collateral\nto Brighthouse in an amount equal to the statutory liabilities\nof Brighthouse in respect of the Travelers LTC policies. The\nassets in the Genworth Trusts are evaluated and adjusted\nperiodically to ensure that the fair value of the assets\ncontinues to provide collateral in an amount equal to these\nestimated statutory liabilities, as the liabilities change over\ntime. If both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original\nTravelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason,\nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the two\nGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021 related to this indemnification. However, if both\nevents become reasonably possible (meaning more than remote but\nless than probable), Citi will be required to estimate and\ndisclose a reasonably possible loss or range of loss to the\nextent that such an estimate could be made. In addition, if both\nevents become probable, Citi will be required to accrue for such\nliability in accordance with applicable accounting principles.\nFutures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides\nclearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients\nthat need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC)\nderivatives contracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and\ncircumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for\naccounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these\nclient transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the\nunderlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. See Note 23 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities that are reflected in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. As a clearing member, Citi\ncollects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin)\nbetween its clients and the respective CCP. In certain\ncircumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or\nsecurities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs.\nThis excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as\nbanks or carry brokers. There are twotypes of margin: initial\nand variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash\ninitial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial\nmargin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or\ndepository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables\n(payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and\ndue from banks , respectively. However, for exchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared derivatives contracts where Citi does not obtain\nbenefits from or control the client cash balances, the client\ncash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the\nCCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi\nhas contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 18.0billion and $ 18.7billion as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. Variation margin due from clients\nto the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts for\neach trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the\nrisk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to\npost variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the\nvalue of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of\nnon-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event\nthat the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n                              293                               \nCarrying Value\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At December 31,\n2022 and 2021, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.4billion and $\n1.4billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities. For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 51.8billion and $\n56.5billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSecurities and other marketable assets held as collateral\namounted to $ 63.7billion and $ 84.2billion at December 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to\nreimburse losses realized under securities lending\nindemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of\nCiti held as collateral amounted to $ 3.7billion and $\n4.1billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other\nproperty may also be available to Citi to cover losses under\ncertain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of\nsuch property has not been determined. Performance Risk Citi\nevaluates the performance risk of its guarantees based on the\nassigned referenced counterparty internal or external ratings.\nWhere external ratings are used, investment-grade ratings are\nconsidered to be Baa/BBB and above, while anything below is\nconsidered non-investment grade. Citi\u2019s internal ratings are in\nline with the related external rating system. On certain\nunderlying referenced assets or entities, ratings are not\navailable. Such referenced assets are included in the \u201cnot\nrated\u201d category. The maximum potential amount of the future\npayments related to the outstanding guarantees is determined to\nbe the notional amount of these contracts, which is the par\namount of the assets guaranteed. Presented in the tables below\nare the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are\nclassified based on internal and external credit ratings. The\ndetermination of the maximum potential future payments is based\non the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration\nof possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts\nbear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

the business HFS\ncountries under sales\nagreements are reflected in\ntheir original categories\nuntil the respective sales are\ncompleted.\n\nThe majority of unused\ncommitments are contingent\nupon customers maintaining\nspecific credit standards.\nCommercial commitments\ngenerally have floating\ninterest rates and fixed\nexpiration dates and may\nrequire payment of fees. Such\nfees (net of certain direct\ncosts) are deferred and, upon\nexercise of the commitment,\namortized over the life of the\nloan or, if exercise is deemed\nremote, amortized over the\ncommitment period. Commercial\nand Similar Letters of Credit\nA commercial letter of credit\nis an instrument by which\nCitigroup substitutes its\ncredit for that of a customer\nto enable the customer to\nfinance the purchase of goods\nor to incur other commitments.\nCitigroup issues a letter on\nbehalf of its client to a\nsupplier and agrees to pay the\nsupplier upon presentation of\ndocumentary evidence that the\nsupplier has performed in\naccordance with the terms of\nthe letter of credit. When a\nletter of credit is drawn, the\ncustomer is then required to\nreimburse Citigroup. One- to\nFour-Family Residential\nMortgages A one- to four-\nfamily residential mortgage\ncommitment is a written\nconfirmation from Citigroup to\na seller of a property that\nthe bank will advance the\nspecified sums enabling the\nbuyer to complete the\npurchase. Revolving Open-End\nLoans Secured by One- to Four-\nFamily Residential Properties\nRevolving open-end loans\nsecured by one- to four-family\nresidential properties are\nessentially home equity lines\nof credit. A home equity line\nof credit is a loan secured by\na primary residence or second\nhome to the extent of the\nexcess of fair market value\nover the debt outstanding for\nthe first mortgage. Commercial\nReal Estate, Construction and\nLand Development Commercial\nreal estate, construction and\nland development include\nunused portions of commitments\nto extend credit for the\npurpose of financing\ncommercial and multifamily\nresidential properties as well\nas land development projects.\n\nBoth secured-by-real-estate\nand unsecured commitments are\nincluded in this line, as well\nas undistributed loan\nproceeds, where there is an\nobligation to advance for\nconstruction progress\npayments. However, this line\nonly includes those extensions\nof credit that, once funded,\nwill be classified as Total\nloans, net on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. Credit Card\nLines Citigroup provides\ncredit to customers by issuing\ncredit cards. The credit card\nlines are cancelable by\nproviding notice to the\ncardholder or without such\nnotice as permitted by local\nlaw. Commercial and Other\nConsumer Loan Commitments\nCommercial and other consumer\nloan commitments include\noverdraft and liquidity\nfacilities as well as\ncommercial commitments to make\nor purchase loans, purchase\nthird-party receivables,\nprovide note issuance or\nrevolving underwriting\nfacilities and invest in the\nform of equity. Other\nCommitments and Contingencies\nOther commitments and\ncontingencies include all\nother transactions related to\ncommitments and contingencies\nnot reported on the lines\nabove. Unsettled Reverse\nRepurchase and Securities\nBorrowing Agreements and\nUnsettled Repurchase and\nSecurities Lending Agreements\nIn addition, in the normal\ncourse of business, Citigroup\nenters into reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021,\nCitigroup had approximately $\n111.6billion and $\n126.6billion of unsettled\nreverse repurchase and\nsecurities borrowing\nagreements, and approximately\n$ 37.3billion and $\n41.1billion of unsettled\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements,\nrespectively. See Note 11 for\na further discussion of\nsecurities purchased under\nagreements to resell and\nsecurities borrowed, and\nsecurities sold under\nagreements to repurchase and\nsecurities loaned, including\nthe Company\u2019s policy for\noffsetting repurchase and\nreverse repurchase agreements.\n                              295                               \n28. LEASES\n\nThe Company\u2019s operating\nleases, where Citi is a\nlessee, include real estate\nsuch as office space and\nbranches and various types of\nequipment.

ASC 450\ndefines a \u201closs contingency\u201d\nas \u201can existing condition,\nsituation, or set of\ncircumstances involving\nuncertainty as to possible\nloss to an entity that will\nultimately be resolved when\none or more future events\noccur or fail to occur.\u201d It\nimposes different requirements\nfor the recognition and\ndisclosure of loss\ncontingencies based on the\nlikelihood of occurrence of\nthe contingent future event or\nevents. It distinguishes among\ndegrees of likelihood using\nthe following three terms:\n\u201cprobable,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe\nfuture event or events are\nlikely to occur\u201d; \u201cremote,\u201d\nmeaning that \u201cthe chance of\nthe future event or events\noccurring is slight\u201d; and\n\u201creasonably possible,\u201d meaning\nthat \u201cthe chance of the future\nevent or events occurring is\nmore than remote but less than\nlikely.\u201d These three terms are\nused below as defined in ASC\n450. Accruals . ASC 450\nrequires accrual for a loss\ncontingency when it is\n\u201cprobable that one or more\nfuture events will occur\nconfirming the fact of loss\u201d\nand \u201cthe amount of the loss\ncan be reasonably estimated.\u201d\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. When the reasonable\nestimate of the loss is within\na range of amounts, the\nminimum amount of the range is\naccrued, unless some higher\namount within the range is a\nbetter estimate than any other\namount within the range. Once\nestablished, accruals are\nadjusted from time to time, as\nappropriate, in light of\nadditional information. The\namount of loss ultimately\nincurred in relation to those\nmatters may be substantially\nhigher or lower than the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters. Disclosure . ASC 450\nrequires disclosure of a loss\ncontingency if \u201cthere is at\nleast a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss or an additional\nloss may have been incurred\u201d\nand there is no accrual for\nthe loss because the\nconditions described above are\nnot met or an exposure to loss\nexists in excess of the amount\naccrued. In accordance with\nASC 450, if Citigroup has not\naccrued for a matter because\nCitigroup believes that a loss\nis reasonably possible but not\nprobable, or that a loss is\nprobable but not reasonably\nestimable, and the reasonably\npossible loss is material, it\ndiscloses the loss\ncontingency. In addition,\nCitigroup discloses matters\nfor which it has accrued if it\nbelieves a reasonably possible\nexposure to material loss\nexists in excess of the amount\naccrued. In accordance with\nASC 450, Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure includes an\nestimate of the reasonably\npossible loss or range of loss\nfor those matters as to which\nan estimate can be made. ASC\n450 does not require\ndisclosure of an estimate of\nthe reasonably possible loss\nor range of loss where an\nestimate cannot be made.\nNeither accrual nor disclosure\nis required for losses that\nare deemed remote. Litigation,\nRegulatory and Other\nContingencies Overview. In\naddition to the matters\ndescribed below, in the\nordinary course of business,\nCitigroup, its affiliates and\n\nsubsidiaries, and current and\nformer officers, directors and\nemployees (for purposes of\nthis section, sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties)\nroutinely are named as\ndefendants in, or as parties\nto, various legal actions and\nproceedings. Certain of these\nactions and proceedings assert\nclaims or seek relief in\nconnection with alleged\nviolations of consumer\nprotection, fair lending,\nsecurities, banking,\nantifraud, antitrust, anti-\nmoney laundering, employment\nand other statutory and common\nlaws. Certain of these actual\nor threatened legal actions\nand proceedings include claims\nfor substantial or\nindeterminate compensatory or\npunitive damages, or for\ninjunctive relief, and in some\ninstances seek recovery on a\nclass-wide basis. In the\nordinary course of business,\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nalso are subject to\ngovernmental and regulatory\nexaminations, information-\ngathering requests,\ninvestigations and proceedings\n(both formal and informal),\ncertain of which may result in\nadverse judgments,\nsettlements, fines, penalties,\nrestitution, disgorgement,\ninjunctions or other relief.\nIn addition, certain\naffiliates and subsidiaries of\nCitigroup are banks,\nregistered broker-dealers,\nfutures commission merchants,\ninvestment advisors or other\nregulated entities and, in\nthose capacities, are subject\nto regulation by various U.S.,\nstate and foreign securities,\nbanking, commodity futures,\nconsumer protection and other\nregulators. In connection with\nformal and informal inquiries\nby these regulators, Citigroup\nand such affiliates and\nsubsidiaries receive numerous\nrequests, subpoenas and orders\nseeking documents, testimony\nand other information in\nconnection with various\naspects of their regulated\nactivities. From time to time\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nalso receive grand jury\nsubpoenas and other requests\nfor information or assistance,\nformal or informal, from\nfederal or state law\nenforcement agencies\nincluding, among others,\nvarious United States\nAttorneys\u2019 Offices, the Money\nLaundering and Asset Recovery\nSection and other divisions of\nthe Department of Justice, the\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement\nNetwork of the United States\nDepartment of the Treasury,\nand the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation relating to\nCitigroup and its customers.\nBecause of the global scope of\nCitigroup\u2019s operations and its\npresence in countries around\nthe world, Citigroup and\nRelated Parties are subject to\nlitigation and governmental\nand regulatory examinations,\ninformation-gathering\nrequests, investigations and\nproceedings (both formal and\ninformal) in multiple\njurisdictions with legal,\nregulatory and tax regimes\nthat may differ substantially,\nand present substantially\ndifferent risks, from those\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nare subject to in the United\nStates. In some instances,\nCitigroup and Related Parties\nmay be involved in proceedings\ninvolving the same subject\nmatter in multiple\njurisdictions, which may\nresult in overlapping,\ncumulative or inconsistent\noutcomes. Citigroup seeks to\nresolve all litigation,\nregulatory, tax and other\nmatters in the manner\nmanagement believes is in the\nbest interests of Citigroup\nand its shareholders, and\ncontests liability,\nallegations of wrongdoing and,\nwhere applicable, the amount\nof damages or scope of any\npenalties or other relief\nsought as appropriate in each\npending matter. Inherent\nUncertainty of the Matters\nDisclosed. Certain of the\nmatters disclosed below\ninvolve claims for substantial\nor indeterminate damages. The\nclaims asserted in these\nmatters\n                              297                               \ntypically are broad, often spanning a multiyear period and\nsometimes a wide range of business activities, and the\nplaintiffs\u2019 or claimants\u2019 alleged damages frequently are not\nquantified or factually supported in the complaint or statement\nof claim. Other matters relate to regulatory investigations or\nproceedings, as to which there may be no objective basis for\nquantifying the range of potential fine, penalty or other\nremedy. As a result, Citigroup is often unable to estimate the\nloss in such matters, even if it believes that a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, until developments in the case,\nproceeding or investigation have yielded additional information\nsufficient to support a quantitative assessment of the range of\nreasonably possible loss. Such developments may include, among\nother things, discovery from adverse parties or third parties,\nrulings by the court on key issues, analysis by retained experts\nand engagement in settlement negotiations. Depending on a range\nof factors, such as the complexity of the facts, the novelty of\nthe legal theories, the pace of discovery, the court\u2019s\nscheduling order, the timing of court decisions and the adverse\nparty\u2019s, regulator\u2019s or other authority\u2019s willingness to\nnegotiate in good faith toward a resolution, it may be months or\nyears after the filing of a case or commencement of a proceeding\nor an investigation before an estimate of the range of\nreasonably possible loss can be made. Matters as to Which an\nEstimate Can Be Made . For some of the matters disclosed below,\nCitigroup is currently able to estimate a reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any). For\nsome of the matters included within this estimation, an accrual\nhas been made because a loss is believed to be both probable and\nreasonably estimable, but a reasonably possible exposure to loss\nexists in excess of the amount accrued. In these cases, the\nestimate reflects the reasonably possible range of loss in\nexcess of the accrued amount. For other matters included within\nthis estimation, no accrual has been made because a loss,\nalthough estimable, is believed to be reasonably possible, but\nnot probable; in these cases, the estimate reflects the\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss. As of December 31,\n2022, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued\nloss for these matters ranges up to approximately $ 1.2billion\nin the aggregate. These estimates are based on currently\navailable information. As available information changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and\nthe estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many\nestimates presented in financial statements and other financial\ndisclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably\npossible loss arising from litigation, regulatory and tax\nproceedings are subject to particular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making an estimate, (i) Citigroup may\nhave only preliminary, incomplete or inaccurate information\nabout the facts underlying the claim, (ii) its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the court, other tribunal or authority on\nsignificant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse\nparties, regulators or other authorities, may prove to be wrong\nand (iii) the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not\namenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative\nanalytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may\noccur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimate\nbecause it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all of\nthese reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued\nin relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included\nin the estimate. Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made\n. For other matters disclosed below, Citigroup is not currently\nable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.\nMany of these matters remain in very preliminary stages (even in\nsome cases where a substantial period of time has passed since\nthe commencement of the matter), with few or no substantive\nlegal decisions by the court, tribunal or other authority\ndefining the scope of the claims, the class (if any) or the\npotentially available damages or other exposure, and fact\ndiscovery is still in progress or has not yet begun. In many of\nthese matters, Citigroup has not yet answered the complaint or\nstatement of claim or asserted its defenses, nor has it engaged\nin any negotiations with the adverse party (whether a regulator,\ntaxing authority or a private party). For all these reasons,\nCitigroup cannot at this time estimate the reasonably possible\nloss or range of loss, if any, for these matters. Opinion of\nManagement as to Eventual Outcome. Subject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s management, based on current\nknowledge and after taking into account its current accruals,\nthat the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note\nwould not likely have a material adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless,\ngiven the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain\nof these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could,\nfrom time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular\nquarterly or annual periods. Foreign Exchange Matters Regulatory\nActions : Government and regulatory agencies in the U.S. and\nother jurisdictions are conducting investigations or making\ninquiries regarding Citigroup\u2019s foreign exchange business.\nCitigroup is cooperating with these and related investigations\nand inquiries. Antitrust and Other Litigation : In 2018, a\nnumber of institutional investors who opted out of the\npreviously disclosed August 2018 final settlement filed an\naction against Citigroup, Citibank, Citigroup Global Markets\nInc. (CGMI) and other defendants, captioned ALLIANZ GLOBAL\nINVESTORS, ET AL. v. BANK OF AMERICA CORP., ET AL., in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork. Plaintiffs allege that defendants manipulated, and\ncolluded to manipulate, the foreign exchange markets. Plaintiffs\nassert claims under the Sherman Act and unjust enrichment\nclaims, and seek consequential and punitive damages and other\nforms of relief. In July 2020, plaintiffs filed a third amended\ncomplaint. Additional information concerning this action is\npublicly available in court filings under the docket number\n18-CV-10364 (S.D.N.Y.) (Schofield, J.). In 2018, a group of\ninstitutional investors issued a claim against Citigroup,\nCitibank and other defendants, captioned ALLIANZ GLOBAL\nINVESTORS GMBH AND OTHERS v. BARCLAYS BANK PLC AND OTHERS, in\nthe High Court\n                              298                               \nof Justice in London.

This\nproceeding is captioned IN RE PAYMENT CARD INTERCHANGE FEE AND\nMERCHANT DISCOUNT ANTITRUST LITIGATION. The plaintiffs,\nmerchants that accept Visa and MasterCard branded payment cards,\nas well as various membership associations that claim to\nrepresent certain groups of merchants, allege, among other\nthings, that defendants have engaged in conspiracies to set the\nprice of interchange and merchant discount fees on credit and\ndebit card transactions\n                              299                               \nand to restrain trade unreasonably through various Visa and\nMasterCard rules governing merchant conduct, all in violation of\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act and certain California statutes.\nPlaintiffs further alleged violations of Section 2 of the\nSherman Act.

Citi\u2019s\ncompetitors include a variety\nof financial services and\nadvisory companies, as well as\ncertain non-financial services\nfirms.
