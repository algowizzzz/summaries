and\nOperational Resilience in a\nChallenging Environment\n\nAs described further\nthroughout this Executive\nSummary, during the second\nquarter of 2020, Citi\ndemonstrated continued\nfinancial strength and\noperational resilience,\ndespite a significant further\ndeterioration in economic\nconditions during the quarter\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s earnings were\nsubstantially reduced by a\nhigher allowance for credit\nloss (ACL) build\n(approximately $5.6 billion)\nduring the quarter (see \u201cCost\nof Credit\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 Despite the challenging\nenvironment, Citi had solid\nrevenue growth, as\nsignificantly higher revenues\nin Institutional Clients Group\n(ICG) , primarily reflecting\nstrong performance in fixed\nincome markets and investment\nbanking, were partially offset\nby lower revenues in Global\nConsumer Banking (GCB) ,\nreflecting lower loan volumes\nand lower interest rates.\n\n\u2022 Citi demonstrated good\nexpense discipline, resulting\nin a 1% decrease in expenses\nversus the prior year, as well\nas positive operating leverage\nand a 13% improvement in\noperating margin, while Citi\ncontinued to invest in its\ninfrastructure and controls as\nwell as digital capabilities.\n\n\u2022 Citi maintained its focus on\nrisk management, while\ncontinuing to support clients.\n\n\u2022 Citi had broad-based deposit\ngrowth across ICG and GCB ,\nreflecting strong client\nengagement, while also\nstrengthening Citi\u2019s available\nliquidity.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $1.1 billion\nof capital to its common\nshareholders in the form of\ndividends.\n\n\u2022 Citi continues to support\nits employees, customers and\nclients as well as the broader\neconomy during this\nchallenging time (see\n\u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Overview\u201d\nbelow) and maintained strong\nregulatory capital and\nliquidity metrics.\n\n\u2022 During the quarter, the\nFederal Reserve Board\ncommunicated that

Net income declined\n73%, driven by the\nsubstantially higher ACL\nbuilds, partially offset by\nthe higher revenues and a\nlower tax rate (see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates \u2014 Income Taxes\u201d\nbelow). Earnings per share\ndecreased 74%, driven by the\ndecline in net income.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $19.8\nbillion in the second quarter\nof 2020 increased 5% from the\nprior-year period, primarily\nreflecting the higher revenues\nin ICG , including the higher\nrevenues in fixed income\nmarkets and investment\nbanking, partially offset by\nthe lower revenues across\nregions in GCB .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were largely unchanged\nat $685 billion. Excluding the\nimpact of foreign currency\ntranslation into U.S. dollars\nfor reporting purposes (FX\ntranslation), Citigroup\u2019s end-\nof-period loans grew 1%, with\n5% growth in ICG partially\noffset by lower loans in GCB ,\nreflecting the impact of lower\nspend activity and the\ncontinued wind-down of legacy\nassets in Corporate/Other .\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits increased 18% to $1.2\ntrillion. Excluding the impact\nof FX translation, Citigroup\u2019s\nend-of-period deposits\nincreased 20%, primarily\ndriven by 22% growth in ICG\nand 15% growth in GCB .\n(Citi\u2019s results of operations\nexcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.)\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup operating expenses\nof $10.4 billion decreased 1%\nversus the prior-year period,\nas efficiency savings and\nlower marketing and other\ndiscretionary spend more than\noffset higher compensation\ncosts, investments and\npandemic-related expenses.\nYear-over-year, GCB and\nCorporate/Other operating\nexpenses declined 10% and 2%,\nrespectively, while ICG\nexpenses increased 7%.\n                               3                                \n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims of $7.9 billion,\ncompared to $2.1 billion in\nthe prior-year period, reflect\nthe ACL build and higher net\ncredit losses. Citi\u2019s ACL\nbuild increased to $5.6\nbillion, primarily reflecting\na deterioration in Citi\u2019s view\nof the macroeconomic outlook\nsince the end of the first\nquarter of 2020 under the\nCurrent Expected Credit losses\n(CECL) standard, as well as\ndowngrades in the corporate\nloan portfolio, in both cases\ndriven by the continued impact\nof the pandemic. The reserve\nbuild also included an\nadditional qualitative\nmanagement adjustment to\nreflect the potential for a\nhigher level of stress and/or\na somewhat slower economic\nrecovery.

Corporate\nnet credit losses increased to\n$324 million from $89 million\nin the prior-year period,\nprimarily reflecting write-\noffs across various sectors in\nboth North America and EMEA .\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs and ACL, also see\neach respective business\u2019s\nresults of operations and\n\u201cCredit Risk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier\n1 Capital ratio was 11.6% as\nof June 30, 2020, based on the\nBasel III Advanced Approaches\nframework for determining\nrisk-weighted assets, compared\nto 11.9% as of June 30, 2019,\nbased on the Basel III\nStandardized Approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets. The decline in the\nratio primarily reflected an\nincrease in risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nIncorporating Citi\u2019s interim\nSCB of 2.5%, and a GSIB\nsurcharge of 3%, results in a\nminimum regulatory requirement\nof 10% for both Standardized\n(using SCB) and Advanced\n(using the Capital\nConservation Buffer (CCB))\nApproaches, relative to Citi\u2019s\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio of\n11.6% using Advanced\nApproaches as of the second\nquarter of 2020.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of June 30,\n2020 was 6.7%, primarily\nreflecting the benefit of\ntemporary relief granted by\nthe Federal Reserve Board,\ncompared to 6.4% as of June\n30, 2019.

GCB operating\nexpenses of $4.0 billion\ndecreased 10%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nexpenses decreased 8%, as\nefficiency savings, lower\nvolume-related expenses and\nreductions in marketing and\nother discretionary\n\nspending were partially offset\nby increases in pandemic-\nrelated expenses.\n\nGCB revenues of $7.3 billion\ndecreased 10%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues decreased 7%, as\nlower loan volumes and lower\ninterest rates across all\nregions more than offset\nstrong deposit growth, each\nreflecting the continued\nimpact of the pandemic. North\nAmerica GCB revenues of $4.7\nbillion decreased 5%, as\nhigher revenues in Citi-\nbranded cards were more than\noffset by lower revenues in\nCiti retail services and\nretail banking. Citi-branded\ncards revenues of $2.2 billion\nincreased 1%, as lower\npurchase sales and lower\naverage loans were more than\noffset by a favorable mix\nshift toward interest earning\nbalances, which supported net\ninterest revenues. Citi retail\nservices revenues of $1.4\nbillion decreased 13%,\nreflecting higher partner\npayments and lower average\nloans. Retail banking revenues\nof $1.1 billion decreased 3%,\nas the benefit of stronger\ndeposit volumes and\nimprovement in mortgage\nrevenues were more than offset\nby lower deposit spreads.\n\nNorth America GCB average\ndeposits of $173 billion\nincreased 14% year-over-year,\naverage retail banking loans\nof $52 billion increased 9%\nyear-over-year and assets\nunder management of $69\nbillion increased 2%. Average\nCiti-branded card loans of $83\nbillion decreased 7% and Citi-\nbranded card purchase sales of\n$74 billion decreased 21%,\nboth driven by reduced\ncustomer activity related to\nthe pandemic. Average Citi\nretail services loans of $46\nbillion decreased 6% and Citi\nretail services purchase sales\nof $17 billion decreased 25%,\nboth driven by reduced\ncustomer activity and partner\nstore closures related to the\npandemic.

In the\nsecond quarter of 2020,\napproximately 45% of credit\ncard customers made at least\none payment during the time\nthey were enrolled in the\nprograms. In addition, Citi\nobserved re-enrollment rates\nof 14% under these programs.\nAs these credit card relief\nprograms offered a deferral of\nminimum payments for two\npayment cycles, certain\ncustomers were able to\ncomplete the program before\nJune 30, 2020. End-of-period\nloan balances for active\nenrolled customers as of June\n30, 2020, were approximately\n$2.6 billion.\n\nIn Asia, auto-enrollment\nrelief programs mandated by\ngovernments or regulators in\nMalaysia, Philippines and\nIndia programs represented the\nlargest volume of enrollments\nand\n\nloan balances. These programs\naccounted for approximately\n67% of total enrollments\nduring the second quarter.\n\nApproximately 43% of credit\ncards, personal installment\nloans and mortgage customers\nmade at least one payment\nduring the time they were\nenrolled in the programs.\n\nIn Mexico, Citi participated\nin a government-sponsored debt\nrelief program that was\navailable until May 15, 2020.\nThe program provided customers\nwith a payment deferral for\nprincipal and interest for a\nperiod of four to six months\non various products. Eligible\ncustomers included those who\nwere current (less than 30\ndays past due) as of February\n28, 2020, and given there was\nno proof of hardship required\nto apply for the program the\napplication process was made\nfrictionless. As a result,\nmost major banks experienced\nhigh enrollment rates\nassociated with the program.\nSpecifically, during the\nsecond quarter Citi received a\nlarge number of applications\nand associated enrollment\nbalances that represented\napproximately 22% of Citi`s\nconsumer lending portfolio in\nMexico. Customer payment\nbehavior under the program was\nlargely\n                               7                                \ndriven by product type.\nApproximately 57% of customers\nenrolled in credit card\nprograms made at least one\npayment during the month of\nJune 2020. Citi Corporate Loan\nRelief Programs Citi has\nmodified the contractual terms\nof corporate loans to certain\nborrowers impacted by the\npandemic. These modifications\nconsist primarily of deferrals\nin the payment of principal\nand/or interest that Citi has\nprovided during the second\nquarter of 2020 in response to\nborrower requests, as well as\nthose provided pursuant to\ngovernment-mandated relief\nprograms.

Among other\nthings, the protocols address the prioritization of critical\nprocessing; ability of staff and third parties to support these\nprocesses from remote work locations; deployment of new hardware\nto support technology needs; and ongoing monitoring to assess\ncontrols and service levels. For additional information about\nCiti\u2019s management of pandemic-related risks, see Citi\u2019s First\nQuarter of 2020 Form 10-Q. Citi expects that overall revenues in\nthe near term, including GCB and ICG revenues, will likely\ncontinue to be adversely impacted by the lower interest rate\nenvironment as well as challenging macroeconomic and market\nconditions, including the effects related to the severity and\nduration of the pandemic as well as the responses of\ngovernments, customers and clients. In particular, each GCB\nregion should continue to experience the adverse impacts from\nthe pandemic on customer behavior, including lower purchase\nsales and loan volumes, while Latin America GCB is also likely\nto experience a more pronounced impact from macroeconomic\nweakness in Mexico. Citi also expects that ICG Markets and\ninvestment banking revenues should continue to reflect overall\nmarket conditions, including a normalization of business trends\ncompared to the first half of 2020. Citi\u2019s operating expenses\nmay be impacted by uncertainties related to the pandemic,\nincluding, among other things, the continued efforts to protect\nand support Citigroup\u2019s employees and to support Citi\u2019s\ncustomers and clients digitally. Moreover, Citi, including GCB\nand ICG , expects to experience higher net credit losses on its\nexisting portfolios going forward due to the pandemic. If Citi\u2019s\nsecond quarter 2020 macro-economic forecast assumptions are\nrealized, Citi does not expect significant additional reserve\nbuilds in the near term; however the overall level of reserves\nremains dependent on the evolving economic environment relative\nto\n\nthis forecast, with a deterioration potentially having a\nsignificant impact on the movement of the ACL going forward.

Balance Sheet and Other\nItems Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Balance Sheet Trends As\nof June 30, 2020, Citi\u2019s end-of-period balance sheet grew 12%\nfrom the prior-year period (14% excluding the impact of FX\ntranslation) and 1% sequentially (largely unchanged excluding\nthe impact of FX translation), as it continued to support both\nits consumer and institutional clients.

Accordingly,\nthe FRB is requiring each\nfirm, including Citi, to\nupdate and resubmit its\ncapital plan within 45 days\nafter the FRB provides updated\nscenarios. The FRB also\nestablished temporary\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions during the third\nquarter of 2020, which may be\nextended by the FRB. Citi\ndeclared common dividends of\n$0.51 per share\n                               9                                \nfor the third quarter of 2020\non July 23, 2020, which would\nnot be impacted by the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s temporary\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions. For additional\ninformation about the capital\nplan resubmission and related\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d below.\n\nCertain Key Government Actions\nin Support of the Economy\n                                                                \n  U.S. Government-Sponsored Liquidity Programs                  \n                                                                \nDuring the first quarter of\n2020, the FRB introduced\nseveral liquidity facilities\nin response to the funding\nmarket volatility caused by\nthe pandemic. Citi has\nparticipated in several of the\nU.S. government-sponsored\nliquidity programs, including\nthe Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility (MMLF), the\nPrimary Dealer Credit Facility\n(PDCF) and Discount Window\n(DW) in order to facilitate\nclient activity and support\nthe FRB actions to provide\nadditional liquidity into the\nmarket. Citi has also\nparticipated in the Paycheck\nProtection Program Lending\nFacility (PPPLF), which was\nestablished to facilitate\nlending under the SBA\u2019s\nPaycheck Protection Program\n(see \u201cSmall Business\nAdministration\u2019s Paycheck\nProtection Program\u201d below).\nThe amounts Citi sourced from\nthese facilities were not\nsignificant to Citi\u2019s overall\nliquidity profile during the\nsecond quarter, which remains\nstrong and highly liquid.

Citi\u2019s\nreported Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio at June 30,\n2020, reflecting the modified\nCECL transition provision, was\n44 basis points higher than\nCiti\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, reflecting the\nfull impact of CECL on\nregulatory capital.\n\n\u2022 Temporary Supplementary\nLeverage ratio (SLR) relief\nfor bank holding companies,\ncommencing in the second\nquarter of 2020, allowing\nCitigroup to temporarily\nexpand its balance sheet by\nexcluding U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits with\nthe FRB from the SLR\ndenominator. Citigroup\u2019s\nreported Supplementary\nLeverage ratio of 6.66%\nbenefited 94 basis points\nduring the second quarter of\n2020 as a result of the\ntemporary relief. Excluding\nthe temporary relief,\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio would have been\n5.72%, compared with a 5.0%\neffective minimum requirement.\n\n\u2022 Assigning a 0% risk weight\nto loans originated under the\n\nPaycheck Protection Program.\n\nFor additional information\nabout regulatory capital\nrelief provided by the U.S.\nbanking agencies, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR) Relief                      \n                                                                \nUnder U.S. GAAP, banks are\nrequired to assess\nmodifications to a loan\u2019s\nterms for potential\nclassification as a TDR. A\nloan to a borrower\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty is classified as a\nTDR when a lender grants a\nconcession that it would\notherwise not consider, such\nas a payment deferral or\ninterest concession. In order\nto encourage banks to work\nwith impacted borrowers, the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act (CARES\nAct) and U.S. banking agencies\nhave provided relief from TDR\naccounting. The main benefits\nof TDR relief include a\ncapital benefit in the form of\nreduced risk-weighted assets,\nas TDRs are more heavily risk-\nweighted for capital purposes;\naging of the loans is frozen,\ni.e., they will continue to be\nreported in the same\ndelinquency bucket they were\nin at the time of\nmodification; and the loans\nare generally not reported as\nnon-accrual during the\nmodification period. The loans\nincluded in the modification\nprograms are included in\nCiti\u2019s reserving process under\nthe CECL standard.\n\nSmall Business\nAdministration\u2019s Paycheck\nProtection Program\n\nThe Paycheck Protection\nProgram (the Program)\nauthorizes the origination of\nforgivable loans to small\nbusinesses to pay their\nemployees during the pandemic.\nLoan terms are the same for\nall businesses. Among other\nprograms, Citi is\nparticipating in the Payment\nProtection Program and has\nfunded approximately $3.8\nbillion in loans as of June\n30, 2020. Citi remains\ncommitted to supporting small\nbusinesses. The processing of\nloan forgiveness requests\nunder the Program is expected\nto begin in the third quarter\nof 2020 and the timing for\nprocessing will determine\nwhether there is significant\nforgiveness in the second half\nof 2020.\n                               10                               \n                                                                \n  RISK FACTORS                                                  \n                                                                \nMacroeconomic and Other\nChallenges and Uncertainties\nRelated to the COVID-19\nPandemic Will Likely Continue\nto Have Negative Impacts on\nCiti\u2019s Businesses and Results\nof Operations and Financial\nCondition.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has\nspread globally, affecting all\nof the countries and\njurisdictions where Citi\noperates. The pandemic has\nhad, and will likely continue\nto have, negative impacts on\nCiti\u2019s businesses, revenues,\nexpenses, credit costs and\noverall results of operations\nand financial condition, which\ncould be material. The\npandemic and responses to it\nhave had, and will likely\ncontinue to have, a severe\nimpact on global economic\nconditions, although the\nimpacts will likely vary from\ntime to time by country, state\nor region, largely depending\nupon the duration and severity\nof the public health\nconsequences and availability\nof any effective therapeutic\nor vaccine. These impacts to\nglobal economic conditions\ninclude, among others:\n\n\u2022 sharply reduced U.S. and\nglobal economic output and\nemployment, resulting in loss\nof employment and lower\nconsumer spending, cards\npurchase sales and loan\nvolumes;\n\n\u2022 disruption of global supply\nchains;\n\n\u2022 significant disruption and\nvolatility in financial\nmarkets;\n\n\u2022 temporary closures, reduced\nactivity and failures of many\nbusinesses, leading to loss of\nrevenues and net losses; and\n\n\u2022 the institution of social\ndistancing and restrictions on\nmovement in and among the\nUnited States and other\ncountries.\n\nThe extent of the pandemic\u2019s\nimpact on Citi\u2019s financial\nperformance and operations,\nincluding its ability to\nexecute its business\ninitiatives and strategies,\nwill continue to depend on\nfuture developments in the\nU.S. and globally, which are\nuncertain and cannot be\npredicted, including the\nduration and further spread of\nthe disease, as well as the\nseverity of the economic\ndownturn or any delay or\nweakness in the economic\nrecovery. The impact will in\npart be dependent on\ngovernment and other actions\ntaken to lessen the health and\neconomic repercussions, such\nas medical investments and\nadvances, restrictions on\nmovement of people,\ntransportation and businesses,\nand the effectiveness of past\nand any future fiscal,\nmonetary and other\ngovernmental actions. Ongoing\nlegislative and regulatory\nchanges in the U.S. and\nglobally to address the\neconomic impact from the\npandemic, such as consumer and\ncorporate relief measures,\ncould further affect Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, credit costs and\nresults. Citi could also face\nchallenges, including legal\nand reputational, and scrutiny\nin its implementation of and\nongoing efforts to provide\nthese relief measures. Such\nimplementations and efforts\nhave resulted in, and may\ncontinue to result in,\nlitigation, including class\nactions, or regulatory and\ngovernment actions and\nproceedings. Such actions may\nresult in judgments,\nsettlements, penalties and\nfines adverse to Citi. In\naddition, the different types\nof government actions could\nvary in scale and duration\nacross jurisdictions and\nregions with varying degrees\nof effectiveness.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\nborrowers will also vary by\nregion, sector or industry,\nwith some borrowers\nexperiencing greater stress\nlevels, which could lead to\nincreased pressure on the\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition of such\nborrowers, increased\nborrowings or credit ratings\ndowngrades, thus likely\nleading to higher credit\ncosts. In addition, stress\nlevels ultimately experienced\nby Citi\u2019s borrowers may be\ndifferent from and more\nintense than assumptions made\nin earlier estimates or models\nused by Citi during or prior\nto the emergence of the\npandemic, resulting in a\nfurther increase in Citi\u2019s\nallowance for credit losses or\nnet credit losses.\n\nThe pandemic may not be\nsufficiently contained for an\nextended period of time, due\nto a further emergence or re-\nemergence of widespread\ninfections. A prolonged health\ncrisis could continue to\nreduce economic activity in\nthe U.S. and other countries,\nresulting in a further decline\nin employment and business and\nconsumer confidence. These\nfactors could further\nnegatively impact global\neconomic activity and Citi\u2019s\nconsumer customers and\ncorporate clients; cause a\ncontinued decline in Citi\u2019s\nrevenues and the demand for\nits products and services;\nlead to a prolonged period of\nlower interest rates; and\nfurther increase Citi\u2019s credit\nand other costs. These factors\ncould also cause a continued\nincrease in Citi\u2019s balance\nsheet, risk-weighted assets\nand allowance for credit loss\nreserves, resulting in a\ndecline in regulatory capital\nratios or liquidity measures,\nas well as regulatory demands\nfor higher capital levels\nand/or reductions in capital\ndistributions. Moreover, any\ndisruption or failure of\nCiti\u2019s performance of, or its\nability to perform, key\nbusiness functions, as a\nresult of the continued spread\nof COVID-19 or otherwise,\ncould adversely affect Citi\u2019s\noperations.\n\nAny disruption to, breaches of\nor attacks on Citi\u2019s\ninformation technology\nsystems, including from cyber\nincidents, could have adverse\neffects on Citi\u2019s businesses.\nThese systems are supporting a\nsubstantial portion of Citi\u2019s\nemployees who have been\naffected by local pandemic\nrestrictions and have been\nforced to work remotely. In\naddition, these systems\ninterface with and depend on\nthird-party systems, and Citi\ncould experience service\ndenials or disruptions if\ndemand for such systems were\nto exceed capacity or if a\nthird-party system fails or\nexperiences any interruptions.\nCiti has also taken measures\nto maintain the health and\nsafety of its employees;\nhowever, these measures could\nresult in increased expenses,\nand widespread illness could\nnegatively affect staffing\nwithin certain functions,\nbusinesses or geographies. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s ability to\nrecruit, hire and onboard\nemployees in key areas could\nbe negatively impacted by\nglobal pandemic restrictions.\n\nFurther, it is unclear how the\nmacroeconomic business\nenvironment or societal norms\nmay be impacted after the\npandemic. The post-pandemic\nenvironment may undergo\nunexpected developments or\nchanges in financial markets,\nthe fiscal, tax and regulatory\nenvironments and consumer\ncustomer and corporate client\nbehavior. These developments\nand changes could have an\nadverse impact on Citi\u2019s\nresults of operations and\nfinancial condition. Ongoing\nbusiness and regulatory\nuncertainties and changes may\nmake Citi\u2019s longer-\n                               11                               \nterm business, balance sheet\nand budget planning more\ndifficult or costly. Citi, its\nmanagement and its businesses\nmay also experience increased\nor different competitive and\nother challenges in this\nenvironment. To the extent\nthat it is not able to adapt\nor compete effectively, Citi\ncould experience loss of\nbusiness and its results of\noperations and financial\ncondition could suffer.\n\nFor additional

Net credit losses\nincreased 5%, primarily driven\nby higher net credit losses in\nCiti-branded cards (up 10% to\n$795 million), reflecting\nseasoning in the portfolio,\nwhile Citi retail services net\ncredit losses were largely\nunchanged. The ACL build in\nthe second quarter was $1.5\nbillion, reflecting a\ndeterioration in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook,\nprimarily driven by the\npandemic, on estimated\nlifetime credit losses under\nCECL (compared to a build of\n$81 million in the prior-year\nperiod under prior accounting\nstandards), partially offset\nby the impact of a change in\naccounting for third-party\ncollection fees (see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u201d below).\n\nFor additional information on\nNorth America GCB \u2019s retail\nbanking, and its Citi-branded\ncards and Citi retail services\nportfolios, see \u201cCredit\nRisk\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nCECL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below,\nand Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to the\npandemic, see \u201cCOVID-19\nPandemic Overview\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  2020 YTD vs. 2019 YTD                                         \n                                                                \nYear-to-date, North America\nGCB experienced similar trends\nto those described above.

The ACL build\nin the second quarter was $202\nmillion, reflecting a\ndeterioration in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook,\nprimarily driven by the\npandemic, on estimated\nlifetime credit losses under\nCECL (compared to no build in\nthe prior-year period under\nprior accounting standards).\n\nFor additional information on\nLatin America GCB \u2019s retail\nbanking and its Citi-branded\ncards portfolios, see \u201cCredit\nRisk\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nCECL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below,\nand Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to the\npandemic, see \u201cCOVID-19\nPandemic Overview\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  2020 YTD vs. 2019 YTD                                         \n                                                                \nNet loss was $18 million,\ncompared to Net income of $406\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, reflecting\nsignificantly higher cost of\ncredit, lower revenues and\nhigher expenses.\n\nRevenues decreased 3%.\nExcluding the impact of a\nresidual gain (approximately\n$30 million) in the prior-year\nperiod on the sale of an asset\nmanagement business, revenues\ndecreased 2%, as lower\nrevenues in retail banking\nwere partially offset by\nhigher cards revenues.

Average\ndeposits increased 10% and\naverage loans increased 5%.\nAssets under management\ndeclined 4%, reflecting the\nimpact of market movements,\nwhile investment sales\nincreased 18%. Retail lending\nrevenues increased 8%,\nreflecting growth in both\npersonal loans and mortgages.\n\nCards revenues decreased 22%,\nprimarily driven by lower\npurchase sales (down 29%) and\nlower average loans (down 9%),\nreflecting the impact of the\npandemic on customer behavior,\nspecifically from lower travel\nspend in the region, given\nCiti\u2019s skew to an affluent\nclient base and a greater\nproportion of fee revenues\ncoming from travel-related\ninterchange and foreign\ntransaction fees.\n\nExpenses decreased 5%, as\nefficiency savings, lower\nmarketing and other\ndiscretionary expenses and\nlower volume-related costs\nmore than offset ongoing\ninvestment spending.\n\nProvisions of $456 million\nincreased $277 million from\nthe prior-year period, driven\nby a higher allowance for\ncredit losses (ACL) build as\nwell as higher net credit\nlosses. Net credit losses\nincreased 15%, as lockdowns\nand the deterioration in the\nmacro-environment impacted\ncredit performance. The ACL\nbuild in the second quarter\nwas $259 million, reflecting a\ndeterioration in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook,\nprimarily driven by the\npandemic, on estimated\nlifetime credit losses under\nCECL (compared to a build of\n$9 million in the prior-year\nperiod under prior accounting\nstandards).\n\nFor additional information on\nAsia GCB \u2019s retail banking\nportfolios and its Citi-\nbranded cards portfolios, see\n\u201cCredit Risk\u2014Consumer Credit\u201d\nbelow.\n\nFor additional information on\nCECL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below,\nand Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to the\npandemic, see \u201cCOVID-19\nPandemic Overview\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  2020 YTD vs. 2019 YTD                                         \n                                                                \nYear-to-date, Asia GCB\nexperienced similar trends to\nthose described above.

Excluding the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges, Banking revenues were\nup 4%, driven by higher\nrevenues in investment banking\nand the private bank,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in treasury and trade\nsolutions and corporate\nlending. Excluding the pretax\ngain of approximately $350\nmillion on Citi\u2019s investment\nin Tradeweb in the prior-year\nperiod, Markets and securities\nservices revenues were up 60%,\nreflecting significantly\nhigher revenues in fixed\nincome markets, driven by\nincreased client activity due\nto higher market volatility,\nprimarily related to the\nimpact of the COVID-19\npandemic, partially offset by\nlower revenues in equity\nmarkets and securities\nservices.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nwere up 37%, as growth in debt\nand equity underwriting\nrevenues was partially offset\nby modestly lower advisory\nrevenues. The increase in\nrevenues outperformed the\noverall growth in the market\nwallet. Advisory revenues\ndecreased 1%, largely\nreflecting a decline in the\nmarket wallet. Equity\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased 56%, reflecting\nparticular strength in North\nAmerica and Asia , driven by\nan increase in the market\nwallet as well as share gains.\nDebt underwriting revenues\nincreased 41%, with strength\nacross all regions. The\nincrease was driven by an\nincrease in market wallet as\nwell as share gains, including\na 131% increase in investment-\ngrade debt underwriting, as\nthe business continued to\nassist clients with sourcing\nliquidity in the evolving\nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 11%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, revenues\ndecreased 7%, reflecting a\ndecline in both the cash and\ntrade businesses. The decline\nin revenues in the cash\nbusiness reflected the\ncontinued impact of lower\ninterest rates and a slowdown\nin commercial cards spend\ndriven by the impact of the\npandemic, partially offset by\nstrong deposit volumes.\nAverage deposit balances\nincreased 28% (30% excluding\nthe impact of FX translation),\nreflecting strong client\nengagement and solid growth\nacross all regions. In trade,\nrevenues were impacted by a\ndecline in\n\ntrade fees, reflecting an\noverall economic slowdown\nrelated to the pandemic,\npartially offset by improved\ntrade spreads.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\ndecreased $418 million to $232\nmillion, reflecting higher\nlosses on loan hedges, as\ncredit spreads tightened\nduring the quarter. Excluding\nthe impact of losses on loan\nhedges, revenues decreased\n11%, as lower loan spreads\nmore than offset the impact of\nhigher loan volumes, as the\nbusiness assisted clients with\nsourcing liquidity in the\nevolving environment.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 8%. Excluding the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges, revenues increased\n10%, reflecting continued\nstrength across all regions.\nThe increase reflected strong\nclient activity, which drove\nhigher capital markets\nrevenues and higher loan and\ndeposit volumes, partially\noffset by lower deposit\nspreads due to the lower\ninterest rate environment.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 68%.\nExcluding the Tradeweb gain in\nthe prior-year period,\nrevenues increased 89%,\nreflecting higher revenues\nacross all regions, as well as\nstrong performance across both\nrates and currencies and\nspread products, due to the\nimpact of market conditions,\nincluding elevated volatility,\nrelated to the pandemic. Non-\ninterest revenues increased,\nreflecting higher corporate\nand investor client activity,\nas volatility, volumes and\nspreads remained elevated,\nparticularly in rates and\ncurrencies and commodities.\nNet interest revenues also\nincreased, reflecting lower\nfunding costs as well as a\nchange in the mix of trading\npositions in support of client\nactivity.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\nincreased 69%, primarily\ndriven by higher G10 rates\nrevenues, as Citi assisted\ncorporate and investor clients\nin repositioning their\nportfolios in a challenging\nmarket environment related to\nthe impact of the pandemic,\nincluding elevated levels of\nvolatility. Spread products\nand other fixed income\nrevenues increased 67%. The\nincrease was driven by higher\nrevenues in commodities,\nreflecting increased\nvolatility related to the\nimpact of the pandemic, higher\nrevenues in flow trading,\nreflecting higher client\ndemand, and a more favorable\nmarket making environment, as\nevidenced by spread\ntightening. The increase was\npartially offset by lower\nsecuritization revenues,\nreflecting a more challenging\nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\ndecreased 3%, as higher cash\nequities revenues across all\nregions were more than offset\n                               28                               \nby lower equity derivatives\nand prime finance revenues.\nThe decline in equity\nderivatives revenues reflected\na more challenging\nenvironment, as volatility\ndeclined, particularly in EMEA\n. The decline was partially\noffset by strong client\nactivity, as clients continued\nto rebalance and hedge\npositions. The decline in\nprime finance revenues\nprimarily reflected lower\nfinancing balances,\nparticularly in North America\nand EMEA .\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\ndecreased 9%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues decreased 5%, as\nhigher deposit volumes were\nmore than offset by lower\ndeposit spreads as interest\nrates declined.\n\nFor additional information on\ntrends in ICG \u2019s deposit and\ntrade loans, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Liquidity\nRisk\u2014Loans\u201d and \u201c\u2014Deposits\u201d\nbelow.\n\nExpenses were up 7%,\nreflecting higher compensation\ncosts, continued investments\nand volume-driven growth,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nProvisions increased to $3.9\nbillion, primarily reflecting\na higher ACL build as well as\nhigher net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses were $324\nmillion, compared to $91\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by\nwrite-offs across various\nsectors in both North America\nand EMEA , primarily\nreflecting smaller-sized\nenergy and energy-related\nexposures.\n\nThe ACL build was $3.5\nbillion, compared to $41\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod under prior accounting\nstandards. The increase\nreflected the impact of a\ndeterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook under\nthe CECL standard, driven by\nthe impact of the pandemic\nacross multiple sectors, as\nwell as downgrades in the\nportfolio. Sectors\nsignificantly impacted by the\npandemic (including energy and\nenergy-related, aviation,\nconsumer retail, commercial\nreal estate and autos) drove\napproximately half of the ACL\nreserve build during the\nquarter. The ACL build also\nincluded an increase in the\nqualitative management\nadjustment component of the\nreserve to reflect the\npotential for a higher level\nof stress and/or somewhat\nslower economic recovery. This\nmanagement adjustment\ncomplements the primary\nforward-looking macroeconomic\nscenario used to estimate the\ncredit reserve requirement.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, reserves\nheld on Citi\u2019s balance sheet\nrepresented 1.71% of funded\nloans, compared to 0.80% as of\nMarch 31, 2020, including 4.9%\nof reserves held against the\nnon-investment grade portion,\ncompared to 2.1% as of March\n31, 2020.\n\nFor additional information on\nICG \u2019s corporate credit\nportfolio, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Credit\nRisk\u2014Corporate Credit\u201d below.\n\nFor additional information on\nCECL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u201d below,\nand Notes 1, 13 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor additional information\nabout trends, uncertainties\nand risks related to the\npandemic, see \u201cCOVID-19\nPandemic Overview\u201d and \u201cRisk\nFactors\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  2020 YTD vs. 2019 YTD                                         \n                                                                \nNet income decreased 19%, as\nsignificantly higher cost of\ncredit and higher expenses\nwere partially offset by\nhigher revenues.\n\nRevenues were up 23%, driven\nby a 43% increase in Markets\nand securities services as\nwell as a 5% increase in\nBanking revenues (including\nthe impact of gains (losses)\non loan hedges). Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, Banking revenues\ndeclined 1%, as growth in\ninvestment banking and the\nprivate bank was more than\noffset by a decrease in\ntreasury and trade solutions\nand corporate lending.\nExcluding the Tradeweb gain in\nthe prior-year period, Markets\nand securities services\nrevenues increased 48%,\nprimarily driven by growth in\nboth fixed income markets and\nequity markets revenues,\npartially offset by a decline\nin securities services.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nincreased 18%. Advisory\nrevenues increased 1%,\nreflecting gains in wallet\nshare despite a decline in the\noverall market wallet. Equity\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased 38%, primarily\nreflecting growth in the\nmarket wallet. Debt\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased 19%, reflecting\nmarket wallet growth and gains\nin share.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 8%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, revenues\ndecreased 5%, reflecting lower\nrevenues in both cash and\ntrade, driven by the same\nfactors described above.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nincreased 23%, reflecting\ngains on loan hedges as credit\nspreads widened. Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, revenues\ndecreased 26%, primarily\ndriven by an adjustment to the\nresidual value of a lease\nfinancing asset and lower loan\nspreads, partially offset by\nhigher loan volumes.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 12%. Excluding the\nimpact of gains on loan hedges\nin the current period,\nrevenues increased 9%,\nreflecting strength across all\nregions, driven by the same\nfactors described above.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues increased 53%,\nprimarily reflecting higher\nrevenues in North America ,\nAsia and EMEA . Rates and\ncurrencies revenues increased\n68%, driven by the same\nfactors described above.\nSpread products and other\nfixed income revenues\nincreased 23%, driven by the\nsame factors described above.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 19%, driven by\nhigher revenues in North\nAmerica and Asia , reflecting\nhigher revenues in both cash\nequities and equity\nderivatives revenues,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in prime finance.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\ndeclined 4%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues were largely\nunchanged, as higher client\nactivity and deposit volumes\nwere offset by lower interest\nrevenues as interest rates\ndeclined.\n                               29                               \nExpenses were up 5%,\nreflecting higher compensation\ncosts, continued investments\nand volume-driven growth,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nProvisions increased to $5.9\nbillion, driven by net credit\nlosses of $451 million,\ncompared to $169 million in\nthe prior-year period, and an\nACL build of $5.4 billion\ncompared to a minimal release\nin the prior-year period. The\nincrease in net credit losses\nwas driven by the same factors\ndescribed above.\n\nThe increase in the ACL build\nprimarily reflected the impact\nof deterioration in the\nmacroeconomic outlook, driven\nby the pandemic across\nmultiple sectors under the\nCECL standard, as well as\ndowngrades in the portfolio\nand the qualitative management\nadjustment.\n                               30                               \n                                                                \n  CORPORATE/OTHER                                               \n                                                                \nCorporate/Other includes certain unallocated costs of global\nstaff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal\nand compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global\noperations and technology expenses and income taxes, as well as\nCorporate Treasury, certain North America legacy consumer loan\nportfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for\nadditional information on Corporate/Other , see \u201cCitigroup\nSegments\u201d above).

Citi\u2019s reportable\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nratio was 11.8% under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach as of December 31,\n2019. Citi\u2019s Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital ratio increased\nfrom March 31, 2020, largely\ndriven by lower credit risk-\nweighted assets, beneficial\nnet movements in Accumulated\nother comprehensive income\n(AOCI) , net income of $1.3\nbillion and the relief\nprovided by the modified CECL\ntransition provision for the\nquarter, partially offset by\nthe return of $1.1 billion of\ncapital to common\nshareholders.\n\nCiti\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio declined from\nyear-end 2019, primarily due\nto a net increase in risk-\nweighted assets, the return of\n$5.1 billion of capital to\ncommon shareholders, partially\noffset by year-to-date net\nincome of $3.8 billion and the\nrelief of the modified CECL\ntransition provision.\n\nRegulatory Capital Relief\nResulting from the COVID-19\nPandemic\n\nThe U.S. banking agencies\nissued several interim final\nrules during the second\nquarter of 2020 to revise the\ncurrent regulatory capital\nstandards applicable to Citi,\nin light of the pandemic. For\nadditional information\nregarding interim final rules\nissued during the first\nquarter of 2020, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d in Citi\u2019s First\nQuarter of 2020 Form 10-Q.\n                                                                \n  Temporary Supplementary Leverage Ratio Relief                 \n                                                                \nIn April 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board issued an\ninterim final rule that\ntemporarily changes the\ncalculation of the\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nfor bank holding companies,\nincluding Citigroup, by\nexcluding U.S. Treasuries and\ndeposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks from Total Leverage\nExposure. Repo-style\ntransactions on U.S.\nTreasuries are not in scope\nfor this relief. The\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nis a non-risk-sensitive\nmeasure, and the temporary\nexclusion allows banking\norganizations to expand their\nbalance sheet, as appropriate,\nto continue to serve as\nfinancial intermediaries and\nto provide credit to\nhouseholds and businesses\nduring the pandemic. The\ninterim final rule is\neffective for Citigroup\u2019s\n\nSupplementary Leverage ratio,\nas well as for Citigroup\u2019s\nleverage-based Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) and\nLong-Term Debt (LTD)\nrequirements, beginning with\nthe quarter ended June 30,\n2020, and will continue\nthrough March 31, 2021.\nCitigroup\u2019s reported\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nof 6.66% benefited 94 basis\npoints during the second\nquarter of 2020 as a result of\nthe temporary relief.\nExcluding the temporary\nrelief, Citigroup\u2019s\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nwould have been 5.72%,\ncompared with a 5.0% effective\nminimum requirement.\n\nIn June 2020, the U.S. banking\nagencies issued an interim\nfinal rule that permits\ndepository institutions,\nincluding Citibank, to elect\nto temporarily exclude U.S.\nTreasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks from\nTotal Leverage Exposure,\nsubject to the condition that\nthe depository institution\nmust receive approval from its\nprimary federal banking\nregulator prior to paying\ndividends or making certain\nother capital distributions\nwhile the exclusion is in\neffect. Citibank did not elect\nto temporarily exclude U.S.\nTreasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks from\nTotal Leverage Exposure.\nAccordingly, the calculation\nmethodology of Citibank\u2019s\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nwas unchanged.\n\nRegulatory Capital Impact of\nthe Paycheck Protection\nProgram\n\nIn April 2020, as part of the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act (CARES\nAct) and in recognition of the\nexigent circumstances faced by\nsmall businesses, Congress\ncreated the Paycheck\nProtection Program (PPP). PPP\ncovered loans are fully\nguaranteed as to principal and\naccrued interest by the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA).\nAs a general matter, SBA\nguarantees are backed by the\nfull faith and credit of the\nU.S. government.\n\nIn order to provide liquidity\nto small business lenders and\nthe broader credit markets,\nand to help stabilize the\nfinancial system, the Federal\nReserve Board authorized each\nof the Federal Reserve Banks\nto extend credit under the\nPaycheck Protection Program\nLending Facility (PPPLF).\nUnder the PPPLF, the Federal\nReserve Banks may extend non-\nrecourse loans to institutions\nthat are eligible to originate\nPPP\n\ncovered loans, such as\nCitibank, with PPP loans that\nare originated or purchased by\nthe institution pledged to the\nFederal Reserve as collateral\nto secure the PPPLF extensions\nof credit. The PPPLF began\nextending credit in April\n2020, and will not extend new\ncredit after September 30,\n2020, unless the PPPLF is\nextended by the Federal\nReserve Board and the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury.\n\nIn April 2020, in recognition\nof CARES Act requirements, and\nto facilitate the use of the\nPPPLF, the U.S. banking\nagencies issued an interim\nfinal rule that allows banking\norganizations to neutralize\ncertain regulatory capital\neffects of PPP loans. The\ninterim final rule states that\nPPP covered loans originated\nby a banking organization\nunder the PPP will be risk-\nweighted at 0% under the\nStandardized Approach and the\nAdvanced Approaches.\nAdditionally, the interim\nfinal rule permits banking\norganizations to exclude\nexposures pledged as\ncollateral to the PPPLF from\nquarterly adjusted average\ntotal assets and Total\nLeverage Exposure.\n                               33                               \nThe interim final rule was\neffective commencing with the\nquarter ended June 30, 2020.\n

capital\nrequirements include the 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nand the 3.0% GSIB surcharge\n(all of which must be composed\nof Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital).\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply\nthe modified transition\nprovision related to the\nimpact of the CECL accounting\nstandard on regulatory\ncapital, as provided by the\nU.S. banking agencies\u2019 March\n2020 interim final rule. Under\nthe modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in\nretained earnings (after-tax),\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs)\narising from temporary\ndifferences, and the allowance\nfor credit losses upon the\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL adoption\ndate have been deferred and\nwill phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022.\nFor the ongoing impact of\nCECL, Citigroup is allowed to\nadjust retained earnings and\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses in an amount equal to\n25% of the change in the\nallowance for credit losses\nrecognized through earnings\n(pre-tax) for each period\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The\ncumulative adjustments to\nretained earnings and the\nallowance for credit losses\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital\nat 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related\nto the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding\nadjustments to average on-\nbalance sheet assets are\nreflected in quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nand Total Leverage Exposure.\nAdditionally, the increase in\nDTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences upon the January\n1, 2020 adoption date has been\ndeducted from risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and will phase in\nto RWA at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022.\n\n(3) Commencing with the\nquarter ended March 31, 2020,\nexposures acquired pursuant to\na non-recourse loan as part of\nthe Money Market Mutual Fund\nLiquidity Facility are\nexcluded from risk-weighted\nassets under the Advanced\nApproaches and Standardized\nApproach, as well as quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nand Total Leverage Exposure.\n\n(4) Commencing with the\nquarter ended June 30, 2020,\nloans originated under the\nPaycheck Protection Program\nreceive a 0% risk weight under\nthe Advanced Approaches and\nStandardized Approach.\n\n(5) Citi\u2019s reportable Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital and Tier\n1 Capital ratios were derived\nunder the Basel III Advanced\nApproaches framework as of\nJune 30, 2020 and March 31,\n2020, and the Basel III\nStandardized Approach as of\nDecember 31, 2019, whereas\nCiti\u2019s reportable Total\nCapital ratio was the lower\nderived under the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches framework\nfor all periods presented.\n\n(6) Commencing with the\nquarter ended June 30, 2020,\nexposures pledged as\ncollateral pursuant to a non-\nrecourse loan that is provided\nas part of the Paycheck\nProtection Program Lending\nFacility are excluded from\nquarterly adjusted average\ntotal assets and Total\nLeverage Exposure.\n\n(7) Tier 1 Leverage ratio\ndenominator.

Commencing\nwith the second quarter of\n2020, Citigroup\u2019s Total\nLeverage Exposure temporarily\nexcludes U.S. Treasuries and\ndeposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks.\n\nAs indicated in the table\nabove, Citigroup\u2019s risk-based\ncapital ratios at June 30,\n2020 were in excess of the\nstated and effective minimum\nrequirements under the U.S.\nBasel III rules. In addition,\nCiti was also \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under current\nfederal bank regulatory agency\ndefinitions as of June 30,\n2020.\n                               34

Issuance costs of $151 million as of June 30, 2020 and $152\nmillion as of December 31, 2019 are related to outstanding\nnoncumulative perpetual preferred stock, are excluded from\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity and are netted against such\npreferred stock in accordance with Federal Reserve Board\nregulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under\nU.S. GAAP.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision\nrelated to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on\nregulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nMarch 2020 interim final rule. Under the modified CECL\ntransition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-\ntax) and the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1,\n2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\nFor the ongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust\nretained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an\namount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit\nlosses recognized through earnings (pre-tax) for each period\nbetween January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative\nadjustments to retained earnings and the allowance for credit\nlosses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts related to the\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.\n\n(3) Includes goodwill \u201cembedded\u201d in the valuation of significant\ncommon stock investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions.\n           Footnotes continue on the following page.            \n                                                                \n                               35                               \n(4) Of Citi\u2019s $23.9 billion of net DTAs at June 30, 2020, $14.2\nbillion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant\nto the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.7 billion was excluded.\nExcluded from Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of June 30,\n2020 was $12.3 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating\nloss, foreign tax credit and general business credit carry-\nforwards, which was reduced by $2.6 billion of net DTLs\nprimarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible\nassets. Separately, under the U.S. Basel III rules, goodwill and\nthese other intangible assets are deducted net of associated\nDTLs in arriving at Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. DTAs arising\nfrom net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business\ncredit carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\nCiti\u2019s DTAs arising from temporary differences are less than the\n10% limitation under the U.S. Basel III rules and therefore not\nsubject to deduction from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but are\nsubject to risk weighting at 250%.\n\n(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the\nVolcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting\ncertain proprietary investment activities and limits their\nownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. The U.S.\nagencies issued a revised Volcker Rule 2.0 in November 2019 that\nremoves permitted investments in third-party covered funds from\ncapital deduction requirements, among other changes. Upon the\nremoval of the capital deduction, permitted investments in\nthird-party covered funds will be included in risk-weighted\nassets. Mandatory compliance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0\nis required by January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted,\nin whole or in part, beginning January 1, 2020. Additionally,\nthe U.S. agencies released a revised Volcker Rule 2.1 in June\n2020 that improves and streamlines several \u201ccovered funds\u201d\nrequirements, with an effective date of October 1, 2020. Citi\ncontinues to deduct from Tier 1 Capital all permitted ownership\ninterests in covered funds for all periods presented.\n\n(7) 50% of the minimum regulatory capital requirements of\ninsurance underwriting subsidiaries must be deducted from each\nof Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.\n\n(8) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the\nU.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased-out of Tier 2\nCapital by January 1, 2022.\n\n(9) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach, in which the\nallowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any\nexcess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at\ncredit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of allowance for\ncredit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital, subject to limitation, under the Standardized Approach\nframework was $13.8 billion and $13.9 billion at June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019, respectively.\n                               36                               \n                                                                \n

provided by the\nU.S. banking agencies\u2019 March\n2020 interim final rule. Under\nthe modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in DTAs\narising from temporary\ndifferences and the allowance\nfor credit losses upon the\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL adoption\ndate have been deferred and\nwill phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022.\nFor the ongoing impact of\nCECL, Citigroup is allowed to\nadjust the allowance for\ncredit losses in an amount\nequal to 25% of the change in\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses recognized through\nearnings (pre-tax) for each\nperiod between January 1, 2020\nand December 31, 2021.

Corresponding\nadjustments to average on-\nbalance sheet assets are\nreflected in Total Leverage\nExposure.\n\n(3) Commencing with the second\nquarter of 2020, Citigroup\u2019s\nTotal Leverage Exposure\ntemporarily excludes U.S.\nTreasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks.\n\n(4) Represents the average of\ncertain off-balance sheet\nexposures calculated as of the\nlast day of each month in the\nquarter.\n\n(5) Under the U.S. Basel III\nrules, banking organizations\nare required to include in\nTotal Leverage Exposure the\neffective notional amount of\nsold credit derivatives, with\nnetting of exposures permitted\nif certain conditions are met.\n\n(6) Repo-style transactions\ninclude repurchase and reverse\nrepurchase transactions as\nwell as securities borrowing\nand securities lending\ntransactions.\n\nAs set forth in the table\nabove, Citigroup\u2019s\nSupplementary Leverage ratio\nwas 6.7% for the second\nquarter of 2020, compared to\n6.0% for the first quarter of\n2020, and 6.2% for the fourth\nquarter of 2019. The ratio\nincreased from the first\nquarter of 2020 and the fourth\nquarter of 2019, primarily\nattributable to the 94 basis\npoint benefit resulting from\nthe Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\ntemporary

capital requirements\ninclude the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of which must\nbe composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital).\n\n(2) Citibank has elected to apply the modified transition\nprovision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard\non regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nMarch 2020 interim final rule. Under the modified CECL\ntransition provision, the changes in retained earnings (after-\ntax), deferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary\ndifferences, and the allowance for credit losses upon the\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL adoption date have been deferred and will\nphase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank is\nallowed to adjust retained earnings and the allowance for credit\nlosses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance\nfor credit losses recognized through earnings (pre-tax) for each\nperiod between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The\ncumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the allowance\nfor credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021\nwill also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts\nrelated to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date. Corresponding\nadjustments to average on-balance sheet assets are reflected in\nquarterly adjusted average total assets and Total Leverage\nExposure. Additionally, the increase in DTAs arising from\ntemporary differences upon the January 1, 2020 adoption date has\nbeen deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA) and will phase in\nto RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\n\n(3) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach in which the\nallowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any\nexcess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at\ncredit risk-weighted assets.\n\n(4) Commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2020, loans\noriginated under the Paycheck Protection Program receive a 0%\nrisk weight under the Advanced Approaches and Standardized\nApproach.\n\n(5) Citibank\u2019s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of June 30, 2020\nand March 31, 2020, and the Basel III Standardized Approach as\nof December 31, 2019, whereas Citibank\u2019s reportable Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower\nderived under the Basel III Standardized Approach framework for\nall periods presented.\n\n(6) Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of\n6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nregulations applicable to insured depository institutions as\nestablished by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also\nmaintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d For additional information, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Current Regulatory Capital Standards\u2014Prompt\nCorrective Action Framework\u201d in Citigroup\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\n(7) Commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2020, exposures\npledged as collateral pursuant to a non-recourse loan that is\nprovided as part of the Paycheck Protection Program Lending\nFacility are excluded from quarterly adjusted average total\nassets and Total Leverage Exposure.\n\n(8) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly\naverage total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n\n(9) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Citibank\u2019s Total\nLeverage Exposure includes U.S. Treasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks for all periods.\n                               41                               \nAs indicated in the table\nabove, Citibank\u2019s capital\nratios at June 30, 2020 were\nin excess of the stated and\neffective minimum requirements\nunder the U.S. Basel III\nrules. In addition, Citibank\nwas also \u201cwell capitalized\u201d as\nof June 30, 2020.\n\nImpact of Changes on Citigroup\nand Citibank Capital Ratios\n\nThe following tables present\nthe estimated sensitivity of\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncapital ratios to changes of\n$100 million in Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital\nand Total Capital (numerator),\nand changes of $1 billion in\n\nAdvanced Approaches and\nStandardized Approach risk-\nweighted assets and quarterly\nadjusted average total assets,\nas well as Total Leverage\nExposure (denominator), as of\nJune 30, 2020.

Based on the\ninterim SCB, beginning October\n1, 2020, Citigroup will be\nrequired to maintain a 10.0%\neffective minimum Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, unchanged from\nCitigroup\u2019s current effective\nminimum Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio under the\nStandardized Approach.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s SCB is based on\nthe Federal Reserve Board\u2019s\nMarch 2020 SCB final rule,\nwhich integrates the annual\nstress testing requirements\nwith ongoing regulatory\ncapital requirements. For\nCitigroup, the SCB rule\nreplaces the fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nunder the Standardized\nApproach, and equals the peak-\nto-trough Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio decline under\nthe Supervisory Severely\nAdverse scenario used in the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis\nand Review (CCAR) and Dodd-\nFrank Act Stress Testing\n(DFAST), plus four quarters of\nplanned common stock\ndividends, subject to a floor\nof 2.5%. The fixed 2.5%\nCapital Conservation Buffer\nwill continue to apply under\nthe Advanced Approaches. SCB-\nbased minimum capital\nrequirements will be updated\nat least once per year as part\nof the CCAR process. Similar\nto the current Capital\nConservation Buffer, a breach\nof the SCB will result in\ngraduated limitations on\ncapital distributions. For\nadditional information\nregarding the SCB final rule,\nsee \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nStandards Developments\u2014Stress\nCapital Buffer\u201d in Citi\u2019s\nFirst Quarter 2020 Form 10-Q.\nFor additional information\nregarding CCAR and DFAST, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Current\nRegulatory Capital\nStandards\u2014Stress Testing\nComponent of Capital Planning\u201d\nin Citi\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\nThe SCB applies to Citigroup\nonly. The regulatory capital\nframework applicable to\nCitibank, including the\nCapital Conservation Buffer,\nis unchanged by Citigroup\u2019s\nSCB.\n\nCapital Plan Resubmission and\nRelated Limitations on Capital\nDistributions\n\nIn June 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board determined that\nchanges in financial markets\nand macroeconomic outlooks\nrelated to the COVID-19\npandemic could have a material\neffect on the risk profile and\nfinancial condition of each\nfirm subject to its capital\nplan rule and, therefore,\nrequire updated capital plans.\nAccordingly, the Federal\nReserve Board is requiring\neach firm, including Citi, to\nupdate and resubmit its\ncapital plan within 45 days\nafter the Federal Reserve\nBoard provides updated\nscenarios. The Federal Reserve\nBoard has indicated that it\nwill provide updated scenarios\nbetween September 8, 2020 and\nSeptember 30, 2020.\n\nRequiring resubmission will\ngenerally prohibit each firm\nfrom making any capital\ndistributions, unless\notherwise approved by the\nFederal Reserve Board. Through\nthe end of the third quarter\nof 2020, the Federal Reserve\nBoard has authorized firms,\nincluding Citi, to pay common\nstock dividends that do not\nexceed an amount equal to the\naverage of the firm\u2019s net\nincome for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters, unless\notherwise specified by the\nFederal Reserve Board,\nprovided that the firm does\nnot exceed the amount of\ncommon stock dividends paid in\nthe second quarter of 2020.\nAdditionally, through the end\nof the third quarter of 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve Board has\nauthorized firms to make share\nrepurchases relating to\nissuances of common stock\nrelated to employee stock\nownership plans, and to make\nscheduled payments on\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital and\nTier 2 Capital instruments.\nThese limitations on capital\ndistributions may be extended\nby the Federal Reserve Board.\n                               44                               \nOn June 29, 2020, Citi\nannounced that its planned\ncapital actions include common\ndividends. Citi declared\ncommon dividends of $0.51 per\nshare for the third quarter of\n2020 on July 23, 2020, which\nwould not be impacted by the\nFederal Reserve Board\u2019s\ntemporary limitations on\ncapital distributions, as\nCiti\u2019s average quarterly net\nincome for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters of $3.4\nbillion is more than\nsufficient under the four\nquarter average net income\ntest.\n\nThe March 2020 SCB final rule\nprovides that the Federal\nReserve Board may, but is not\nrequired to, recalculate each\nfirm\u2019s SCB as a result of the\ncapital plan resubmission.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Standards Developments                     \n                                                                \nTargeted Revisions to the\nCredit Valuation Adjustment\nFramework\n\nIn July 2020, the Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee)\nissued a standard with\ntargeted revisions to the\ncredit valuation adjustment\n(CVA) risk framework, which\nwas previously finalized in\nDecember 2017 and will become\neffective on January 1, 2023.\nThe revisions align the\nrevised CVA risk framework, in\npart, with the revised market\nrisk capital framework that\nwas finalized in January 2019.\nThe Basel Committee also\nadjusted the overall\ncalibration of capital\nrequirements calculated under\ntheir CVA risk framework.\n\nThe U.S. agencies may consider\nrevisions to the CVA risk\nframework under the U.S. Basel\nIII rules in the future, based\nupon the revisions adopted by\nthe Basel Committee.\n                               45                               \nTangible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Returns on\nEquity\n\nTangible common equity (TCE),\nas defined by Citi, represents\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity\nless goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nMSRs).

second\nquarter of 2020. Net credit\nloss rates were adversely\nimpacted by lower loan\nbalances primarily in credit\ncards, attributable to lower\ncustomer spending. The 90+\ndays past due delinquency rate\ndeclined sequentially despite\nthe lower balances, as reduced\nspending, combined with the\nbenefit of significant\ngovernment stimulus and\nassistance packages as well as\nCiti\u2019s consumer relief\nprograms, generated liquidity\nthat was used to make\npayments, particularly in\nNorth America . In addition,\nas discussed above, loans\nmodified under Citi\u2019s consumer\nrelief programs continue to be\nreported in the same\ndelinquency bucket they were\nin at the time of\nmodification, and thus would\nnot be reported as 90+ days\npast due for the duration of\nthe programs (which have\nvarious durations, and certain\nof which may be renewed by the\ncustomer) Citi expects that\n90+ days past due delinquency\nand net credit loss rates in\nNorth America GCB , Latin\nAmerica GCB and Asia GCB will\nbe adversely impacted by the\nevolving macroeconomic and\nmarket conditions, including\nthe severity and duration of\nthe impact from the pandemic\nas these government stimulus\nand consumer relief programs\nexpire.

As of June 30, 2020,\napproximately 71% of North\nAmerica GCB consumer loans\nconsisted of Citi-branded and\nCiti retail services cards,\nwhich generally drives the\noverall credit performance of\nNorth America GCB (for\nadditional information on\nNorth America GCB \u2019s cards\nportfolios, including\ndelinquency and net credit\nloss rates, see \u201cCredit Card\nTrends\u201d below). As shown in\nthe chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in North\nAmerica GCB increased quarter-\nover-quarter, primarily driven\nby lower average loans in both\ncards portfolios, while the\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrate decreased quarter-over-\nquarter, driven by the lower\nspending as well as the\ngovernment stimulus and relief\nprograms described above.\nYear-over-year, the net credit\nloss rate increased, primarily\ndriven by lower average loans\nand the seasoning of more\nrecent vintages in Citi-\nbranded cards.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past\ndue and (EOP loans) were $130 million ($0.5 billion), $124\nmillion ($0.5 billion) and $162 million ($0.6 billion) as of\nJune 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively.\nThe amounts excluded for loans 30\u201389 days past due and (EOP\nloans) were $86 million ($0.5 billion), $64 million ($0.5\nbillion) and $89 million ($0.6 billion) as of June 30, 2020,\nDecember 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively.\n\n(6) Asia includes delinquencies and loans in certain EMEA\ncountries for all periods presented.\n\n(7) The loans 90+ days past due and related ratios exclude U.S.\nmortgage loans that are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored\nagencies since the potential loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) for each period were $173 million ($0.4 billion),\n$167 million ($0.4 billion) and $273 million ($0.7 billion) as\nof June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019,\nrespectively.

Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated\nprobability of default for a counterparty and are derived by\nleveraging validated statistical models, scorecard models and\nexternal agency ratings (under defined circumstances), in\ncombination with consideration of factors specific to the\nobligor or market, such as management experience, competitive\nposition, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility\nrisk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of\ndefault of the obligor and factors that affect\n\nthe loss given default of the facility, such as support or\ncollateral. Internal obligor ratings that generally correspond\nto BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those\nbelow are considered non-investment grade. Citigroup also has\nincorporated environmental factors like climate risk assessment\nand reporting criteria for certain obligors, as necessary.\nFactors evaluated include consideration of climate risk to an\nobligor\u2019s business and physical assets and, when relevant,\nconsideration of cost-effective options to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions.\n                               54                               \nThe following table presents\nthe corporate credit portfolio\n(excluding the delinquency-\nmanaged private bank\nportfolio) by facility risk\nrating as a percentage of the\ntotal corporate credit\nportfolio:\n                                                                \n                    Total                                       \n                 exposure                          December     \n                 June 30,       March 31,               31,     \n                     2020            2020              2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A             49  %           48  %             50  %  \n  BBB                  31              33                33     \n  BB/B                 16              17                15     \n  CCC or                4               2                 2     \n  below                                                         \n  Total               100  %          100  %            100  %  \n                                                                \nNote: Total exposure includes\ndirect outstandings and\nunfunded lending commitments.\nIn addition to the\ncounterparty and facility risk\nratings assigned to all\nexposures, Citi may classify\nexposures in the corporate\ncredit portfolio. These\nclassifications are consistent\nwith Citi\u2019s interpretation of\nthe U.S. banking regulators\u2019\ndefinition of criticized\nexposures, which may\ncategorize exposures as\nspecial mention, substandard\nor doubtful. Risk ratings and\nclassifications are reviewed\nregularly, and adjusted as\nappropriate. The credit review\nprocess incorporates\nquantitative and qualitative\nfactors, including financial\nand non-financial disclosures\nor metrics, idiosyncratic\nevents or changes to the\ncompetitive, regulatory or\nmacroeconomic environment.\nThis includes but is not\nlimited to exposures in those\nsectors significantly impacted\nby the pandemic (including\nenergy and energy-related,\naviation, consumer retail,\ncommercial real estate and\nautos). Citigroup believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of June 30,\n2020. During the course of the\nsecond quarter of 2020, and\nsince the onset of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, Citigroup\nhas taken action to adjust\ninternal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen. As\nexposures are downgraded, the\nprobability of default\nincreases. Downgrades of\nexposures tend to result in a\nhigher provision for credit\nlosses. Additionally,\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other risk\nmitigants to hedge the\nincremental credit risk, or\nmay result in seeking to\nreduce exposure to an obligor\nor an industry sector.\nCitigroup will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure the\nappropriate probability of\ndefault is incorporated into\nall risk assessments.

Citi may\nenter into partial-term hedges\nas well as full-term hedges.\nIn advance of the expiration\nof partial-term hedges, Citi\nwill determine, among other\nfactors, the economic\nfeasibility of hedging the\nremaining life of the\ninstrument. The results of the\nmark-to-market and any\nrealized gains or losses on\ncredit derivatives are\nreflected primarily in\nPrincipal transactions in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome. At June 30, 2020,\nMarch 31, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, ICG (excluding the\ndelinquency-managed private\nbank portfolio) had economic\nhedges on the corporate credit\nportfolio of $36.5 billion,\n$33.0 billion and $32.1\nbillion, respectively.\nCitigroup\u2019s expected credit\nloss model used in the\ncalculation of its loan loss\nreserve does not include the\nfavorable impact of credit\nderivatives and other\nmitigants that are marked to\nmarket. In addition, the\nreported amounts of direct\noutstandings and unfunded\nlending commitments in the\ntables above do not reflect\nthe impact of these hedging\ntransactions. The credit\nprotection was economically\nhedging underlying ICG\n(excluding the delinquency-\nmanaged private bank\nportfolio) corporate credit\nportfolio exposures with the\nfollowing risk rating\ndistribution: Rating of Hedged\nExposure\n                                                                \n                                                   December     \n                 June 30,       March 31,               31,     \n                     2020            2020              2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A             30  %           32  %             36  %  \n  BBB                  53              52                51     \n  BB/B                 14              14                12     \n  CCC or                3               2                 1     \n  below                                                         \n  Total               100  %          100  %            100  %  \n                                                                \n                               58                               \n                                                                \n  ADDITIONAL CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CREDIT DETAILS              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Loans Outstanding                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  C\u2026                                                            \n  l\u2026                                                            \n  In                                                            \n  N\u2026       2nd        1st        4th         3rd        2nd     \n  A\u2026       Qt\u2026        Qt\u2026        Qt\u2026        Qtr.

Citi adopted Accounting Standards Update\n(ASC) 326, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (CECL) . The ASU\nintroduces a new credit loss methodology requiring earlier\nrecognition of credit losses while also providing additional\ntransparency about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi\nrecorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase\nin the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset\nincrease of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a\n$4.9 billion build to the Consumer allowance for credit losses\ndue to longer estimated tenors than under the incurred loss\nmethodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and (ii) a\n$(0.8) billion decrease to the Corporate allowance for credit\nlosses due to shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of\nrecoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based\non an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and\ngeographies. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further discussion on the impact of Citi\u2019s adoption of CECL.\n                               60                               \n(2) During the second quarter of 2020, Citi updated its ACLL\nestimate of lifetime credit losses resulting from a change in\naccounting for variable post-charge-off third-party agency\ncollection costs in its U.S. Consumer businesses. After June 30,\n2020, these costs will be recorded as operating expenses for\nfuture periods as they are incurred. The impact of this change\nin estimate effected by a change in accounting principle\nresulted in an approximate $426 million reduction in Citi's\nestimated ACLL at June 30, 2020. For additional information, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\u201d\nbelow.\n\n(3) Recoveries have been reduced by certain collection costs\nthat are incurred only if collection efforts are successful.\n\n(4) Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses,\nsuch as changes in the allowance from acquisitions,\ndispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase\naccounting adjustments, etc.\n\n(5) The second quarter of 2020 includes an increase of\napproximately $88 million related to FX translation.\n\n(6) The first quarter of 2020 includes a decrease of\napproximately $483 million related to FX translation.\n\n(7) The fourth quarter of 2019 includes an increase of\napproximately $86 million related to FX translation.\n\n(8) The third quarter of 2019 includes a decrease of\napproximately $65 million related to FX translation.\n\n(9) The second quarter of 2019 includes an increase of\napproximately $13 million related to FX translation.\n\n(10) June 30, 2020, March 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, September\n30, 2019, and June 30, 2019, exclude $5.8 billion, $4.0 billion,\n$4.1 billion, $3.9 billion, and $3.8 billion, respectively, of\nloans that are carried at fair value.\n\n(11) At June 30, 2020, the Corporate ACLUC includes a non-\nprovision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on\nperformance guarantees as of March 31, 2020.

These amounts include\nthe HQLA needed to meet the\nminimum requirements at these\nentities and any amounts in\nexcess of these minimums that\nare assumed to be transferable\nto other entities within\nCitigroup. Citigroup\u2019s HQLA\nincreased quarter-over-\nquarter, reflecting long-term\ndebt issuance and a portion of\nthe deposit growth at\nCitibank. While this deposit\ngrowth significantly increased\nliquidity at Citibank, a\nsignificant amount of this\nliquidity was not assumed to\nbe transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup and\ntherefore not included in\nCiti\u2019s consolidated HQLA. As\nof June 30, 2020, Citigroup\nhad approximately $900 billion\nof available liquidity\nresources to support client\nand business needs, including\nend-of-period HQLA assets;\nadditional unencumbered\nsecurities, including excess\nliquidity held at bank\nentities that is non-\ntransferable to other entities\nwithin Citigroup; and\navailable assets not already\naccounted for within the\nCiti\u2019s HQLA to support Federal\nHome Loan Bank (FHLB) and\nFederal Reserve Bank discount\nwindow borrowing capacity.\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR.

The\nweighted-average maturity is\ncalculated based on the\ncontractual maturity of each\nsecurity. For securities that\nare redeemable prior to\nmaturity at the option of the\nholder, the weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the earliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable.

(1) Parent and other\nincludes long-term debt issued\nto third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup)\nand Citi\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries (including\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries)\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup. As of June 30,\n2020, parent and other\nincluded $55.3 billion of\nlong-term debt issued by\nCiti\u2019s broker-dealer and other\nsubsidiaries, as well as\ncertain Citigroup consolidated\nhedging activities. (2) Local\ncountry and other includes\ndebt issued by Citi\u2019s\naffiliates in support of their\nlocal operations. Within\nparent and other, certain\nsecured financing is also\nincluded. Within bank,\nborrowings under certain U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored liquidity\nprograms are also included.\n(3) Predominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Citi-branded credit\ncard receivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\nincreased both year-over-year\nand sequentially, primarily\ndriven by the issuance of\nunsecured benchmark senior\ndebt and customer-related debt\nat the non-bank entities,\npartially offset by declines\nin unsecured benchmark senior\ndebt and securitizations at\nthe bank. Year-over-year, the\nincrease in long-term debt was\nalso driven by an increase in\nFHLB borrowings at the bank.\nAs part of its liability\nmanagement, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During the\nsecond quarter of 2020, Citi\nredeemed or repurchased an\naggregate of approximately\n$7.1 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               68

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n\nSecured Funding Transactions\n\nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $216\nbillion as of June 30, 2020\nincreased 19% from the prior-\nyear period and declined 3%\nsequentially. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nsecured funding increased 22%\nfrom the prior-year period and\ndeclined 4% sequentially, both\ndriven by normal business\nactivity. The average balances\nfor secured funding were\napproximately $225 billion for\nthe quarter ended June 30,\n2020.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nJune 30, 2020.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $40 billion decreased 5%\nyear-over-year and 27%\nsequentially, primarily driven\nby a decline in FHLB advances\n(see Note 16 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               70                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014 Liquidity Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $0.5 billion,\ncompared to $0.6 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2020. Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfinancing transactions and\nother margin requirements, for\nwhich there are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.4\nbillion, compared to $0.6\nbillion as of March 31, 2020.\n\nIn total, as of June 30, 2020,\nCiti estimates that a one-\nnotch downgrade of Citigroup\nand Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nresult in increased aggregate\ncash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $1.0 billion,\ncompared to $1.2 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2020 (see also Note\n19 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements). As\ndetailed under \u201cHigh-Quality\nLiquid Assets\u201d above,\nCitigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings from certain\nCitibank subsidiaries.\nMitigating actions available\nto Citibank include, but are\nnot limited to, selling or\nfinancing highly liquid\ngovernment securities,\ntailoring levels of secured\nlending, adjusting the size of\nselect trading assets,\nreducing loan originations and\nrenewals, raising additional\ndeposits or borrowing from the\nFHLB or central banks. Citi\nbelieves these mitigating\nactions could substantially\nreduce the funding and\nliquidity risk, if any, of the\npotential downgrades described\nabove.\n                               71                               \nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. As of June\n30, 2020, Citibank had\nliquidity commitments of\napproximately $11.0 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\ncompared to $12.2 billion as\nof March 31, 2020 (as\nreferenced in Note 18 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients\u2019 adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               72                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk emanates from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(265) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof June 30, 2020.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs shown in the table above,\nCiti increased its net\ninterest revenue exposure to\nan increase in interest rates.\nThe increase was predominantly\nin U.S. dollar exposure, which\nchanged from a liability-\nsensitive $(142) million as of\nMarch 31, 2020 to a more\nasset-sensitive $27 million as\nof June 30, 2020, primarily\ndriven by placement of a large\nincrease in deposits into cash\nequivalents and investments.\n\nThe relatively small quarterly\nchange in the estimated impact\nto AOCI primarily reflected a\ncontinuation of the\npositioning strategy of Citi\nTreasury\u2019s investment\nsecurities and related\ninterest rate derivatives\nportfolio. In the event of a\nparallel instantaneous 100 bps\nincrease in interest rates,\nCiti expects that the negative\nimpact to AOCI would be offset\nin stockholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio over a period of\ntime. As of June 30, 2020,\nCiti expects that the negative\n$5.7 billion impact to AOCI in\nsuch a scenario could\npotentially be offset over\napproximately 38 months.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under five\ndifferent changes in interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and Citi\u2019s other\ncurrencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d). The rate\nscenarios are also impacted by\nconvexity related to mortgage\nproducts.\n\nAdditionally, in the table\nbelow, the magnitude of the\nimpact to Citi\u2019s net interest\nrevenue and AOCI is greater\nunder Scenario 2 as compared\nto Scenario 3. This is because\nthe combination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  of                                                            \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  ex\u2026                                                           \n  as                                                            \n  ot\u2026                                                           \n  no\u2026                                                           \n  Ov\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  10\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  an\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to        Sce\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026  \n  net          1          2           3          4           5  \n  in\u2026        100        100           \u2014          \u2014       (100)  \n  re\u2026        100          \u2014         100       (10\u2026       (100)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.\u2026    $    27    $    95    $    239    $  -147    $   -219  \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  All                                                           \n  ot\u2026        683        602          37        -37        -354  \n  cu\u2026                                                           \n  To\u2026    $   710    $   697    $    276    $  -184    $   -573  \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  -5,\u2026    $  -3,\u2026    $  -2,0\u2026    $  1,4\u2026    $  3,019  \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to                                                            \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  Eq\u2026        -35        -24         -13          8          13  \n  Ti\u2026                                                           \n  1                                                             \n  Ca\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur\ninstantaneously.

This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nIndian rupee, Euro and\nAustralian dollar.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency translation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the impact\nof these changes on Citi\u2019s TCE\nand Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

As of June 30, 2020, Citi estimates\nthe conservative features of the VAR calibration contribute an\napproximate 49% add-on to what would be a VAR estimated under\nthe assumption of stable and normally distributed markets,\ncompared to 348% at March 31, 2020.\n\nThe realized volatilities in June 2020 declined from March 2020\nby 57%, 47%, 85%, and 68% for the S&P 500, the U.S. 5-year\nTreasury yield, the USD BBB Bond spread, and the CDX IG Credit\nspread, respectively, as illustrated below.\n\nSuch decline is also seen in the VIX index, which showed a\nquicker decline than in 2008.\n                               85                               \nAs set forth in the table below, Citi\u2019s average trading VAR and\naverage trading and credit portfolio VAR both increased during\nthe second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of\n2020. The increases were primarily due to substantially higher\nmarket volatility related to the pandemic that occurred late in\nthe first quarter and continued into the second quarter, despite\ndeclines in end-of-period VAR. As Citi uses a log normal\ndistribution for credit spread risk rather than a normal\nmodeling approach, the VAR increase for the credit spread risk\ncontribution to the trading VAR was magnified by the increase in\ncredit spread levels, as well the increase in realized\nvolatilities (see USD BBB bond spread above). The proportionally\nhigher increase in trading and credit portfolio VAR was also\nreflective of this modelling impact on the relative contribution\nof CVA exposures and mark-to-market CDS hedges of loan exposures\naccounted for under accrual methods.\n\nQuarter-end and Average Trading VAR and Trading and Credit\nPortfolio VAR\n                                                                \n

Buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss excludes\nrealized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and\ncommissions, intra-day trading\nprofit and loss and changes in\nreserves. Based on a 99%\nconfidence level, Citi would\nexpect two to three days in\nany one year where buy-and-\nhold losses exceed the\nRegulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of\nCiti\u2019s VAR model (as a result\nof taking the greater of\nshort- and long-term\nvolatilities and fat-tail\nscaling of volatilities), Citi\nwould expect fewer exceptions\nunder normal and stable market\nconditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions\ncould increase the number of\nback-testing exceptions. There\nwere no back-testing\nexceptions during the second\nquarter of 2020. As of June\n30, 2020, there were four\nback-testing exceptions\nobserved for Citi\u2019s Regulatory\nVAR for the prior 12 months.\nAll of those exceptions\noccurred during March 2020 due\nto the significant market\nvolatility in response to the\npandemic.\n                               87                               \n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \nFor additional information on\nstrategic risk at Citi, see\n\u201cStrategic Risk\u201d in Citi\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of June 30, 2020. The total\nexposure as of June 30, 2020\nto the top 25 countries\ndisclosed below, in\ncombination with the U.S.,\nwould represent approximately\n95% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries. For purposes of the\ntable, loan amounts are\nreflected in the country where\nthe loan is booked, which is\ngenerally based on the\ndomicile of the borrower. For\nexample, a loan to a Chinese\nsubsidiary of a Switzerland-\nbased corporation will\ngenerally be categorized as a\nloan in China. In addition,\nCiti has\n\ndeveloped regional booking\ncenters in certain countries,\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers. As an\nexample, for U.K. exposure,\nonly 35% of corporate loans\npresented in the table below\nare to U.K. domiciled entities\n(and 36% of unfunded lending\ncommitments are to U.K.\ndomiciled entities), with the\nbalance of the loans\npredominately outstanding to\nEuropean domiciled\ncounterparties. Approximately\n75% of the total U.K. funded\nloans and 88% of the total\nU.K. unfunded lending\ncommitments were investment\ngrade as of June 30, 2020.\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

For\nadditional information about\nCiti\u2019s exposures in Argentina,\nsee \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Country Risk\u2014Argentina\u201d\nin Citi\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\nIn April 2020, the government\nof Argentina announced a\npostponement of debt payments\nrelated to foreign currency\ndebt issued under foreign law,\nand the Argentine government\nhas been negotiating a\nrestructuring with the primary\nbondholders. In addition, the\ngovernment of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat restrict Citi\u2019s ability\nto access U.S. dollars in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of June 30,\n2020, the international NDF\nmarket had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge a significant portion of\nits Argentine peso exposure.\nTo the extent that Citi is\nunable to execute additional\nNDF contracts in the future,\ndevaluations on Citi\u2019s net\nArgentine peso-denominated\nassets would be recorded in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate loan\nloss reserves on its Argentine\nloans, and appropriate fair\nvalue adjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\nsuch risks under U.S. GAAP as\nof June 30, 2020. However,\ngiven the recent events in\nArgentina, U.S. regulatory\nagencies may require Citi to\nrecord additional reserves in\nthe future, increasing ICG \u2019s\ncost of credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K and\nin Citigroup\u2019s 2020 Report on\nForm 10-Q for the quarterly\nperiod ended March 31, 2020\ncontain a summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCitigroup\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nmajority of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repurchase\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repurchase\nagreements), a majority of\nwhich are carried at fair\nvalue. In addition, certain\nloans, short-term borrowings,\nlong-term debt and deposits,\nas well as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the\n\nvaluation of an instrument and\nthe degree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. These judgments have\nthe potential to impact the\nCompany\u2019s financial\nperformance for instruments\nwhere the changes in fair\nvalue are recognized in either\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nare recognized in earnings.\nWhere Citi does not intend to\nsell the security nor could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nthe portion of the loss\nrelated to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAdjudicating the temporary\nnature of fair value\nimpairments is also inherently\njudgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                             \n                                                                \nCiti provides reserves for an\nestimate of current expected\ncredit losses in the funded\nloan portfolio and for the\nunfunded lending commitments,\nstandby letters of credit and\nfinancial guarantees on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet in\nAllowance for credit losses on\nloans (ACLL) and Other\nliabilities , respectively. In\naddition, Citi provides\nallowances for an estimate of\ncurrent expected credit losses\nfor other financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost,\nincluding held-to-maturity\nsecurities, reverse repurchase\nagreements, securities\nborrowed, deposits with banks\nand other financial\nreceivables carried at\namortized cost (these\nallowances, together with the\nACLL, are referred to as the\nACL).\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. For the\nquantitative component, Citi\nuses a single forward-looking\nmacroeconomic forecast across\nthe Company complemented by a\nqualitative component. This\nqualitative component reflects\neconomic uncertainty related\nto a separate scenario and an\nalternative downside scenario,\nalong with specific\nadjustments based on the\nassociated portfolio for\nestimating the ACL.\n                               90                               \n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses based upon (i) its\ninternal system of credit risk\nratings, (ii) its\ncomprehensive internal history\nand rating agency information\nregarding default rates and\nloss data, including internal\ndata on the severity of losses\nin the event of default, and\n(iii) a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast of future\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n\nCiti\u2019s expected credit loss is\ndetermined primarily by\nutilizing models for the\nborrowers\u2019 probability of\ndefault (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nuse both internal and external\ninformation and are sensitive\nto changes in macroeconomic\nvariables that inform the\nforecasts. Adjustments may be\nmade to this data, including\n(i) statistically calculated\nestimates to cover the\nhistorical fluctuation of the\ndefault rates over the credit\ncycle, the historical\nvariability of loss severity\namong defaulted loans and\nobligor concentrations in the\nglobal portfolio, and (ii)\nadjustments made for\nspecifically known items, such\nas other current economic\nfactors and credit trends.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s\ndelinquency-managed portfolios\ncontaining smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans also use PD\nx LGD x EAD models to\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses and reserve balances\nbased on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies and changes in\nportfolio size, as well as\neconomic trends, including\nhousing prices, unemployment\nand gross domestic product\n(GDP). This methodology is\napplied separately for each\nproduct within each geographic\nregion in which these\nportfolios exist.\n\nThis evaluation process is\nsubject to numerous estimates\nand judgments. The frequency\nof default, risk ratings, loss\nrecovery rates, size and\ndiversity of individual large\ncredits and ability of\nborrowers with foreign\ncurrency obligations to obtain\nthe foreign currency necessary\nfor orderly debt servicing,\namong other things, are all\ntaken into account. Changes in\nthese estimates could have a\ndirect impact on Citi\u2019s credit\ncosts and the allowance in any\nperiod.\n                                                                \n  Qualitative Component                                         \n                                                                \nAny adjustments needed to the\nmodeled expected losses in the\nquantitative calculations are\naddressed through a\nqualitative adjustment. The\nqualitative adjustment\nconsiders, among other things:\nthe uncertainty of forward-\nlooking scenarios based on the\nlikelihood and severity of a\npossible recession, the\nuncertainty of economic\nconditions, certain portfolio\ncharacteristics and\nconcentrations, collateral\ncoverage, model limitations,\nidiosyncratic events and other\nrelevant criteria under\nbanking supervisory guidance\nfor loan loss reserves. The\nqualitative adjustment also\nreflects the estimated impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on\neconomic forecasts and the\nimpact on credit loss\nestimates. The total ACL is\ncomposed of the quantitative\nand qualitative components.\n\nCiti calculates a judgmental\nmanagement adjustment, which\nis an alternative, more\nadverse scenario that only\nconsiders downside risk. The\nmanagement adjustment\nincorporated this alternate\npandemic downside scenario at\na 15% likelihood, which\ncontributed to an increase in\nthe Provision for credit\nlosses of approximately $0.8\nbillion and ending ACL\nreserves of $2.3 billion in\nthe quarter.\n                                                                \n  Combined Quantitative and Qualitative Components              \n                                                                \nCiti built the ACL by $2.1\nbillion for its consumer\nportfolios and $3.5 billion\nfor its corporate portfolios\nin the second quarter of 2020,\nprimarily due to deterioration\nin macroeconomic conditions as\na result of the pandemic. The\nACL reflects both a\nquantitative component and a\nqualitative management\nadjustment based on Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic forecast as of\nJune 22, 2020.\n\nThe quantitative and\nqualitative components of the\nACL for the second quarter of\n2020 reflect the estimated\nimpact of the pandemic on\neconomic forecasts and the\nimpact on credit loss\nestimates, and include\nreserves for loans modified\nunder the CARES Act and\nInteragency Guidance. The\noutlook around many of these\nmetrics, such as GDP and\nunemployment, continues to\nevolve. Citi believes its\nanalysis of the ACL reflects\nthe forward view of the\neconomic analysis as of June\n30, 2020, based on the June\n22, 2020 forecast. Citi\nexpects a higher level of net\ncredit losses during the\nremainder of 2020, partially\noffset by the release of\nexisting reserves.\n\nThe extent of the pandemic\u2019s\nultimate impact will depend,\namong other things, upon (i)\nhow consumers respond to the\nvarious consumer relief\nprograms established by the\nfederal government, as well as\nCiti\u2019s own customer relief\nefforts, and how the federal\ngovernment stimulus programs\nare implemented by small and\nmedium-size businesses; (ii)\nthe impact on unemployment,\nwhich is unclear; (iii) the\ntiming and extent of the\neconomic recovery; (iv)\nwhether there is a resurgence\nof COVID-19 as businesses and\nschools reopen and the extent\nof that resurgence; and (v)\nthe extent of market\nvolatility.\n\nImpact to ACL Estimate as a\nResult of a Voluntary Change\nin the Accounting for Variable\nPost-Charge-Off Third-Party\nCollection Costs\n\nDuring the second quarter of\n2020, there was a change in\nCiti`s ACL accounting estimate\neffected by a change in Citi`s\naccounting principle for\nvariable post-charge-off\nthird-party collection costs.\nThese costs were previously\naccounted for as a reduction\nin credit recoveries. As a\nresult of this change,\nbeginning July 1, 2020, these\ncosts are accounted for as an\nincrease in operating\nexpenses. Determining a\npreferable method of\naccounting for such costs is a\njudgmental matter; however,\nCiti concluded that such a\nchange in the method of\naccounting is preferable in\nCiti\u2019s circumstances as it\nbetter reflects the nature of\nthese collection costs to\ninvestors. That is, these\ncosts do not represent reduced\npayments from borrowers and\nare similar to Citi\u2019s other\nexecutory third-party vendor\ncontracts that are accounted\nfor as operating expenses as\nincurred.\n\nAs a result of this accounting\nchange, Citi`s estimate for\nthe consumer ACL was impacted\nand resulted in a one-time ACL\nrelease of approximately $426\nmillion in the second quarter\nof 2020. This one-time ACL\nrelease reflects the impact to\nCiti\u2019s ACL estimate of the\nrevised credit recoveries\nincorporated in the ACL\nmodels. This change in\naccounting will result in a\nreclassification of\napproximately $50 million of\ncollection costs from credit\nrecoveries to operating\nexpenses each quarter,\nbeginning with the third\nquarter of 2020.\n                               91                               \nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nuses a multitude of variables\nin its macroeconomic forecast,\nincluding both domestic and\ninternational variables for\nits various portfolios\nspanning Citi\u2019s global\nportfolios and exposures. The\ntwo key macroeconomic\nvariables that most\nsignificantly affect the\nestimation of the consumer and\ncorporate ACL are Citi\u2019s\nestimates of the U.S.\nunemployment rate and U.S. GDP\ngrowth rate. The tables below\nshow these macroeconomic\nvariables used for Citi\u2019s 2Q20\nand 1Q20 consumer and\ncorporate ACL, comparing\nCiti\u2019s forecasted (1) 4Q20,\n2Q21 and 4Q21 quarterly\naverage U.S. unemployment\nrate, and (2) cumulative U.S.\nGDP forecasted growth rate for\n4Q20, 2Q21 and 4Q21:\n                                                                \n                            Quarterly                           \n                              average                           \n  U.S.                           4Q20       2Q21       4Q21     \n  unemployment                                                  \n  Citi forecast                   7.1  %     6.7  %     6.5  %  \n  at 1Q20                                                       \n  Citi forecast                   8.9        7.2        5.9     \n  at 2Q20                                                       \n                                                                \n                                                                \n                           Cumulative                           \n                     growth rate from                           \n                                 4Q19                           \n                     (pre-pandemic)(\u2026                           \n  U.S. GDP                       4Q20       2Q21       4Q21     \n  Citi forecast                  -2.4  %    -0.9  %     0.1  %  \n  at 1Q20                                                       \n  Citi forecast                  -4.0       -1.0        0.7     \n  at 2Q20                                                       \n                                                                \n(1) The cumulative growth rate is the percentage change in the\nreal (inflation adjusted) GDP level relative to 4Q19 level (pre-\npandemic). Consumer The CECL impact for the consumer portfolio\nis largely driven by the cards businesses, where the receivables\nhave longer estimated tenors under the CECL lifetime expected\ncredit loss methodology, net of recoveries. As discussed above,\nthe total consumer (including Corporate/Other) ACL build of $2.1\nbillion in the second quarter of 2020 increased the ACL balance\nto $19.6 billion, or 6.97% of total consumer loans, and\nreflected the update of the macroeconomic forecast scenario for\nthe second quarter. This ACL build resulted in an increase in\nreserves for credit cards to 11.21% of EOP loans at June 30,\n2020 (this ACL build was reduced by $426 million for the change\nin accounting for third-party collection costs discussed above),\ncompared to 9.5% of EOP loans at March 31, 2020. For the\nremaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to\nEOP loans increased to 2.2% at June 30, 2020, compared to 1.8%\nat March 31, 2020. Corporate The corporate ACLL build of $3.4\nbillion in the second quarter of 2020 increased the ACLL reserve\nbalance to $6.8 billion, or 1.71% of total funded loans, and\nreflected the update of the macroeconomic forecast scenario for\nthe second quarter of 2020 and the significant credit downgrades\nmade through the end of the quarter. Durables, transportation\nand logistics, and energy were key contributors to the increase\nin reserves, driven by the\n\ncombined impact of significant downgrades and changes in the\nmacroeconomic scenario. From a geography perspective, the U.S.,\nE.U., Mexico and Brazil were the key contributors to the reserve\nbuild. ACL Sensitivity In the second quarter of 2020 ACL\nestimate, Citi employed a base set of economic variables in its\nCECL models and supplemented that with a more adverse scenario\n(qualitative adjustment). The adverse scenario, using a\nprobability weighting of 15%, represents approximately $2.3\nbillion of the overall ACL balance of $28.5 billion at June 30,\n2020. The adverse scenario incorporates more adverse economic\nvariables (e.g., 400\u2013500 bps in higher unemployment rates\nthrough 2021 and slower GDP recovery). To the extent that the\nprobability of the adverse scenario increases, a corresponding\nincrease in reserves would be expected. It is important to note\nthe following: \u2022 The above cannot be used to estimate the\noverall impact on the ACL, as the amount of the qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL (including, but not limited to, the\neconomic uncertainty management adjustment) could be different\nunder alternative macroeconomic scenarios and changes in the\nportfolio. \u2022 The pandemic has had, and will likely continue to\nhave, a severe impact on global economic conditions and the\nvariability in macroeconomic variables, and their impacts on\ncredit loss estimates could be material. ACLL and Non-accrual\nRatios At June 30, 2020, the ratio of the allowance for credit\nlosses to total funded loans was 3.89% (7.00% for consumer loans\nand 1.71% for corporate loans), compared to 2.91% at March 31,\n2020 (6.10% for consumer loans and 0.81% for corporate loans).\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans were $5.8 billion at June 30,\n2020, up $1.7 billion from March 31, 2020. Consumer non-accrual\nloans increased to $1.8 billion at June 30, 2020 from $1.7\nbillion at March 31, 2020, while corporate non-accrual loans\ngrew to $4.0 billion at June 30, 2020 from $2.5 billion at March\n31, 2020. In addition, the ratio of non-accrual loans to total\ncorporate loans was 0.99%, and 0.66% for total consumer loans,\nat June 30, 2020. Regulatory Capital Impact Citi has elected to\nphase in the CECL impact for regulatory capital purposes. The\ntransition provisions were recently modified to defer the phase-\nin. After two years with no impact on capital, the CECL\ntransition impact will phase in over a three-year transition\nperiod with 25% of the impact (net of deferred taxes) recognized\non the first day of each subsequent year, commencing January 1,\n2022, and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2025. In\naddition, 25% of the build (pretax) made in 2020 will be\ndeferred and amortized through the same timeframe.\n                               92                               \nFor a further description of\nthe allowance for credit\nlosses and related accounts,\nsee Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor a discussion of the\nrecently adopted CECL\naccounting pronouncement, see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually as of July\n1 (the annual test) and\nthrough interim assessments\nbetween annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more-likely-\nthan-not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its\ncarrying amount, such as a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsignificant decline in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nCiti qualitatively assessed\nthe environment in the second\nquarter of 2020, including the\nestimated impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on\nmacroeconomic variables and\neconomic forecasts and how\nthose might impact the fair\nvalue of reporting units.\nThere is significant\nuncertainty with how the\npandemic will evolve, but Citi\nexpects that it will continue\nto have a significant impact\nduring the remainder of 2020.\nAs discussed above the extent\nof the pandemic\u2019s impact will\ndepend upon (i) how consumers\nrespond to the various\nconsumer relief programs\nestablished by the federal\ngovernment, as well as Citi\u2019s\nown customer relief efforts,\nand how the federal corporate\nstimulus programs are\nimplemented by small and\nmedium-size businesses; (ii)\nthe impact on unemployment,\nwhich is unclear; (iii) the\ntiming and extent of the\neconomic recovery; (iv)\nwhether there is a resurgence\nof COVID-19 as businesses and\nschools reopen and the extent\nof that resurgence; and (v)\nthe extent of market\nvolatility.\n\nAfter consideration of the\ncurrent economic conditions,\nincluding the potential impact\nof the pandemic on business\nperformance as mentioned\nabove, the change in estimated\nmarket cost of equity, the\nactual and projected business\nperformance and the results of\nthe 2019 impairment test, Citi\ndetermined it was not more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair\nvalue of any reporting unit\nwas below book value as of\nJune 30, 2020. See Note 15 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements for a further\ndiscussion on goodwill.\n                                                                \n  Litigation Accruals                                           \n                                                                \nSee the discussion in Note 23\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for information\nregarding Citi\u2019s policies on\nestablishing accruals for\nlitigation and regulatory\ncontingencies.\n                               93                               \nINCOME TAXES Deferred Tax\nAssets For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s deferred\ntax assets (DTAs), see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks,\u201d\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Income Taxes\u201d and\nNotes 1 and 9 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. At\nJune 30, 2020, Citigroup had\nrecorded net DTAs of\napproximately $23.9 billion,\nan increase of $1.8 billion\nfrom March 31, 2020 and an\nincrease of $0.8 billion from\nDecember 31, 2019. The\nincrease for the quarter was\nprimarily driven by the higher\nlevel of allowance for credit\nloss reserves recorded during\nthe quarter.

Net DTAs arising from\ntemporary differences are deducted from regulatory capital if in\nexcess of the 10%/15% limitations (see \u201cCapital Resources\u201d\nabove). For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, Citi did not have\nany such DTAs. Accordingly, the remaining $14.2 billion of net\nDTAs as of June 30, 2020 was not deducted in calculating\nregulatory capital pursuant to Basel III standards and was\nappropriately risk weighted under those rules.\n\nDTA Realizability Citi believes that the realization of the\nrecognized net DTAs of $23.9 billion at June 30, 2020 is more-\nlikely-than-not based upon management\u2019s expectations as to\nfuture taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs\narise, as well as consideration of available tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ). In the\nsecond quarter of 2020, as part of the normal planning process,\nCiti updated its forecasts of operating income and its foreign\nsource income. With respect to Citi\u2019s general basket for foreign\ntax credits (FTCs), Citi\u2019s revised forecast of lower pretax\nincome, mitigated by actions around geographic and legal entity\nasset movements, enabled Citi to maintain a sufficient level of\nforecasted taxable income in U.S. locations derived from sources\noutside the U.S. The effect is no change in Citi\u2019s general\nbasket valuation allowance in the second quarter while resulting\nin an immaterial release of valuation allowance for non-U.S.\nbranches with respect to current year activity. Moreover, the\nforecast updates did not require Citi to adjust its FTC\nvaluation allowance for future years. In light of the COVID-19\npandemic, however, which adds additional uncertainty as to\nCiti\u2019s ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the\nFTC carry-forwards period, Citi will continue to monitor its\nforecasts and mix of earnings, which could affect such valuation\nallowance. Effective Tax Rate Citi\u2019s reported effective tax rate\nfor the second quarter of 2020 was approximately 9%, compared to\napproximately 22% in the second quarter of 2019. The lower rate\nreflects the higher relative impact of tax-advantaged\ninvestments and tax benefits for non-U.S. branch-related FTCs\ndiscussed above, on a lower level and changing geographic mix of\nearnings before taxes.\n                               94                               \n                                                                \n   DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                           \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nJune 30, 2020. Based on that\nevaluation, the CEO and CFO\nhave concluded that at that\ndate Citigroup\u2019s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were\neffective.\n\nDISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION\n219 OF THE IRAN THREAT\nREDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN\nRIGHTS ACT\n\nPursuant to Section 219 of the\nIran Threat Reduction and\nSyria Human Rights Act of\n2012, which added Section\n13(r) to the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as\namended, Citi is required to\ndisclose in its annual or\nquarterly reports, as\napplicable, whether it or any\nof its affiliates knowingly\nengaged in certain activities,\ntransactions or dealings\nrelating to Iran or with\nindividuals or entities that\nare subject to sanctions under\nU.S. law.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of June 30, 2020\nand for the three- and-six-\nmonth periods ended June 30,\n2020 and 2019 include the\naccounts of Citigroup Inc. and\nits consolidated subsidiaries.\nIn the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded in Citigroup\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31,\n2019 (2019 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K) and Citigroup\u2019s\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended March\n31, 2020 (First Quarter of\n2020 Form 10-Q). Certain\nfinancial information that is\nnormally included in annual\nfinancial statements prepared\nin accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP), but is not\nrequired for interim reporting\npurposes, has been condensed\nor omitted. Management must\nmake estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the\nrelated footnote disclosures.\nWhile management uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications have been\nmade to the prior periods\u2019\nfinancial statements and notes\nto conform to the current\nperiod\u2019s presentation. SUMMARY\nOF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES See Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in both Citigroup\u2019s\n2019 Annual Report on Form\n10-K and Citigroup\u2019s First\nQuarter of 2020 Form 10-Q for\na summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting\nfor Financial Instruments \u2014\nCredit Losses Overview In June\n2016, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) issued\nASU No. 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments \u2014 Credit Losses\n(Topic 326). The ASU\nintroduced a new credit loss\nmethodology, the Current\nExpected Credit Losses (CECL)\nmethodology, which requires\nearlier recognition of credit\nlosses while also providing\nadditional transparency about\ncredit risk. Citi adopted the\nASU as of January 1, 2020,\nwhich, as discussed below,\nresulted in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s Allowance for credit\nlosses and a decrease to\nopening Retained earnings ,\nnet of deferred income taxes,\nat January 1, 2020. The CECL\nmethodology utilizes a\nlifetime \u201cexpected credit\nloss\u201d measurement objective\nfor the recognition of credit\nlosses for loans, held-to-\nmaturity debt securities,\nreceivables and other\nfinancial assets measured at\namortized cost at the time the\nfinancial asset is originated\nor acquired. The allowance for\ncredit losses is adjusted each\nperiod for changes in expected\nlifetime credit losses. The\nCECL methodology represents a\nsignificant change from prior\nU.S. GAAP and replaced the\nprior multiple existing\nimpairment methods, which\ngenerally required that a loss\nbe incurred before it was\nrecognized. Within the life\ncycle of a loan or other\nfinancial asset, the\nmethodology generally results\nin the earlier recognition of\nthe provision for credit\nlosses and the related\nallowance for credit losses\nthan prior U.S. GAAP. For\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities where fair value is\nless than cost that Citi\nintends to hold or more-\nlikely-than-not will not be\nrequired to sell, credit-\nrelated impairment, if any, is\nrecognized through an\nallowance for credit losses\nand adjusted each period for\nchanges in credit risk.\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL\nTransition (Day 1) Impact The\nCECL methodology\u2019s impact on\nexpected credit losses, among\nother things, reflects Citi\u2019s\nview of the current state of\nthe economy, forecasted\nmacroeconomic conditions and\nCiti\u2019s portfolios. At the\nJanuary 1, 2020 date of\nadoption, based on forecasts\nof macroeconomic conditions\nand exposures at that time,\nthe aggregate impact to Citi\nwas an approximate $\n4.1billion, or an approximate\n29%, pretax increase in the\nAllowance for credit losses ,\nalong with a $ 3.1billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained\nearnings and a deferred tax\nasset increase of $\n1.0billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $\n4.9billion build to the\nAllowance for credit losses\nfor Citi\u2019s consumer exposures,\nprimarily driven by the impact\non credit card receivables of\nlonger estimated tenors under\nthe CECL lifetime expected\ncredit loss methodology (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n23months) compared to shorter\nestimated tenors under the\nprobable loss methodology\nunder prior U.S. GAAP (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n14months), net of recoveries;\nand (ii) a release of $\n0.8billion of reserves\nprimarily related to Citi\u2019s\ncorporate net loan loss\nexposures, largely due to more\nprecise contractual maturities\nthat result in\n                              108                               \nshorter remaining tenors, incorporation of recoveries and use of\nmore specific historical loss data based on an increase in\nportfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. Under\nthe CECL methodology, the Allowance for credit losses consists\nof quantitative and qualitative components. Citi\u2019s quantitative\ncomponent of the Allowance for credit losses is model based and\nutilizes a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast,\ncomplemented by the qualitative component described below, in\nestimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the\ncorporate classifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and\nsupportable forecast periods vary by product. For example,\nCiti\u2019s consumer models use a 13-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period and revert to historical loss experience\nthereafter, while its corporate loan models use a nine-quarter\nreasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter\ngraduated transition to historical loss experience. Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the Allowance for credit losses\nconsiders (i) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios based\non the likelihood and severity of a possible recession as\nanother possible scenario; (ii) certain portfolio\ncharacteristics, such as portfolio concentration and collateral\ncoverage; and (iii) model limitations as well as idiosyncratic\nevents. Citi calculates a judgmental management adjustment,\nwhich is an alternative, more adverse scenario that only\nconsiders downside risk. Subsequent Measurement of Goodwill In\nJanuary 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles \u2014\nGoodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for\nGoodwill Impairment . The ASU simplifies the subsequent\nmeasurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating the\nrequirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill\n(i.e., previously referred to as step 2 of the goodwill\nimpairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Under\nthe ASU, the impairment test is the comparison of the fair value\nof a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with the\nimpairment charge being the deficit in fair value, but not\nexceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit. The simplified one-step impairment test applies\nto all reporting units (including those with zero or negative\ncarrying amounts). The ASU was adopted by Citi as of January 1,\n2020 with prospective application and did not impact the first\nor second quarters of 2020 results. The future impact of the ASU\nwill depend upon the performance of Citi\u2019s reporting units and\nthe market conditions impacting the fair value of each reporting\nunit going forward. Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the\nFASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on\nFinancial Reporting , which provides optional guidance to ease\nthe potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the\neffects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting.\nSpecifically, the guidance permits an entity, when certain\ncriteria are met, to consider amendments to contracts made to\ncomply with reference rate reform to meet the definition of a\nmodification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows hedge accounting\nto be maintained and a one-time transfer or sale of qualifying\nheld-to-maturity securities. The expedients and exceptions\nprovided by the amendments are permitted to be adopted any time\nthrough December 31, 2022 and do not apply to contract\nmodifications made and hedging relationships entered into or\nevaluated after December 31, 2022, except for certain optional\nexpedients elected for certain hedging relationships existing as\nof December 31, 2022. The ASU was adopted by Citi as of June 30,\n2020 with prospective application and did not impact the second\nquarter of 2020 results. Voluntary Change in the Accounting for\nVariable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection Costs During the\nsecond quarter of 2020, there was a change in Citi`s ACL\naccounting estimate effected by a change in Citi`s accounting\nprinciple for variable post-charge-off third-party collection\ncosts. These costs were previously accounted for as a reduction\nin credit recoveries. As a result of this change, beginning July\n1, 2020, these costs are accounted for as an increase in\noperating expenses. Determining a preferable method of\naccounting for such costs is a judgmental matter; however, Citi\nconcluded that such a change in the method of accounting is\npreferable in Citi\u2019s circumstances as it better reflects the\nnature of these collection costs to investors. That is, these\ncosts do not represent reduced payments from borrowers and are\nsimilar to Citi\u2019s other executory third-party vendor contracts\nthat are accounted for as operating expenses as incurred. As a\nresult of this accounting change, Citi`s estimate for the\nconsumer ACL was impacted and resulted in a one-time ACL release\nof approximately $ 426million in the second quarter of 2020.\nThis one-time ACL release reflects the impact to Citi\u2019s ACL\nestimate of the revised credit recoveries incorporated in the\nACL models.

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value, as described in Notes 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The remaining portion is\ncarried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities\nloaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount\ngenerally in excess of the market value of the securities\nloaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities\nborrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or\nposts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection. The following tables present the gross and\nnet resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing\nand lending agreements and the related offsetting amounts\npermitted under ASC 210-20-45.

Evaluating Investments for Impairment AFS Debt\nSecurities Overview\u2014AFS Debt Securities The Company conducts\nperiodic reviews of all AFS debt securities with unrealized\nlosses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected\ncredit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the\nCompany\u2019s intent to sell such securities. An AFS debt security\nis impaired when the current fair value of an individual AFS\ndebt security is less than its amortized cost basis. The Company\nrecognizes the entire difference between amortized cost basis\nand fair value in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that\nCiti has an intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of\nthe amortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the\n                              131                               \namount by which the AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis\nexceeds its fair value. The allowance is increased or decreased\nif credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals\nof credit losses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s\nreview for impairment of AFS debt securities generally entails:\n\u2022 identification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under business policies. The sections\nbelow describe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected\ncredit impairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of June 30, 2020. Mortgage-\nBacked Securities Citi records no allowances for credit losses\non U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities,\nbecause the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the\nevent of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses\nand due to the nature of the counterparties. State and Municipal\nSecurities The process for estimating credit losses in\nCitigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily based on\na credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings.\nCiti monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing\ndefault protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance.\nThe average external credit rating, ignoring any insurance, is\nAa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other\nindicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-\nspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer\ndefault), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse\nchanges in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell, or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is\nrecognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where\nCiti has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an\nallowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects\nnot to collect, capped at the difference between the bond\u2019s\namortized cost basis and fair value. Equity Method Investments\nManagement assesses equity method investments that have fair\nvalues that are less than their respective carrying values for\nother-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured\nas price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly\nlisted securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other\nmethods are used (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). For impaired equity method investments that Citi\nplans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair\nvalue will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized in earnings as OTTI regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether\nthe impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the cause of the impairment and the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,\nincluding any specific events that may influence the operations\nof the issuer; \u2022 the intent and ability to hold the investment\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in market value; and \u2022 the length of time and extent to\nwhich fair value has been less than the carrying value.\n                              132

Equity\nSecurities Not Carried at Fair\nValue Non-marketable equity\nsecurities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.\nImpairment indicators that are\nconsidered include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n\u2022 a significant deterioration\nin the earnings performance,\ncredit rating, asset quality\nor business prospects of the\ninvestee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the\nregulatory, economic or\ntechnological environment of\nthe investee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the general\nmarket condition of either the\ngeographical area or the\nindustry in which the investee\noperates; \u2022 a bona fide offer\nto purchase, an offer by the\ninvestee to sell or a\ncompleted auction process for\nthe same or similar investment\nfor an amount less than the\ncarrying amount of that\ninvestment; and \u2022 factors that\nraise significant concerns\nabout the investee\u2019s ability\nto continue as a going\nconcern, such as negative cash\nflows from operations, working\ncapital deficiencies or\nnoncompliance with statutory\ncapital requirements or debt\ncovenants. When the\nqualitative assessment\nindicates that impairment\nexists, the investment is\nwritten down to fair value,\nwith the full difference\nbetween the fair value of the\ninvestment and its carrying\namount recognized in earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                     June 30, 2020               2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value           $            771    $           700  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026          Three                                   Six  \n  of              Months                                Months  \n  dollars          Ended                                 Ended  \n  Measur\u2026       June 30,                              June 30,  \n  altern\u2026           2020       2019       2020            2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impair\u2026    $        50    $     3    $    53    $          8  \n  losses                                                        \n  Downwa\u2026                                                       \n  changes                                                       \n  for                 19         12         19              12  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n  Upward                                                        \n  changes                                                       \n  for                 17         19         42              85  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on these nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                         June 30, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                           65  \n  Downward changes for                                      52  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       384  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \n                              135                               \nA similar impairment analysis is performed for non-marketable\nequity securities carried at cost.

Investments in Alternative Investment Funds That Calculate\nNet Asset Value The Company holds investments in certain\nalternative investment funds that calculate net asset value\n(NAV), or its equivalent, including private equity funds, funds\nof funds and real estate funds, as provided by third-party asset\nmanagers. Investments in such funds are generally classified as\nnon-marketable equity securities carried at fair value.

Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectable may be\nrecorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already\nbeen recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is\nrequired at the time of the modification.\n(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest\npayments may involve a below-market interest rate.\n                              149                               \nThe following table presents total corporate loans modified in a\nTDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the\npayment default occurred within one yearof a permanent\nmodification.

for\nfurther discussion on the impact of Citi\u2019s adoption of CECL.\n(2) Recoveries have been reduced by certain collection costs\nthat are incurred only if collection efforts are successful.\n(3) During the second quarter of 2020, Citi updated its ACLL\nestimate of lifetime credit losses resulting from a change in\naccounting for variable post-charge-off third-party agency\ncollection costs in its U.S. Consumer businesses. After June 30,\n2020, these costs will be recorded as operating expenses for\nfuture periods as they are incurred. The impact of this change\nin estimate effected by a change in accounting principle\nresulted in an approximate $ 426million reduction in Citi's\nestimated ACLL at June 30, 2020.\n(4) Represents additional credit loss reserves for unfunded\nlending commitments and letters of credit recorded in Other\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(5) At June 30, 2020, the Corporate ACLUC includes a non-\nprovision transfer of $ 68million, representing reserves on\nperformance guarantees as of March 31, 2020. The reserves on\nthese contracts have been reclassified out of the allowance for\ncredit losses on unfunded lending commitments and into other\nliabilities as of June 30, 2020.\n(6) Primarily related to consumer. The corporate allowance is\npredominantly sourced in U.S. dollars.\n                              151                               \nAllowance for Credit Losses and End-of-Period Loans\n

See Note 3\nfor further information on business segments. During the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2020, Citi qualitatively assessed\nthe current environment, including the estimated impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic variables and economic\nforecasts and how those might impact the fair value of reporting\nunits. After consideration of the items above, the first and\nsecond quarter 2020 results, the results of the 2019 impairment\ntest and latest available management forecasts, Citi determined\nit was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of any\nreporting unit was below its book value as of June 30, 2020.

See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 70.4and $ 69billion in\nunconsolidated VIE assets and $ 710and$ 711million in maximum\nexposure to loss as of 6/30/20 and 12/31/19 respectively.\n                              164                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $\n52.4billion and $ 52.5billion, respectively. (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K); \u2022\ncertain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company\nholds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on\narm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities held by the Company, which are classified as\nTrading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has\nno other involvement with the related securitization entity\ndeemed to be significant (for more information on these\npositions, see Notes 13 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements); \u2022 certain representations and warranties exposures\nin legacy ICG -sponsored mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecuritizations in which the Company has no variable interest or\ncontinuing involvement as servicer. The outstanding balance of\nmortgage loans securitized during 2005 to 2008 in which the\nCompany has no variable interest or continuing involvement as\nservicer was approximately $ 6billion and $ 6billion at June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively; \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have\na variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the legal form of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the Company\u2019s standard accounting policies for the\nasset type and line of business. The asset balances for\nunconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant\ninvolvement represent the most current information available to\nthe Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an\namortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair\nvalue information is readily available to the Company. The\nmaximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying\namount of the Company\u2019s investment in the VIE. It reflects the\ninitial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any\naccrued interest and cash principal payments received. The\ncarrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines\nin fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings.\nThe maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the\nremaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and\ncredit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount\nof a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest.\nIn certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative\ninstruments or other arrangements that are not considered\nvariable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit\nprotection under a credit default swap or total return swap\nwhere the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the\nSPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in\nthe maximum exposure amounts.\n                              165                               \nFunding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated\nVIEs\u2014Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments\nThe following table presents the notional amount of liquidity\nfacilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding\ncommitments in the VIE tables above:\n                                                                \n                 June                                  Decemb\u2026  \n                  30,                                      31,  \n                 2020                                     2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  milli\u2026       Liqui\u2026       Loan/e\u2026       Liqui\u2026       Loan/e\u2026  \n  of           facil\u2026       commit\u2026       facil\u2026       commit\u2026  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Asset\u2026    $       \u2014    $   10,302    $       \u2014    $    9,524  \n  finan\u2026                                                        \n  Munic\u2026                                                        \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  tender                                                        \n  option        2,320             \u2014        3,544             \u2014  \n  bond                                                          \n  trusts                                                        \n  (TOBs)                                                        \n  Munic\u2026            \u2014         2,906            \u2014         3,034  \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  Inves\u2026            \u2014            15            \u2014            16  \n  funds                                                         \n  Other             \u2014            50            \u2014            39  \n  Total                                                         \n  fundi\u2026    $   2,320    $   13,273    $   3,544    $   12,613  \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of                                                \n  dollars                June 30, 2020       December 31, 2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash                $              \u2014    $                  \u2014  \n  Trading account                  2.1                     2.6  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                     10.0                     9.9  \n  Total loans, net                29.0                    26.7  \n  of allowance                                                  \n  Other                            0.5                     0.5  \n  Total assets        $           41.6    $               39.7  \n                                                                \nCredit Card Securitizations Substantially all of the Company\u2019s\ncredit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Master Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial\nmajority through the Master Trust.

In managing\nthis risk, Citigroup\neconomically hedges a\nsignificant portion of the\nvalue of its MSRs through the\nuse of interest rate\nderivative contracts, forward\npurchase and sale commitments\nof mortgage-backed securities\nand purchased securities, all\nclassified as Trading account\nassets .\n                              170                               \nThe Company receives fees\nduring the course of servicing\npreviously securitized\nmortgages.

Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the three months ended\nJune 30, 2020 and 2019. These\nsecurities are backed by\neither residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of\nclients. As of June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019, Citi\nheld noretained interests in\nprivate label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During\nthe three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2020, Citi\ntransferred agency securities\nwith a fair value of\napproximately $ 12billion and\n$ 19.4billion to re-\nsecuritization entities\ncompared to approximately $\n6.9billion and $ 14.5billion\nfor the three and six months\nended June 30, 2019. As of\nJune 30, 2020, the fair value\nof Citi-retained interests in\nagency re-securitization\ntransactions structured by\nCiti totaled approximately $\n1.8billion (including $\n858.7million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2020) compared to\n$ 2.2billion as of December\n31, 2019 (including $\n1.3billion related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2019), which is\nrecorded in Trading account\nassets . The original fair\nvalues of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 were\napproximately $ 71.8billion\nand $ 73.5billion,\nrespectively. As of June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019,\nthe Company did not\nconsolidate any private label\nor agency re-securitization\nentities.\n\nCiti-Administered Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Conduits At\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019, the commercial paper\nconduits administered by Citi\nhad approximately $ 16billion\nand $ 15.6billion of purchased\nassets outstanding,\nrespectively, and had\nincremental funding\ncommitments with clients of\napproximately $ 17.9billion\nand $ 16.3billion,\nrespectively. Substantially\nall of the funding of the\nconduits is in the form of\nshort-term commercial paper.\nAt June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, the weighted average\nremaining lives of the\ncommercial paper issued by the\nconduits were approximately\n52and 49days, respectively.\nThe primary credit enhancement\nprovided to the conduit\ninvestors is in the form of\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancements described above.\nIn addition to the\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancements, the conduits,\nother than the government\nguaranteed loan conduit, have\nobtained a letter of credit\nfrom the Company, which is\nequal to at least 8% to 10% of\nthe conduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The\nletters of credit provided by\nthe Company to the conduits\ntotal approximately $\n1.5billion and $ 1.4billion as\nof June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, respectively. The\nnet result across multi-seller\nconduits administered by the\nCompany is that, in the event\nthat defaulted assets exceed\nthe transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements described\nabove, any losses in each\nconduit are allocated first to\nthe Company and then to the\ncommercial paper investors.

Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from market\nfluctuations (i.e., market\nrisk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or\nperiods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e.,\nliquidity risk), as well as\nany market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n                              173

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              174                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of June\n30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against\ngross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to\nenforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. As a\nresult, the tables reflect a\nreduction of approximately $\n290billion and $ 180billion as\nof June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, respectively, of\nderivative assets and\nderivative liabilities that\npreviously would have been\nreported on a gross basis, but\nare now legally settled and\nnot subject to collateral. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              175

For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\nCitigroup has executed a last-\nof-layer hedge, which permits\nan entity to hedge the\ninterest rate risk of a stated\nportion of a closed portfolio\nof prepayable financial assets\nthat are expected to remain\noutstanding for the designated\ntenor of the hedge. In\naccordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment\nrisk when measuring the change\nin fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk under the last-of-\nlayer approach. Similar to\nother fair value hedges, where\nthe hedged item is an asset,\nthe fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk will be presented in\nInterest revenue along with\nthe change in the fair value\nof the hedging instrument.\n\nHedging of Foreign Exchange\nRisk Citigroup hedges the\nchange in fair value\nattributable to foreign\nexchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt\nthat are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the\nentity holding the securities\nor issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nCitigroup considers the\npremium associated with\nforward contracts (i.e., the\ndifferential between the spot\nand contractual forward rates)\nas the cost of hedging; this\namount is excluded from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally\nreflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge.\nCiti also excludes changes in\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the value\nof the hedged inventory is\nreflected in earnings, which\noffsets the change in the fair\nvalue of the futures contract\nthat is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedging instrument recorded in\nearnings includes changes in\nforward rates, Citigroup\nexcludes the differential\nbetween the spot and the\ncontractual forward rates\nunder the futures contract\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and it is\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in forward rates from\nthe assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income.\n                              178                               \nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the\nCompany\u2019s fair value hedges:\n                                                                \n        \u2026                                                       \n        \u2026                                                       \n        \u2026                                                       \n        \u2026                                                       \n        \u2026                                                       \n        \u2026                                                       \n        \u2026                                                \u2026      \n        \u2026                                                \u2026      \n        \u2026                                                \u2026      \n        \u2026                                                \u2026      \n        \u2026                    \u2026                           \u2026      \n        \u2026      \u2026             \u2026             \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \n        \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \n        \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n        \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \n        \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \n        \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \n        \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \n                                                                \n        \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \n        \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \n        \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \n        \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \n                                                                \n        \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \n        \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \n        \u2026      \u2014      5      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \u2026      \u2014      \n        \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \u2026      \n                                                                \n(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are\nincluded in Interest income/Interest expense .

These cash flow hedging relationships\nuse either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis\nto assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective\nat inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of June 30, 2020 is\napproximately $ 1.1billion. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10years. The pretax\nchange in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below.

Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives Certain\nderivative instruments contain provisions that require the\nCompany to either post additional collateral or immediately\nsettle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of\na specified event related to the credit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are defined by the existing derivative\ncontracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the\nCompany and its affiliates. The fair value (excluding CVA) of\nall derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net liability position at both June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 was $ 29billion and $ 30billion,\nrespectively. The Company posted $ 25billion and $ 28billion as\ncollateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as\nof June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch\nby all threemajor rating agencies as of June 30, 2020, the\nCompany could be required to post an additional $ 0.8billion as\neither collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could be required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians collateral previously received from\nexisting derivative counterparties in the amount of $ 0.2billion\nupon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral requirements of approximately $\n1billion. Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers\nFor transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the\nCompany and for which the Company has retained substantially all\nof the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed with the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), both\nthe asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of derecognition were $ 2.8billion and $\n5.8billion as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively. At June 30, 2020, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets was $ 2.8billion. The fair value\nof the total return swaps as of June 30, 2020 was $ 90million\nrecorded as gross derivative assets and $ 16million recorded as\ngross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2019, the fair\nvalue of these previously derecognized assets was $ 5.9billion,\nand the fair value of the total return swaps was $ 117million\nrecorded as gross derivative assets and $ 43million recorded as\ngross derivative liabilities. The balances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis, before the application of\ncounterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included\nprimarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in\nthis Note.\n                              183                               \n20.

Financial Statements\nin Citi\u2019s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nFair Value Hierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs\nbased on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are developed using market data and reflect\nmarket participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs\nreflect the Company\u2019s market assumptions. These two types of\ninputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level\n1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active and model-derived valuations in\nwhich all significant inputs and significant value drivers are\nobservable in active markets. \u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable . As required under\nthe fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and\nobservable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The\nfrequency of transactions, the size of the bid-ask spread and\nthe amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar\ntransactions are all factors in determining the relevance of\nobserved prices in those markets.\n                              184                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The\nCompany may hedge positions that have been classified in the\nLevel 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging\ninstruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with\nfinancial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.

lock\ncommitments for those loans that have been originated and\nelected under the fair value option.\n(2) Includes DVA that is included in AOCI . See Notes 17 and 20\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                              204                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . Among other\nvariables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and\nsimilar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of\nthe Company\u2019s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair\nvalue of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in\nthe Company\u2019s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit\nrisk) were a loss of $ 2,935million and a gain of $ 3million for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and a gain of $\n1,253million and a loss of $ 722million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in fair value\nresulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were\nestimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit spreads\nobservable in the bond market into the relevant valuation\ntechnique used to value each liability as described above. The\nFair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nSelected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to\nResell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to\nRepurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized\nShort-Term Borrowings The Company elected the fair value option\nfor certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased\nunder agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities\nloaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held\nprimarily by broker-dealer entities in the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the election was made\nbecause the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio\nbasis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are\naccounted for at fair value through earnings. Changes in fair\nvalue for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in\nPrincipal transactions . The related interest revenue and\ninterest expense are measured based on the contractual rates\nspecified in the transactions and are reported as Interest\nrevenue and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Certain Loans and Other Credit Products Citigroup has\nalso elected the fair value option for certain other originated\nand purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products,\nsuch as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by\nCitigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses. None of these credit\nproducts are highly leveraged financing commitments. Significant\ngroups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products\nthat are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near\nterm, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with\nderivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps\nor total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on\nthe underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the\nfair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases\nwhere hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending\ntransactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n

$\n1,062million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Changes in\nthe fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are\nclassified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and\n2019 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a loss of\n$( 40) million and a gain of $ 53million, respectively. Certain\nInvestments in Unallocated Precious Metals Citigroup invests in\nunallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver, platinum and\npalladium) as part of its commodity and foreign currency trading\nactivities or to economically hedge certain exposures from\nissuing structured liabilities. Under ASC 815, the investment is\nbifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity forward\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the debt host contract\nwithin Trading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts\nacross unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $\n0.5billion and $ 0.2billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019, respectively. The amounts are expected to fluctuate based\non trading activity in future periods. As part of its commodity\nand foreign currency trading activities, Citi trades unallocated\nprecious metals investments and executes forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties.\nWhen Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment,\nCiti\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of June\n30, 2020, there were approximately $ 10.6billion and $\n8.0billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures\nCitigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for\nthe purpose of earning investment returns and for capital\nappreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for\ncertain of these ventures, because such investments are\nconsidered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)\nCitigroup has elected the fair value option for certain\npurchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming\nadjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are\nintended for sale or securitization and are hedged with\nderivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value\noption to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge\naccounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.\nThe following table provides information about certain mortgage\nloans HFS carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of              June 30,                          \n  dollars                         2020       December 31, 2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the          $       950    $              1,254  \n  Consolidated Balance                                          \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggregate fair value                                          \n  in excess of (less                48                     -31  \n  than) unpaid                                                  \n  principal balance                                             \n  Balance of                                                    \n  non-accrual loans or                                          \n  loans                              \u2014                       1  \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past due                                                      \n  Aggregate unpaid                                              \n  principal balance in                                          \n  excess of fair value                                          \n  for non-accrual                    \u2014                       \u2014  \n  loans or loans more                                           \n  than 90 days past                                             \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              206                               \nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are\nreported in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. There was no net change in fair value\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk. Related interest income\ncontinues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates\nand reported as Interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement\nof Income. Certain Structured Liabilities The Company has\nelected the fair value option for certain structured liabilities\nwhose performance is linked to structured interest rates,\ninflation, currency, equity, referenced credit or commodity\nrisks. The Company elected the fair value option because these\nexposures are considered to be trading-related positions and,\ntherefore, are managed on a fair value basis.

For certain\ncontracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties.

lending indemnifications\nand credit card merchant processing were not material for either\nperiod presented, as the probability of potential liabilities\narising from these guarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be $ 82billion and $\n92billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum\nexposure is not representative of the actual potential loss\nexposure based on its historical experience. This contingent\nliability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services\nare delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items\nare returned to merchants.\n                              208                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the seller taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 32million and $ 37million at June\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and these amounts\nare included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in certain\nof its credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to\nthe partner regarding the volume of certain customer\noriginations during the term of the agreement. To the extent\nthat such origination targets are not met, the guarantees serve\nto compensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise\nwould have been generated in connection with such originations.\nOther Guarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection\nPrograms Citi, through its credit card businesses, provides\nvarious cardholder protection programs on several of its card\nproducts, including programs that provide insurance coverage for\nrental cars, coverage for certain losses associated with\npurchased products, price protection for certain purchases and\nprotection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not included\nin the table, since the total outstanding amount of the\nguarantees and Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be\nquantified. The protection is limited to certain types of\npurchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the\npurchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given\ntime. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential\nliability related to these programs based on the extent and\nnature of its historical loss experience. At June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, the actual and estimated losses incurred and\nthe carrying value of Citi\u2019s obligations related to these\nprograms were immaterial. Value-Transfer Networks (Including\nExchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or\nshareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs)\n(payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges)\naround the world. As a condition of membership, many of these\nVTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of\nthe losses incurred by the organization due to another member\u2019s\ndefault on its obligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be\nlimited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions\nto the VTN\u2019s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro\nrata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as\nthis would require an assessment of claims that have not yet\noccurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote\ngiven historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of June 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification\nIn 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary\nof Citi, entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the\nrisks and rewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE\nLife (now Genworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a\nsubsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE). As part of this\ntransaction, the reinsurance obligations were provided by two\nregulated insurance subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two\ncollateral trusts with securities. Presently, as discussed\nbelow, the trusts are referred to as the Genworth Trusts. As\npart of GE\u2019s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks\nand rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance\nagreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth\nthrough GE\u2019s Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC)\nsubsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition,\nGE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC\nthat is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay\nits reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance\nagreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has\nreinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has\nreinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC\npolicies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations\nnow benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While\nneither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the\ncapital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse\nand Citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital\nmaintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will\ncontinue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance\nobligations to Genworth. In connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of\nTravelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an\nindemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder\nclaims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the\nTravelers LTC policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by\nsubsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail\ninsurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers\nLTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original\nreinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and\nGenworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole\nbeneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are\ndesigned to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal\nto the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the\nTravelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are\nevaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair\nvalue of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount\nequal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the\nliabilities change over time.\n                              209                               \nIf both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original\nTravelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason,\nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the\ntwoGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 related to this indemnification. However,\nif both events become reasonably possible (meaning more than\nremote but less than probable), Citi will be required to\nestimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of\nloss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In\naddition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required\nto accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable\naccounting principles. Citi continues to closely monitor its\npotential exposure under this indemnification obligation, given\nGE\u2019s 2018 LTC and other charges and the September 2019 AM Best\ncredit ratings downgrade for the Genworth subsidiaries.\nSeparately, Genworth announced that it had agreed to be\npurchased by China Oceanwide Holdings Co., Ltd, subject to a\nseries of conditions and regulatory approvals. Citi is\nmonitoring these developments. Futures and Over-the-Counter\nDerivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on central\nclearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-\ntraded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts with\nCCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has\nconcluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in\nits role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 19 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually\nagreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the\nclient all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions\non the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right\nas a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets,\n(iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client\nfor the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and\n(iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin\ncollected and remitted in this manner was approximately $\n17.5billion and $ 13.3billion as of June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, respectively. Variation margin due from clients to the\nrespective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in\nthe value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts for each trading\nday. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-\nperformance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post\nvariation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of\nthe client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of non-\nperformance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event the\nclient fails to perform. As required by ASC 860-30-25-5,\nsecurities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying Value\u2014Guarantees and\nIndemnifications At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the\ntotal carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the\nguarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above\namounted to approximately $ 3.7billion and $ 1.2billion,\nrespectively. The carrying value of financial and performance\nguarantees is included in Other liabilities . For loans sold\nwith recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included\nin Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral available to\nCiti to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and\nindemnifications amounted to $ 50.0billion and $ 46.7billion at\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Securities\nand other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $\n67.3billion and $ 58.6billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to\nreimburse losses realized under securities lending\nindemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of\nCiti held as collateral amounted to $ 3.8billion and $\n4.4billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nOther property may also be available to Citi to cover losses\nunder certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the\nvalue of such property has not been determined.\n                              210                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n

Unsettled Reverse\nRepurchase and Securities\nBorrowing Agreements and\nUnsettled Repurchase and\nSecurities Lending Agreements\nIn addition, in the normal\ncourse of business, Citigroup\nenters into reverse repurchase\nand securities borrowing\nagreements, as well as\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements, which\nsettle at a future date. At\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019, Citigroup had\napproximately $ 63.0billion\nand $ 34.0billion of unsettled\nreverse repurchase and\nsecurities borrowing\nagreements, and approximately\n$ 72.5billion and $\n38.7billion of unsettled\nrepurchase and securities\nlending agreements,\nrespectively.

Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible,\nCitigroup discloses the\nmatter. In addition, for such\nmatters, Citigroup discloses\nan estimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters as to which an\nestimate can be made. At June\n30, 2020, Citigroup\u2019s estimate\nof the reasonably possible\nunaccrued loss for these\nmatters was approximately $\n1.2billion in the aggregate.\nAs available information\nchanges, the matters for which\nCitigroup is able to estimate\nwill change, and the estimates\nthemselves will change. In\naddition, while many estimates\npresented in financial\nstatements and other financial\ndisclosures involve\nsignificant judgment and may\nbe subject to significant\nuncertainty, estimates of the\nrange of reasonably possible\nloss arising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nhave only preliminary,\nincomplete, or inaccurate\ninformation about the facts\nunderlying the claim; its\nassumptions about the future\nrulings of the court or other\ntribunal on significant\nissues, or the behavior and\nincentives of adverse parties,\nregulators, or tax authorities\nmay prove to be wrong; and the\noutcomes it is attempting to\npredict are often not amenable\nto the use of statistical or\nother quantitative analytical\ntools. In addition, from time\nto time an outcome may occur\nthat Citigroup had not\naccounted for in its estimates\nbecause it had deemed such an\noutcome to be remote. For all\nthese reasons, the amount of\nloss in excess of accruals\nultimately incurred for the\nmatters as to which an\nestimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the range of loss\nincluded in the estimate.\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current legal\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of\n\nall matters described in this\nNote would not be likely to\nhave a material adverse effect\non the consolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters\ncould, from time to time, have\na material adverse effect on\nCitigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash\nflows in particular quarterly\nor annual periods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nCorporate Bonds Antitrust\nLitigation On April 21, 2020,\na complaint was filed against\nCitigroup, CGMI, and other\ndefendants in the United\nStates District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York,\nasserting that defendants\nviolated federal antitrust law\nby unreasonably restraining\nthe trade of odd-lots of\ncorporate bonds in the\nsecondary market.

There was no change to Citi\u2019s dividend\npolicy.\n\n(2) Citi\u2019s $17.1 billion 2019 common stock repurchase program\n(2019 Repurchase Program), which was approved by Citigroup\u2019s\nBoard of Directors and announced on June 27, 2019, expired on\nJune 30, 2020. The 2019 Repurchase Program was part of the\nplanned capital actions included by Citi as part of the 2019\nCCAR.\n\n(3) Consisted of shares added to treasury stock related to (i)\ncertain activity on employee stock option program exercises\nwhere the employee delivers existing shares to cover the option\nexercise, or (ii) under Citi\u2019s employee restricted share awards\nwhere shares are withheld to satisfy tax requirements.\n\nN/A Not applicable\n                                                                \n  Dividends                                                     \n                                                                \nConsistent with the regulatory\ncapital framework, Citi\ndeclared common dividends of\n$0.51 per share for the third\nquarter of 2020 on July 23,\n2020, and intends to maintain\nits planned capital actions,\nwhich include common dividends\nof $0.51 per share over the\nfour-quarter window of fourth\nquarter of 2020 to third\nquarter of 2021 (the 2020 CCAR\ncycle), subject to approval of\nCiti\u2019s Board of Directors and\nthe latest financial and\nmacroeconomic conditions. For\ninformation on Citi\u2019s interim\nSCB, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Stress Capital\nBuffer\u201d above.\n\nIn addition to Board of\nDirectors\u2019 approval, Citi\u2019s\nability to pay common stock\ndividends substantially\ndepends on the results of the\nCCAR process required by the\nFederal Reserve Board and the\nsupervisory stress tests\nrequired under the Dodd-Frank\nAct. In June 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board determined that\nchanges in financial markets\nand macroeconomic outlooks\nrelated to the COVID-19\npandemic could have a material\neffect on the risk profile and\nfinancial condition of each\nfirm subject to its capital\nplan rule, and therefore\nrequire updated capital plans.\nAccordingly, the Federal\nReserve Board is requiring\neach firm, including Citi, to\nupdate and resubmit its\ncapital plan within 45 days\nafter the Federal Reserve\nBoard provides updated\nscenarios.\n\nThrough the end of the third\nquarter of 2020, the Federal\nReserve Board has authorized\nfirms, including Citi, to pay\ncommon stock dividends that do\nnot exceed an amount equal to\nthe average of the firm\u2019s net\nincome for the four preceding\ncalendar quarters, unless\notherwise specified by the\nFederal Reserve Board,\nprovided that the firm does\nnot exceed the amount of\ncommon stock dividends paid in\nthe second quarter of 2020.\nCiti\u2019s common dividends of\n$0.51 per share during the\nthird quarter of 2020 is not\nimpacted by the Federal\nReserve Board\u2019s temporary\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions, as Citi\u2019s\naverage quarterly net income\nfor the four preceding\ncalendar quarters of $3.4\nbillion is more than\nsufficient under the four\nquarter average net income\ntest. For additional\ninformation on these capital\ndistribution limitations, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Capital\nPlan Resubmission and Related\nLimitations on Capital\nDistributions\u201d above.\n\nAny dividend on Citi\u2019s\noutstanding common stock would\nalso need to be made in\ncompliance with Citi\u2019s\nobligations on its outstanding\npreferred stock.\n\nFor information on the ability\nof Citigroup\u2019s subsidiary\ndepository institutions to pay\ndividends, see Note 18 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2019\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                              224                               \n                                                                \n                           SIGNATURES                           \n                                                                \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on\nits behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, on the\n4th day of August, 2020.\n                                                                \n                         CITIGROUP INC.                         \n                                                                \n                          (Registrant)                          \nBy /s/ Mark A.
