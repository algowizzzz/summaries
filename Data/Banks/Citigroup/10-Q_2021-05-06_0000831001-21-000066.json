Net income increased\nsignificantly, driven by the\nlower cost of credit.

Excluding the impact\nof FX translation, Citigroup\u2019s\nend-of-period deposits\nincreased 7%, primarily driven\nby 17% growth in GCB and 5%\ngrowth in ICG , reflecting\nconsistent client engagement\nand elevated levels of\nliquidity in the financial\nsystem.

Citi\u2019s net\nACL release of $3.9 billion\nprimarily reflected an\nimprovement in Citi\u2019s\nmacroeconomic outlook, as well\nas lower loan balances.

The\nincrease in the ratio\nreflected higher net income,\npartially offset by the return\nof capital to common\nshareholders and an increase\nin risk-weighted assets.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of March 31,\n2021 was 7.0%, compared to\n6.0% as of March 31, 2020. The\nincrease was primarily driven\nby a decrease in Total\nLeverage Exposure, reflecting\nthe benefit of temporary\nrelief granted by the Federal\nReserve Board.

GCB operating\nexpenses of $4.4 billion were\nlargely unchanged from the\nprior-year period. Excluding\nthe impact of FX translation,\nexpenses decreased 1%,\nprimarily driven by efficiency\nsavings and lower volume-\nrelated expenses, partially\noffset by investments.\n\nGCB revenues of $7.0 billion\ndecreased 14%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues decreased 15%, as\nstrong deposit growth and\nmomentum in wealth management\nwere more than offset by lower\ncard volumes and lower\ninterest rates across all\nregions, reflecting the\ncontinued impact of the\npandemic.\n\nNorth America GCB revenues of\n$4.4 billion decreased 15%,\nwith lower revenues across\nCiti-branded cards, Citi\nretail services and retail\nbanking, largely reflecting\nthe continued impact of the\npandemic. Citi-branded cards\nrevenues of $2.1 billion\ndecreased 11%, reflecting\nhigher payment rates driving\nlower average loans. Citi\nretail services revenues of\n$1.3 billion decreased 26%,\nprimarily driven by higher\npartner payments as well as\nlower average loans. Retail\nbanking revenues of $1.0\nbillion decreased 8%, as the\nbenefit of stronger deposit\nvolumes was more than offset\nby lower deposit spreads.\n\nYear-over-year, North America\nGCB average deposits of $197\nbillion increased 22%, average\nretail banking loans of $52\nbillion increased 3% and\nassets under management of $82\nbillion increased 32%. Average\nCiti-branded card loans of $79\nbillion decreased 15%, while\naverage Citi retail services\nloans of $44 billion decreased\n13%, both reflecting higher\npayment rates.

Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\ninternational GCB revenues\ndeclined 14%, largely\n\nreflecting the continued\nimpact of the pandemic. On\nthis basis, Latin America GCB\nrevenues declined 16%, driven\nby lower loan volumes and\nlower deposit spreads,\npartially offset by strong\ndeposit growth. Asia GCB\nrevenues decreased 12%, as\nlower card revenues and lower\ndeposit spreads were partially\noffset by higher investments\nrevenues and strong deposit\ngrowth.

On\nthis basis, international GCB\naverage card loans of $22\nbillion decreased 14% and card\npurchase sales of $24 billion\ndecreased 5%, both driven by\ncontinued lower customer\nactivity related to the\npandemic.\n                                                                \n  Institutional Clients Group                                   \n                                                                \nICG net income of $5.9 billion\nincreased 64%, driven by lower\ncost of credit, partially\noffset by higher expenses and\nlower revenues. ICG operating\nexpenses increased 8% to $6.3\nbillion, primarily driven by\ninvestments in infrastructure\nand controls as well as other\nstrategic investments, higher\ncompensation costs and volume-\ndriven growth, partially\noffset by efficiency savings.\n\nICG revenues of $12.2 billion\ndecreased 2%, reflecting a 7%\ndecrease in Banking revenues,\npartially offset by a 2%\nincrease in Markets and\nsecurities services revenues.\nThe decrease in Banking\nrevenues included the impact\nof $81 million of losses on\nloan hedges related to\ncorporate lending and the\nprivate bank, compared to\ngains of $816 million related\nto corporate lending and the\nprivate bank in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nExcluding the impact of gains\n(losses) on loan hedges,\nBanking revenues of $5.6\nbillion increased 9%, as\nhigher revenues in investment\nbanking, the private bank and\ncorporate lending were\npartially offset by a decline\nin treasury and trade\nsolutions. Investment banking\nrevenues of $2.0 billion\nincreased 46%, primarily\ndriven by strength in equity\nunderwriting and growth in\ndebt underwriting, partially\noffset by a decline in\nadvisory revenues. Advisory\nrevenues decreased 27% to $281\nmillion, equity underwriting\nrevenues increased\nsignificantly to $876 million\nand debt underwriting revenues\nincreased 4% to $816 million.\n\nTreasury and trade solutions\nrevenues of $2.2 billion\ndeclined 11%, or 10% excluding\nthe impact of FX translation,\nas good client engagement and\ngrowth in deposits were more\nthan offset by the impact of\nlower USD and non-USD interest\nrates and reduced commercial\ncards spend. Private bank\nrevenues increased 1% to $1.0\nbillion. Excluding the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges, private bank revenues\nincreased 8%, driven by higher\nloan volumes and spreads, as\nwell as higher deposit volumes\nand managed investments\nrevenue, partially offset by\nlower deposit spreads\nreflecting the impact of lower\ninterest rates.

Fixed\nincome markets revenues of\n$4.6 billion decreased 5%,\nprimarily reflecting strength\nin rates and currencies in the\nprior-year period, partially\noffset by higher revenues in\nspread products. Equity\nmarkets revenues of $1.5\nbillion increased 26%, driven\nby strength in cash equities,\nderivatives and prime finance,\nreflecting solid client\nactivity and favorable market\nconditions. Securities\nservices revenues of $653\nmillion increased 1%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, securities\nservices revenues were\nunchanged, as growth in\ndeposit volumes, assets under\ncustody and settlement volumes\nwas offset by lower deposit\nspreads, given lower interest\nrates.

Operating\nexpenses of $413 million\ndeclined 1%, as investments in\ninfrastructure, risk and\ncontrols were largely offset\nby the allocation of certain\ncosts to GCB and ICG . (For\nadditional information about\nthese cost allocations, see\nNote 3 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.)\n\nCorporate/Other revenues of\n$70 million declined from $73\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, as the impact of lower\ninterest rates was offset by\nthe absence of marks versus\nthe prior-year period, as well\nas episodic gains in the\ncurrent quarter.

post-charge-off\nthird-party collection costs from a \u201cchange in accounting\nestimate effected by a change in accounting principle\u201d to a\n\u201cchange in accounting principle,\u201d which required an adjustment\nto January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020\nnet income. As a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and quarterly results\nfor 2020 were revised to reflect this change as if it were\neffective as of January 1, 2020, as follows: an increase to\nbeginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $330 million\nand a decrease of $443 million in the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans, as well as a $113 million decrease in other\nassets related to income taxes; a decrease of $18 million to\nprovisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and\nincreases of $339 million and $122 million to provisions for\ncredit losses on loans in the second and third quarters,\nrespectively; and increases in operating expenses of $49 million\nand $45 million with a corresponding decrease in net credit\nlosses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. See Note\n1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation.\n\n(2) Certain series of preferred stock have semi-annual payment\ndates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n(3) The return on average common stockholders\u2019 equity is\ncalculated using net income less preferred stock dividends\ndivided by average common stockholders\u2019 equity. The return on\naverage total Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity is calculated using\nnet income divided by average Citigroup stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\n(4) RoTCE and TBV are non-GAAP financial measures. For\ninformation on RoTCE and TBV, see \u201cCapital Resources\u2014Tangible\nCommon Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per\nShare and Return on Equity\u201d below.\n\n(5) Citi\u2019s reportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1\nCapital and Total Capital as of March 31, 2021 and March 31,\n2020 were derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches\nframeworks.\n\n(6) Dividend payout ratio is calculated as dividends declared\nper common share as a percentage of net income per diluted\nshare.\n\n(7) Total payout ratio is calculated as total common dividends\ndeclared plus common share repurchases as a percentage of net\nincome available to common shareholders ( Net income , less\npreferred dividends).

reflecting\nsignificantly lower cost of\ncredit and lower expenses,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues.\n\nRevenues decreased 15%,\nreflecting lower revenues in\nCiti retail services, Citi-\nbranded cards and retail\nbanking, primarily reflecting\nthe continued impact of the\npandemic, including lower\ninterest rates.\n\nRetail banking revenues\ndecreased 8%, as the benefit\nof stronger deposit volumes\nand growth in assets under\nmanagement (increase of 32%)\nwas more than offset by lower\ndeposit spreads, reflecting\nlower interest rates. Average\ndeposits increased 22%, driven\nby government stimulus\npayments and a reduction in\noverall consumer spending\nrelated to the pandemic, as\nwell as continued strategic\nefforts to drive organic\ngrowth.\n\nCards revenues decreased 17%.\nCiti-branded cards revenues\ndecreased 11%, primarily\nreflecting lower average loans\n(decline of 15%), driven by\nhigher payment rates,\nreflecting increased customer\nliquidity from government\nstimulus. Purchase sales were\nlargely unchanged, reflecting\na continued recovery in sales\nactivity.\n\nCiti retail services revenues\ndecreased 26%, primarily\ndriven by higher contractual\npartner payments, reflecting\nhigher income sharing as a\nresult of lower forecasted\nlosses, as well as lower\naverage loans. (For additional\ninformation on partner\npayments, see Note 5 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.) Average loans\nwere down 13%, reflecting\nhigher payment rates, driven\nby the increased customer\nliquidity. Purchase sales\nincreased 4%, reflecting a\ncontinued recovery in sales\nactivity.\n\nExpenses decreased 4%,\nprimarily driven by lower\nmarketing costs and volume-\nrelated expenses, partially\noffset by investments.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $465 million in the first\nquarter of 2021 compared to\ncosts of $3.9 billion in the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by a net ACL release in\nthe current period compared to\na net ACL build in the prior-\nyear period, as well as lower\nnet credit losses. Net credit\nlosses decreased 36%,\ncomprised of lower net credit\nlosses in Citi retail services\n(down 44% to $373 million) and\nCiti-branded cards (down 29%\nto $551 million), primarily\nreflecting lower loan volumes\nand improved delinquencies,\ndue to the benefits of relief\nprograms, higher levels of\nliquidity and lower overall\ncustomer spending activity.\n\nThe net ACL release in the\nfirst quarter was $1.4 billion\n(compared to a build of $2.4\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod), reflecting lower loan\nvolumes, as well as the impact\nof Citi\u2019s improved\nmacroeconomic outlook.

Average deposits\nincreased 9%, while average\nloans decreased 13%,\nreflecting the impact of the\npandemic on customer activity,\nas well as the ongoing\neconomic slowdown. Assets\nunder management increased\n17%, including the continued\nbenefit of market movements,\nas well as improved client\nengagement.\n\nCards revenues decreased 32%,\nprimarily driven by lower\npurchase sales (down 8%) and\nlower average loans (down\n17%), reflecting the continued\nimpact of the pandemic on\ncustomer activity and the\nongoing economic slowdown.\n\nExpenses decreased 1%, as\nefficiency savings more than\noffset investments.\n\nProvisions decreased 57%,\nprimarily driven by a net ACL\nrelease compared to a net ACL\nbuild in the prior-year\nperiod, partially offset by\nhigher net credit losses. Net\ncredit losses increased 34%,\ndriven by the expiration of\nconsumer relief programs and\nthe continued adverse\npandemic-related macroeconomic\nimpacts in Mexico.\n\nThe net ACL release in the\nfirst quarter was $163\nmillion, compared to a build\nof $256 million in the prior-\nyear period. The release\nreflected Citi\u2019s improved\nmacroeconomic outlook, as well\nas lower loan volumes.

Net\ncredit losses increased 46%,\ndriven by the expiration of\nconsumer relief programs and\nthe continued adverse\npandemic-related macroeconomic\nimpacts in the region.\n\nThe net ACL release in the\nfirst quarter was $226\nmillion, compared to a build\nof $194 million in the prior-\nyear period.\n\nThe release reflected Citi\u2019s\nimproved macroeconomic\noutlook.

Excluding the impact of\ngains/(losses) on loan hedges,\nBanking revenues were up 9%,\ndriven by higher revenues in\ninvestment banking, corporate\nlending and the private bank,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in treasury and trade\nsolutions. Markets and\nsecurities services revenues\nwere up 2%, reflecting higher\nrevenues in equity markets,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in fixed income\nmarkets.\n\nCiti expects that revenues in\nits markets and investment\nbanking businesses will likely\ncontinue to reflect the\noverall market environment in\nthe near term.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nwere up 46%, reflecting growth\nin overall market wallet as\nwell as gains in wallet share,\nparticularly in equity\nunderwriting. Advisory\nrevenues decreased 27%,\nlargely reflecting a decline\nin wallet share, driven by\nNorth America , partially\noffset by EMEA . Equity\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased significantly,\ndriven by continued strength\nin the market wallet as well\nas wallet share gains, with\ngrowth in all regions. The\nincrease in equity\nunderwriting also reflected\nhigher underwriting activity\nfor special purpose\nacquisition companies (SPAC).\nDebt underwriting revenues\nincreased 4%, reflecting\nstrength in EMEA , Asia and\nLatin America , largely driven\nby the higher market wallet,\npartially offset by a decline\nin wallet share.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 11%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, revenues declined\n10%, reflecting declines in\nall regions. The decline in\nrevenues was driven by the\ncash business, reflecting the\ncontinued impact of lower USD\nand non-USD interest rates and\na slowdown in commercial cards\nspend both due to the\ncontinued impact of the\npandemic, partially offset by\nstrong deposit volumes.\nAverage deposit balances\nincreased 16% (14% excluding\nthe impact of FX translation),\ndue to strong client\nengagement and an elevated\nlevel of liquidity in the\nfinancial system. In trade,\nrevenues were largely\nunchanged, as a decline in\nloans, driven by continued\nsoftness in underlying trade\nflows\n\ndue to the pandemic, was\noffset by improved loan\nspreads.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\ndecreased 66%, including the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, primarily driven\nby the widening of credit\nspreads in the prior-year\nperiod, reflecting market\nvolatility related to the\npandemic. Excluding the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges, revenues increased 8%,\nprimarily due to the absence\nof marks on the portfolio\ndriven by the elevated market\nvolatility related to the\npandemic in the prior-year\nperiod. The increase was\npartially offset by lower\naverage loan volumes,\nreflecting paydowns on draws\nin 2020 and continued weakness\nin demand given stronger\nclient liquidity positions.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 1%. Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, revenues\nincreased 8%, reflecting\ngrowth across all regions. The\nincrease was driven by higher\nloan volumes and spreads, as\nwell as higher deposit volumes\nand managed investments\nrevenue, all driven by\ncontinued client activity,\npartially offset by lower\ndeposit spreads due to the\nongoing low interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues decreased 5%, as\ngrowth in North America and\nEMEA were more than offset by\ndeclines in Asia and Latin\nAmerica , reflecting a strong\nperformance in rates and\ncurrencies in the prior-year\nperiod. Non-interest revenues\ndecreased, reflecting lower\ncorporate and investor\nactivity in rates and\ncurrencies, partially offset\nby higher activity in spread\nproducts. Net interest\nrevenues also decreased,\nlargely reflecting a change in\nthe mix of trading positions.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\ndecreased 25%, primarily\nreflecting the strong\nperformance in the prior-year\nperiod, particularly in G10\nrates and currencies, driven\nby record volatility related\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nSpread products and other\nfixed income revenues\nincreased significantly,\nreflecting strong client\nactivity, as clients searched\nfor yield in a low-rate\nenvironment, with steady\ndemand across flow trading and\nstructured products.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 26%, driven by\ngrowth across all products.\nCash equities revenues\nincreased, reflecting elevated\nlevels of client activity as\nwell as favorable market\nconditions, particularly in\nNorth America and Asia .\nEquity derivatives revenues\nincreased, due to strong\nclient activity and favorable\nmarket\n                               20                               \nconditions, particularly in\nNorth America . The increase\nin prime finance revenues was\nlargely due to higher client\nbalances as well as favorable\nmarket conditions. Non-\ninterest revenues increased,\nprimarily driven by higher\nprincipal transactions and\ncommissions and fee revenues,\nprimarily due to the higher\nclient activity.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 1%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues were unchanged, as an\nincrease in fee revenues,\ndriven by growth in assets\nunder custody and settlement\nvolumes as well as higher\ndeposit volumes, was offset by\nlower deposit spreads due to\nthe continued low interest\nrate environment.\n\nFor additional information on\ntrends in ICG \u2019s deposit and\nloans, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Liquidity Risk\u2014Loans\u201d and\n\u201c\u2014Deposits\u201d below.\n\nExpenses were up 8%,\nreflecting continued\ninvestments in infrastructure\nand controls, as well as other\nstrategic investments, higher\ncompensation costs and volume-\ndriven growth, partially\noffset by efficiency savings.\n\nProvisions for the quarter\nreflected a net benefit of\n$1.8 billion, driven by an ACL\nrelease, partially offset by\nhigher net credit losses of\n$186 million, compared to $127\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\nThe ACL release for the\nquarter was $1.9 billion,\ncompared to a build of $1.9\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod.

If firms,\nincluding Citi, remain above\nall of their minimum risk-\nbased requirements in the 2021\nCCAR, the temporary\nlimitations on capital\ndistributions will end after\nJune 30 and those firms will\nbe subject to the normal\nStress Capital Buffer\nframework. However, if firms,\nincluding Citi, fall below any\nof their minimum risk-based\ncapital requirements in the\n2021 CCAR, those firms will\nremain subject to the\ntemporary limitations on\ncapital distributions for an\nadditional three months\nthrough September 30, 2021.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2021\nand onward, unless the Federal\nReserve Board further extends\nthe temporary limitations on\ncapital distributions, Citi\nand all other firms would be\nauthorized to make\ndistributions consistent with\ntheir Stress Capital Buffer\nrequirements.\n                               23

For the ongoing impact\nof CECL, Citigroup is allowed\nto adjust retained earnings\nand the allowance for credit\nlosses in an amount equal to\n25% of the change in the\nallowance for credit losses\n(pretax) for each period\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The\ncumulative adjustments to\nretained earnings and the\nallowance for credit losses\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital\nat 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related\nto the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding\nadjustments to average on-\nbalance sheet assets are\nreflected in quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nand Total Leverage Exposure.\nIn addition, the increase in\nDTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences upon the January\n1, 2020 adoption date has been\ndeducted from risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and will phase in\nto RWA at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022.\n\n(3) Citi\u2019s reportable Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1\nCapital and Total Capital\nratios were derived under the\nBasel III Advanced Approaches\nframework as of March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020.\n\n(4) Tier 1 Leverage ratio\ndenominator.

Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the\nallowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the\nongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained\nearnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal\nto 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax)\nfor each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021.\nThe cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the\nallowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December\n31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per\nyear commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts\nrelated to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.\n\n(3) Includes goodwill \u201cembedded\u201d in the valuation of significant\ncommon stock investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions.\n           Footnotes continue on the following page.            \n                                                                \n                               25                               \n(4) Of Citi\u2019s $24.2 billion of net DTAs at March 31, 2021, $14.4\nbillion was includable in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital pursuant\nto the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.8 billion was excluded.\nExcluded from Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of March\n31, 2021 was $11.7 billion of net DTAs arising from net\noperating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit\ntax carry-forwards. The amount excluded was reduced by $1.9\nbillion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible assets that are separately deducted\nfrom capital. DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required\nto be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under\nthe U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences are required to be deducted from capital only if\nthese DTAs exceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S. Basel III\nrules. Citi\u2019s DTAs do not currently exceed these limitations\nand, therefore, are not subject to deduction from Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting at 250%.\n\n(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the\nVolcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting\ncertain proprietary investment activities and limits their\nownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Commencing\nJanuary 1, 2021, Citi no longer deducts permitted market making\npositions in third-party covered funds from Tier 1 Capital, in\naccordance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0 issued by the U.S.\nagencies in November 2019. Upon the removal of the capital\ndeduction, permitted market making positions in third-party\ncovered funds are included in risk-weighted assets.\n\n(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the\nU.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased out of Tier 2\nCapital by January 1, 2022.\n\n(8) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach, in which the\nallowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any\nexcess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at\ncredit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of allowance for\ncredit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2\nCapital, subject to limitation, under the Standardized Approach\nframework was $14.4 billion and $14.0 billion at March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively.\n                               26                               \n                                                                \n

 \n(1) Citibank\u2019s effective minimum risk-based capital requirements\nare inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of\nwhich must be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital).\n\n(2) Citibank has elected to apply the modified transition\nprovision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard\non regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax),\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences\nand the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020\nCECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\nFor the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank is allowed to adjust\nretained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an\namount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit\nlosses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained\nearnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance\nsheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total\nassets and Total Leverage Exposure. In addition, the increase in\nDTAs arising from temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020\nadoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA)\nand will phase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1,\n2022.\n\n(3) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach in which the ACL is\neligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted in\narriving at credit risk-weighted assets.\n\n(4) Citibank\u2019s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches framework as of March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, whereas Citibank\u2019s reportable Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were the lower\nderived under the Basel III Standardized Approach framework for\nall periods presented.\n\n(5) Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of\n6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nregulations applicable to insured depository institutions as\nestablished by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also\nmaintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\n\n(6) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly\naverage total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n\n(7) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.

Risk\nratings and classifications\nare reviewed regularly, and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. This includes but\nis not limited to exposures in\nthose sectors significantly\nimpacted by the pandemic\n(including consumer retail,\ncommercial real estate and\ntransportation). Citigroup\nbelieves the corporate credit\nportfolio to be appropriately\nrated and classified as of\nMarch 31, 2021. Since the\nonset of the COVID-19\npandemic, Citigroup has taken\naction to adjust internal\nratings and classifications of\nexposures as both the\nmacroeconomic environment and\nobligor-specific factors have\nchanged, particularly where\nadditional stress has been\nseen. As obligor risk ratings\nare downgraded, the\nprobability of default\nincreases. Downgrades of\nobligor risk ratings tend to\nresult in a higher provision\nfor credit losses. In\naddition,\n                               44                               \ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other risk\nmitigants to hedge the\nincremental credit risk, or\nmay result in Citi\u2019s seeking\nto reduce exposure to an\nobligor or an industry sector.\nCiti will continue to review\nexposures to ensure that the\nappropriate probability of\ndefault is incorporated into\nall risk assessments.

At March 31, 2021,\nDecember 31, 2020 and March\n31, 2020, ICG (excluding the\ndelinquency-managed private\nbank portfolio) had economic\nhedges on the corporate credit\nportfolio of $38.8 billion,\n$38.8 billion and $33.0\nbillion, respectively.\nCitigroup\u2019s expected credit\nloss model used in the\ncalculation of its ACL does\nnot include the favorable\nimpact of credit derivatives\nand other mitigants that are\nmarked to market. In addition,\nthe reported amounts of direct\noutstandings and unfunded\nlending commitments in the\ntables above do not reflect\nthe impact of these hedging\ntransactions. The credit\nprotection was economically\nhedging underlying ICG\n(excluding the delinquency-\nmanaged private bank\nportfolio) corporate credit\nportfolio exposures with the\nfollowing risk rating\ndistribution: Rating of Hedged\nExposure\n                                                                \n                                   December                     \n                March 31,               31,       March 31,     \n                     2021              2020            2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  AAA/AA/A             32  %             30  %           32  %  \n  BBB                  47                48              52     \n  BB/B                 18                19              14     \n  CCC or                3                 3               2     \n  below                                                         \n  Total               100  %            100  %          100  %  \n                                                                \n                               49                               \n                                                                \n  ADDITIONAL CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CREDIT DETAILS              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Loans Outstanding                                             \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  m\u2026                                                            \n  of                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  C\u2026                                                            \n  l\u2026                                                            \n  In                                                            \n  N\u2026       1st        4th        3rd         2nd        1st     \n  A\u2026       Qt\u2026        Qt\u2026        Qt\u2026        Qtr.

The ASU\nintroduces a new credit loss methodology requiring earlier\nrecognition of credit losses while also providing additional\ntransparency about credit risk. On January 1, 2020, Citi\nrecorded a $4.1 billion, or an approximate 29%, pretax increase\nin the Allowance for credit losses, along with a $3.1 billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained earnings and a deferred tax asset\nincrease of $1.0 billion. This transition impact reflects (i) a\n$4.9 billion build to the consumer allowance for credit losses\ndue to longer estimated tenors for cards than under the incurred\nloss methodology under prior U.S. GAAP, net of recoveries; and\n(ii) a $(0.8) billion decrease to the corporate allowance for\n                               51                               \ncredit losses due to shorter remaining tenors, incorporation of\nrecoveries and use of more specific historical loss data based\non an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and\ngeographies. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further discussion on the impact of Citi\u2019s adoption of CECL.\n\n(2) Citi had a change in accounting related to its variable\npost-charge-off third-party collection costs that was recorded\nas an adjustment to its January 1, 2020 opening allowance for\ncredit losses on loans of $443 million. See Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\n(3) Includes all adjustments to the allowance for credit losses,\nsuch as changes in the allowance from acquisitions,\ndispositions, securitizations, FX translation, purchase\naccounting adjustments, etc.\n\n(4) The first quarter of 2021 includes a decrease of\napproximately $108 million related to FX translation.\n\n(5) The fourth quarter of 2020 includes an increase of\napproximately $376 million related to FX translation.\n\n(6) The third quarter of 2020 includes an increase of\napproximately $116 million related to FX translation.\n\n(7) The second quarter of 2020 includes an increase of\napproximately $88 million related to FX translation.\n\n(8) The first quarter of 2020 includes a decrease of\napproximately $483 million related to FX translation.\n\n(9) March 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June\n30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, exclude $7.5 billion, $6.9 billion,\n$5.5 billion, $5.8 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, of\nloans that are carried at fair value.\n\n(10) At June 30, 2020, the corporate ACLUC includes a non-\nprovision transfer of $68 million, representing reserves on\nperformance guarantees as of March 31, 2020.

Citigroup\u2019s HQLA\ndecreased quarter-over-\nquarter, primarily reflecting\na decrease in cash as Citi\noptimized its overall HQLA and\ndeployed liquidity. As of\nMarch 31, 2021, Citigroup had\napproximately $957 billion of\navailable liquidity resources\nto support client and business\nneeds, including end-of-period\nHQLA assets; additional\nunencumbered securities,\nincluding excess liquidity\nheld at bank entities that is\nnon-transferable to other\nentities within Citigroup; and\navailable assets not already\naccounted for within Citi\u2019s\nHQLA to support Federal Home\nLoan Bank (FHLB) and Federal\nReserve Bank discount window\nborrowing capacity.\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nMeasurement: Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio (LCR) In\naddition to internal 30-day\nliquidity stress testing\nperformed for Citi\u2019s major\nentities, operating\nsubsidiaries and countries,\nCiti also monitors its\nliquidity by reference to the\nLCR.

In\ngeneral, a bank\u2019s available\nstable funding will include\nportions of equity, deposits\nand long-term debt, while its\nrequired stable funding will\nbe based on the liquidity\ncharacteristics of its assets,\nderivatives and commitments.\nThe ratio of available stable\nfunding to required stable\nfunding will be required to be\ngreater than 100%.

End-of-period loans\ndeclined 8% year-over-year and\n1% quarter-over-quarter. On an\naverage basis, loans declined\n4% year-over-year and were\nunchanged sequentially.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, average loans\ndeclined 5% year-over-year and\n1% sequentially. On this\nbasis, average GCB loans\ndeclined 8% year-over-year,\nprimarily reflecting higher\npayment rates given high\nlevels of liquidity due to\nU.S. fiscal stimulus and the\nimpact of lower customer\nspending, primarily in Citi\u2019s\ncards businesses in Asia and\nMexico. Excluding the impact\nof FX translation, average ICG\nloans declined 3% year-over-\nyear. Loans in corporate\nlending declined 15% on an\naverage basis, reflecting net\nrepayments as Citi continued\nto assist its clients in\naccessing the capital markets,\nas well as lower demand.\nPrivate bank loans\n\nincreased 8%, largely driven\nby secured lending to high-\nnet-worth clients, including\nresidential real estate\nlending. TTS loans decreased\n8%, reflecting weakness in\nunderlying trade flows and the\ncontinued low level of spend\nin commercial cards driven by\nthe impact of the pandemic.\nAverage Corporate/Othe r loans\ncontinued to decline (down\n32%), driven by the wind-down\nof legacy assets.

On this\nbasis, average deposits in GCB\nincreased 18%, with strong\ngrowth across all regions.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, average deposits\nin ICG grew 15% year-over-\nyear, primarily driven by\ngrowth in TTS, as well as\ncontinued growth in the\nprivate bank and securities\nservices.\n                               58                               \nLong-Term Debt The weighted-\naverage maturity of unsecured\nlong-term debt issued by\nCitigroup and its affiliates\n(including Citibank) with a\nremaining life greater than\none year was approximately 8.9\nyears as of March 31, 2021,\ncompared to 9.0 years as of\nthe prior year and 8.6 years\nas of the prior quarter. The\nweighted-average maturity is\ncalculated based on the\ncontractual maturity of each\nsecurity. For securities that\nare redeemable prior to\nmaturity at the option of the\nholder, the weighted-average\nmaturity is calculated based\non the earliest date an option\nbecomes exercisable.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued\nto third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup)\nand Citi\u2019s non-bank\nsubsidiaries (including\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries)\nthat are consolidated into\nCitigroup. As of March 31,\n2021, non-bank included $55.7\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries, as\nwell as certain Citigroup\nconsolidated hedging\nactivities. (2) Local country\nand other includes debt issued\nby Citi\u2019s affiliates in\nsupport of their local\noperations. Within non-bank,\ncertain secured financing is\nalso included. (3)\nPredominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Citi-branded credit\ncard receivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\ndecreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by declines\nin unsecured benchmark senior\ndebt, FHLB borrowings and\nsecuritizations at the bank,\npartially offset by the\nissuance of unsecured\nbenchmark senior debt and\ncustomer-related debt at the\nnon-bank entities.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding decreased, driven\nprimarily by declines in\nunsecured benchmark senior\ndebt at the non-bank entities,\nas well as declines in\nunsecured benchmark senior\ndebt and securitizations at\nthe bank. As part of its\nliability management, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During the\nfirst quarter of 2021, Citi\nredeemed or repurchased an\naggregate of approximately\n$10.7 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               59

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n\nSecured Funding Transactions\n\nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $219\nbillion as of March 31, 2021\ndeclined 1% from the prior-\nyear period and increased 10%\nsequentially. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nsecured funding declined 6%\nfrom the prior-year period and\nincreased 12% sequentially,\nboth driven by normal business\nactivity. The average balance\nfor secured funding was\napproximately $235 billion for\nthe quarter ended March 31,\n2021.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nMarch 31, 2021.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $32 billion decreased 42%\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by a decline in FHLB\nadvances. Sequentially, short-\nterm borrowings increased by\n9%, driven by customer-related\ndebt issuance (see Note 16 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               61                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014 Liquidity Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $1.5 billion,\ncompared to $0.6 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020. Other\nfunding sources, such as\nsecured financing transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely affected.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.5\nbillion, compared to $0.4\nbillion as of December 31,\n2020. Other funding sources,\nsuch as secured funding\ntransactions and other margin\nrequirements, for which there\nare no explicit triggers,\ncould also be adversely\nimpacted.\n\nIn total, as of March 31,\n2021, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup and Citibank across\nall three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$1.9 billion, compared to $1.0\nbillion as of December 31,\n2020 (see also Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements). As detailed under\n\u201cHigh-Quality Liquid Assets\u201d\nabove, Citigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings at certain Citibank\nsubsidiaries. Mitigating\nactions available to Citibank\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, selling or financing\nhighly liquid government\nsecurities, tailoring levels\nof secured lending, adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nassets, reducing loan\noriginations and renewals,\nraising additional deposits or\nborrowing from the FHLB or\ncentral banks. Citi believes\nthese mitigating actions could\nsubstantially reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above.\n                               62                               \nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. As of\nMarch 31, 2021, Citibank had\nliquidity commitments of\napproximately $10.0 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\nunchanged from the prior\nquarter (for additional\ninformation, see Note 18 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients\u2019 adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               63                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk emanates from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(9) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof March 31, 2021.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nAs shown in the table above,\nCiti decreased its net\ninterest revenue exposure due\nto an increase in interest\nrates. The decrease was\npredominantly in U.S. dollar\nexposure, which was $102\nmillion as of March 31, 2021,\nprimarily driven by an\nincrease in investment\nsecurities.\n\nThe relatively small quarterly\nchange in the estimated impact\nto AOCI primarily reflected a\ncontinuation of the\npositioning strategy of Citi\nTreasury\u2019s investment\nsecurities and related\ninterest rate derivatives\nportfolio. In the event of a\nparallel instantaneous 100 bps\nincrease in interest rates,\nCiti expects that the negative\nimpact to AOCI would be offset\nin stockholders\u2019 equity\nthrough the expected recovery\nof the impact on AOCI through\naccretion of Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio over a period of\ntime. As of March 31, 2021,\nCiti expects that the negative\n$5.4 billion impact to AOCI in\nsuch a scenario could\npotentially be offset over\napproximately 35 months.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under five\ndifferent changes in interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and Citi\u2019s other\ncurrencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d). The rate\nscenarios are also impacted by\nconvexity related to mortgage\nproducts.\n\nIn addition, in the table\nbelow, the magnitude of the\nimpact to Citi\u2019s net interest\nrevenue and AOCI is greater\nunder Scenario 2 as compared\nto Scenario 3. This is because\nthe combination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  mi\u2026                                                           \n  of                                                            \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  ex\u2026                                                           \n  as                                                            \n  ot\u2026                                                           \n  no\u2026                                                           \n  Ov\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  10\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  ch\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  an\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to        Sce\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026       Sce\u2026       Scen\u2026  \n  net          1          2           3          4           5  \n  in\u2026        100        100           \u2014          \u2014       (100)  \n  re\u2026        100          \u2014         100       (10\u2026       (100)  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  U.\u2026    $   102    $   167    $     64    $  -264    $   -549  \n  do\u2026                                                           \n  All                                                           \n  ot\u2026        636        594          37        -37        -391  \n  cu\u2026                                                           \n  To\u2026    $   738    $   761    $    101    $  -301    $   -940  \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026    $  -5,\u2026    $  -3,\u2026    $  -2,3\u2026    $  1,8\u2026    $  3,301  \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to\u2026                                                           \n  Es\u2026                                                           \n  in\u2026                                                           \n  im\u2026                                                           \n  to                                                            \n  Co\u2026                                                           \n  Eq\u2026        -32        -20         -15         11          16  \n  Ti\u2026                                                           \n  1                                                             \n  Ca\u2026                                                           \n  ra\u2026                                                           \n  (b\u2026                                                           \n                                                                \nNote: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur\ninstantaneously.

This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nEuro and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency translation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the impact\nof these changes on Citi\u2019s TCE\nand Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

Buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss excludes\nrealized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and\ncommissions, intra-day trading\nprofit and loss and changes in\nreserves. Based on a 99%\nconfidence level, Citi would\nexpect two to three days in\nany one year where buy-and-\nhold losses exceed the\nRegulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of\nCiti\u2019s VAR model (as a result\nof taking the greater of\nshort- and long-term\nvolatilities and fat-tail\nscaling of volatilities), Citi\nwould expect fewer exceptions\nunder normal and stable market\nconditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions\ncould increase the number of\nback-testing exceptions. As of\nMarch 31, 2021, there were no\nback-testing exceptions\nobserved for Citi\u2019s Regulatory\nVAR for the prior 12 months.\n                               73                               \n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \nFor additional information\nregarding strategic risk,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of\nstrategic risk, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Strategic Risk\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n                                                                \n  LIBOR Transition Risk                                         \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto transition away from LIBOR,\nincluding implementing its\nLIBOR transition action plans\nand associated roadmaps under\nits key workstreams, as well\nas working with clients,\nregulators and various\nindustry groups such as the\nAlternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (ARRC).

The\nlegislation addresses the\ntransition away from USD LIBOR\nfor legacy contracts that are\ngoverned by New York law and\nthat lack fallback provisions\nor contain fallback provisions\nthat are based in any way on\nUSD LIBOR. Upon USD LIBOR\u2019s\npermanent discontinuance, USD\nLIBOR in such contracts will\nbe replaced with a rate based\non SOFR plus a spread\nadjustment by operation of\nlaw.\n\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s actions to\naddress a transition away from\nand discontinuance of LIBOR,\nsee \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Strategic Risk\u2014LIBOR\nTransition Risk\u201d in Citi\u2019s\n2020 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.

For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries,\n\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers. As an\nexample, with respect to the\nU.K., only 35% of corporate\nloans presented in the table\nbelow are to U.K. domiciled\nentities (38% for unfunded\ncommitments), with the balance\nof the loans predominately to\nEuropean domiciled\ncounterparties. Approximately\n82% of the total U.K. funded\nloans and 84% of the total\nU.K. unfunded commitments were\ninvestment grade as of March\n31, 2021.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

As\nof March 31, 2021, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.1 billion. Citi uses the\nU.S. dollar as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\nArgentina because the\nArgentine economy is\nconsidered highly inflationary\nunder U.S. GAAP.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\ngovernment of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat restrict Citi\u2019s ability\nto access U.S. dollars in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nCiti\u2019s net investment in its\nArgentine operations is likely\nto increase as Citi generates\nnet income in its Argentine\nfranchise and its earnings are\nunable to be remitted.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of March 31,\n2021, the international NDF\nmarket had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\u2019s\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge nearly all of its\nArgentine peso exposure. As a\nresult, and to the extent that\nCiti does not execute NDF\ncontracts for this unhedged\nexposure in the future, Citi\nwould record devaluations on\nits net Argentine\npeso\u2010denominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate\nallowances for credit losses\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\nsuch risks under U.S. GAAP as\nof March 31, 2021. However,\nU.S. regulatory agencies may\nrequire Citi to record\nadditional reserves in the\nfuture, increasing ICG \u2019s cost\nof credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\ncontains a summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCitigroup\u2019s 2020 Annual Report\non Form 10-K). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. These judgments have\nthe potential to impact the\nCompany\u2019s\n\nfinancial performance for\ninstruments where the changes\nin fair value are recognized\nin either the Consolidated\nStatement of Income or in AOCI\n.\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nare recognized in earnings.\nWhere Citi does not intend to\nsell the security nor could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nthe portion of the loss\nrelated to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAdjudicating the temporary\nnature of fair value\nimpairments is also inherently\njudgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in this Form 10-Q\nand Note 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2020 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                               77                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below shows Citi\u2019s\nACL during the first quarter\nof 2021.

In\naddition, Citi provides\nallowances for an estimate of\ncurrent expected credit losses\nfor other financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost,\nincluding held-to-maturity\nsecurities, reverse repurchase\nagreements, securities\nborrowed, deposits with banks\nand other financial\nreceivables carried at\namortized cost (these\nallowances, together with the\nACLL, are referred to as the\nACL).\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. For the\nquantitative component, Citi\nuses a forward-looking base\nmacroeconomic forecast that is\ncomplemented by a qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent. As further\ndiscussed below, this\nqualitative component reflects\n(i) economic uncertainty\nrelated to an alternative\ndownside scenario, (ii) loss\nadjustments for concentration\nand collateral, and (iii)\nspecific adjustments based on\nthe associated portfolio for\nestimating the ACL, including\nadjustments that reflect the\ncurrent uncertainty around the\nestimated impact of the\npandemic on credit loss\nestimates.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent based on (i) its\ncomprehensive internal history\nand system of credit risk\nratings, (ii) rating and score\nagency information regarding\ndefault rates and loss data,\nincluding internal data on the\nseverity of losses in the\nevent of default,\n\nand (iii) a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast of future\nmacroeconomic conditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit loss is determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nfor the borrowers\u2019 probability\nof default (PD), loss given\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at\ndefault (EAD). The loss\nlikelihood and severity models\nused for estimating expected\ncredit losses are sensitive to\nchanges in macroeconomic\nvariables that inform the\nforecasts.\n\nFor corporate portfolios, the\nloss likelihood and loss\nseverity models cover a wide\nrange of geographic, industry,\nproduct and business segments\nthat contribute to the\nportfolios.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s\ndelinquency-managed portfolios\ncontaining smaller-balance\nhomogeneous loans also\nprimarily use PD, LGD and EAD\nmodels to determine expected\ncredit losses and reserve\nbalances based on leading\ncredit indicators, including\nloan delinquencies and changes\nin portfolio size, as well as\nother current economic factors\nand credit trends, including\nhousing prices, unemployment\nand gross domestic product\n(GDP). This methodology is\napplied separately for each\nproduct within each geographic\nregion in which these\nportfolios exist, including\nthe U.S., Mexico and Asia.\n\nDefault frequency, risk\nratings, loss recovery rates,\nsize and diversity of\nindividual large credits and\nability of borrowers with\nforeign currency obligations\nto obtain the foreign currency\nnecessary for orderly debt\nservicing, among other things,\nare all taken into account.\nChanges in these estimates\ncould have a direct impact on\nCiti\u2019s credit costs and the\nallowance in any period.\n                               78                               \nQualitative Management\nAdjustment Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component\nconsiders, among other things,\nthe uncertainty of forward-\nlooking economic scenarios\nbased on the likelihood and\nseverity of downside\nscenarios, certain portfolio\ncharacteristics and\nconcentrations, collateral\ncoverage, model limitations,\nidiosyncratic events and other\nrelevant criteria under\nbanking supervisory guidance\nfor the ACL. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment also\nreflects the current\nuncertainty around the\nestimated impact of the\npandemic on credit loss\nestimates. 1Q21 Combined\nQuantitative and Qualitative\nComponents In the first\nquarter of 2021, Citi (i)\nreleased $1.9 billion of the\nACL for its consumer\nportfolios and (ii) released\n$1.9 billion of the ACL for\nits corporate portfolios.\nConsumer and corporate ACLs\nwere impacted by improvements\nin both macroeconomic\nconditions for the\nquantitative base scenario and\nthe qualitative management\nadjustment associated with an\nalternative downside scenario,\nwhich incorporated a lower\nseverity and likelihood. This\nrelease was partially offset\nby an increase in other\nqualitative adjustments\nrelated to ongoing uncertainty\ndue to the pandemic, with\nfocus on the collectability of\nconsumer balances associated\nwith borrowers who may be\nparticipating in non-Citi\nforbearance or rent moratorium\nprograms. The extent of the\npandemic\u2019s ultimate impact on\nCiti\u2019s ACL will depend on,\namong other things, (i) how\nconsumers respond to the\nconclusion of government\nstimulus and assistance\nprograms; (ii) the impact on\nunemployment; (iii) the timing\nand extent of the economic\nrecovery; (iv) the severity\nand duration of any resurgence\nof COVID-19; (v) the rate of\ndistribution and\nadministration of vaccines;\nand (vi) the extent of any\nmarket volatility. Citi\nbelieves its analysis of the\nACL reflects the forward view\nof the economic analysis as of\nMarch 31, 2021, based on its\nlatest available base\nmacroeconomic forecast.\n\nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nuses a multitude of variables\nin its base macroeconomic\nforecast as part of its\ncalculation of both the\nquantitative and qualitative\n(including the downside\nscenario) components of the\nACL, including both domestic\nand international variables\nfor its global portfolios and\nexposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. Real GDP rate represent\nthe key macroeconomic\nvariables that most\nsignificantly affect its\nestimate of its consumer and\ncorporate ACLs.

Consumer\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACL release\n(including Corporate/Other )\nof $1.9 billion in the first\nquarter of 2021 reduced the\nACL balance to $17.6 billion,\nor 6.41% of total consumer\nloans at March 31, 2021. The\nrelease was primarily driven\nby the improved macroeconomic\nforecast for the first\nquarter, as well as a decrease\nin loan volumes. Citi\u2019s\nconsumer ACL is largely driven\nby the cards businesses. For\ncards, including Citi\u2019s\ninternational businesses, the\nlevel of reserves relative to\nEOP loans decreased to 10.72%\nat March 31, 2021, compared to\n10.98% at December 31, 2020,\nprimarily due to the improved\nbase macroeconomic forecast\n                               79                               \nfor the first quarter of 2021.\nFor the remaining consumer\nexposures, the level of\nreserves relative to EOP loans\ndecreased slightly to 1.8% at\nMarch 31, 2021, compared to\n2.0% at December 31, 2020.\n\nCorporate\n\nCiti\u2019s corporate ACLL release\nof $1.3 billion in the first\nquarter of 2021 reduced the\nACLL reserve balance to $4.1\nbillion, or 1.06% of total\nfunded loans, and was\nprimarily driven by the\nimproved macroeconomic\nforecast scenario for the\nfirst quarter, as well as\nmodest improvements in\nportfolio credit quality.\n\nThe ACLUC release of $0.6\nbillion in the first quarter\nof 2021 decreased the total\ncorporate ACLUC reserve\nbalance included in Other\nliabilities to $2.0 billion at\nMarch 31, 2021.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt March 31, 2021, the ratio\nof the allowance for credit\nlosses to total funded loans\nwas 3.29% (6.41% for consumer\nloans and 1.06% for corporate\nloans), compared to 3.73% at\nDecember 31, 2020 (6.77% for\nconsumer loans and 1.42% for\ncorporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $5.1 billion at March 31,\n2021, down $578 million from\nDecember 31, 2020. Consumer\nnon-accrual loans decreased\n$157 million to $2.0 billion\nat March 31, 2021 from $2.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020,\nwhile corporate non-accrual\nloans decreased $421 million\nto $3.1 billion at March 31,\n2021 from $3.5 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020. In\naddition, the ratio of non-\naccrual loans to total\ncorporate loans was 0.79%, and\n0.72% of non-accrual loans to\ntotal consumer loans, at March\n31, 2021.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has elected to phase in\nthe CECL impact for regulatory\ncapital purposes. The\ntransition provisions were\nrecently modified to defer the\nphase-in. After two years with\nno impact on capital, the CECL\ntransition impact will phase\nin over a three-year\ntransition period with 25% of\nthe impact (net of deferred\ntaxes) recognized on the first\nday of each subsequent year,\ncommencing January 1, 2022,\nand will be fully implemented\non January 1, 2025. In\naddition, 25% of the build\n(pretax) made in 2020 and 2021\nwill be deferred and amortized\nover the same timeframe.\n\nFor a further description of\nthe ACL and related accounts,\nsee Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor a discussion of the\nadoption of the CECL\naccounting pronouncement, see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually as of July\n1 (the annual test) and\nthrough interim assessments\nbetween annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances\nchange that could more-likely-\nthan-not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its\ncarrying amount, such as a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsignificant decline in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nCiti performed the annual test\nas of July 1, 2020. The fair\nvalues of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units as a\npercentage of their carrying\nvalues ranged from\napproximately 115% to 136%,\nresulting in no impairment.\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, the current\nenvironment continues to\nevolve due to the COVID-19\npandemic. Deterioration in\nbusiness performance or\nmacroeconomic and market\nconditions, including\npotential adverse effects to\neconomic forecasts due to the\nseverity and duration of the\npandemic, as well as the\nresponses of governments,\ncustomers and clients, could\nnegatively influence the\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, in particular, the\ndiscount and growth rates used\nin the net income projections.\nIf the future were to differ\nfrom management\u2019s best\nestimate of key economic\nassumptions and associated\ncash flows were to decrease,\nCiti could potentially\nexperience material goodwill\nimpairment charges in the\nfuture.

Net DTAs\narising from temporary differences are deducted from regulatory\ncapital if in excess of the 10%/15% limitations (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u201d above). For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, Citi\ndid not have any such DTAs. Accordingly, the remaining $14.4\nbillion of net DTAs as of March 31, 2021 was not deducted in\ncalculating regulatory capital pursuant to Basel III standards\nand was appropriately risk weighted under those rules.\n\nDTA Realizability Citi believes that the realization of the\nrecognized net DTAs of $24.2 billion at March 31, 2021 is more-\nlikely-than-not based upon management\u2019s expectations as to\nfuture taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs\narise, as well as consideration of available tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ). In the\nsecond quarter of 2021, as part of the normal planning process,\nCiti will update its forecasts of operating income and its\nforeign source income forecast. These updates could affect\nCiti\u2019s valuation allowance against FTC carry-forwards. Effective\nTax Rate Citi\u2019s reported effective tax rate for the first\nquarter of 2021 was approximately 23%. This compares to an\neffective tax rate of approximately 19% in the first quarter of\n2020. The higher rate in the quarter reflected the increase in\npretax earnings.\n                               81                               \n                                                                \n   DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                           \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures.

In\nthe opinion of management, all\nadjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded in Citigroup\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31,\n2020 (2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K). Certain financial\ninformation that is normally\nincluded in annual financial\nstatements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), but is not required\nfor interim reporting\npurposes, has been condensed\nor omitted. Management must\nmake estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the\nrelated footnote disclosures.\nWhile management uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT\nACCOUNTING POLICIES See Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\na summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting\nfor Financial Instruments \u2014\nCredit Losses Overview In June\n2016, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) issued\nASU No. 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments \u2014 Credit Losses\n(Topic 326). The ASU\nintroduced a new credit loss\nmethodology, the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology, which requires\nearlier recognition of credit\nlosses while also providing\nadditional disclosure about\ncredit risk. Citi adopted the\nASU as of January 1, 2020,\nwhich, as discussed below,\nresulted in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s Allowance for credit\nlosses and a decrease to\nopening Retained earnings ,\nnet of deferred income taxes,\nat January 1, 2020. The CECL\nmethodology utilizes a\nlifetime \u201cexpected credit\nloss\u201d measurement objective\nfor the recognition of credit\nlosses for loans, held-to-\nmaturity debt securities,\nreceivables and other\nfinancial assets measured at\namortized cost at the time the\nfinancial asset is originated\nor acquired. The ACL is\nadjusted each period for\nchanges in expected lifetime\ncredit losses. The CECL\nmethodology represents a\nsignificant change from prior\nU.S. GAAP and replaced the\nprior multiple existing\nimpairment methods, which\ngenerally required that a loss\nbe incurred before it was\nrecognized. Within the life\ncycle of a loan or other\nfinancial asset, the\nmethodology generally results\nin the earlier recognition of\nthe provision for credit\nlosses and the related ACL\nthan prior U.S. GAAP. For\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities where fair value is\nless than cost that Citi\nintends to hold or more-\nlikely-than-not will not be\nrequired to sell, credit-\nrelated impairment, if any, is\nrecognized through an ACL and\nadjusted each period for\nchanges in credit risk.\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL\nTransition (Day 1) Impact The\nCECL methodology\u2019s impact on\nexpected credit losses, among\nother things, reflects Citi\u2019s\nview of the current state of\nthe economy, forecasted\nmacroeconomic conditions and\nCiti\u2019s portfolios. At the\nJanuary 1, 2020 date of\nadoption, based on forecasts\nof macroeconomic conditions\nand exposures at that time,\nthe aggregate impact to Citi\nwas an approximate $\n4.1billion, or an approximate\n29%, pretax increase in the\nAllowance for credit losses ,\nalong with a $ 3.1billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained\nearnings and a deferred tax\nasset increase of $\n1.0billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $\n4.9billion build to the\nAllowance for credit losses\nfor Citi\u2019s consumer exposures,\nprimarily driven by the impact\non credit card receivables of\nlonger estimated tenors under\nthe CECL lifetime expected\ncredit loss methodology (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n23months) compared to shorter\nestimated tenors under the\nprobable loss methodology\nunder prior U.S. GAAP (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n14months), net of recoveries;\nand (ii) a release of $\n0.8billion of reserves\nprimarily related to Citi\u2019s\ncorporate net loan loss\nexposures, largely due to more\nprecise contractual maturities\nthat result in shorter\nremaining tenors,\nincorporation of recoveries\nand use\n                               96                               \nof more specific historical loss data based on an increase in\nportfolio segmentation across industries and geographies. Under\nthe CECL methodology, the Allowance for credit losses consists\nof quantitative and qualitative components. Citi\u2019s quantitative\ncomponent of the Allowance for credit losses is model based and\nutilizes a single forward-looking macroeconomic forecast,\ncomplemented by the qualitative component described below, in\nestimating expected credit losses and discounts inputs for the\ncorporate classifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and\nsupportable forecast periods vary by product. For example,\nCiti\u2019s consumer models use a 13-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period and revert to historical loss experience\nthereafter, while its corporate loan models use a nine-quarter\nreasonable and supportable period followed by a three-quarter\ngraduated transition to historical loss experience. Citi\u2019s\nqualitative component of the Allowance for credit losses\nconsiders (i) the uncertainty of forward-looking scenarios based\non the likelihood and severity of a possible recession as\nanother possible scenario; (ii) certain portfolio\ncharacteristics, such as portfolio concentration and collateral\ncoverage; and (iii) model limitations as well as idiosyncratic\nevents. Citi calculates a judgmental management adjustment,\nwhich is an alternative, more adverse scenario that only\nconsiders downside risk. Accounting for Variable Post-Charge-Off\nThird-Party Collection Costs In the fourth quarter of 2020, Citi\nrevised the 2020 second quarter accounting conclusion for its\nvariable post-charge-off third-party collection costs from a\n\u201cchange in accounting estimate effected by a change in\naccounting principle\u201d to a \u201cchange in accounting principle,\u201d\nwhich required an adjustment to January 1, 2020 opening retained\nearnings, rather than 2020 net income. As a result, Citi\u2019s full-\nyear and quarterly results for 2020 were revised to reflect this\nchange as if it were effective as of January 1, 2020, as\nfollows: \u2022 An increase to beginning retained earnings on January\n1, 2020 of $ 330million and a decrease of $ 443million in the\nallowance for credit losses on loans, as well as a $ 113million\ndecrease in other assets related to income taxes. \u2022 A decrease\nof $ 18million to provisions for credit losses on loans in the\nfirst quarter and increases of $ 339million and $ 122million to\nprovisions for credit losses on loans in the second and third\nquarters, respectively. \u2022 Increases in operating expenses of $\n49million and $ 45million with a corresponding decrease in net\ncredit losses, in the first and second quarters, respectively.\nIn making these revisions, Citi considered the guidance in ASC\nTopic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ; ASC Topic\n270, Interim Reporting ; ASC Topic 250-S99-1, Assessing\nMateriality ; and ASC Topic 250-S99-23, Accounting Changes Not\nRetroactively Applied Due to Immateriality, Considering the\nEffects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying\nMisstatements in Current Year Financial Statements . Citi\nbelieves that the effects of the revisions were not material to\nany previously reported quarterly or annual period. Reference\nRate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects\nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides\noptional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for\n(or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on\nfinancial reporting. Specifically, the guidance permits an\nentity, when certain criteria are met, to consider amendments to\ncontracts made to comply with reference rate reform to meet the\ndefinition of a modification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows\nhedge accounting to be maintained and permits a one-time\ntransfer or sale of qualifying held-to-maturity securities. The\nexpedients and exceptions provided by the amendments are\npermitted to be adopted any time through December 31, 2022 and\ndo not apply to contract modifications made and hedging\nrelationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022,\nexcept for certain optional expedients elected for certain\nhedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022. The ASU\nwas adopted by Citi as of June 30, 2020 with prospective\napplication and did not impact financial results in 2020. In\nJanuary 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate\nReform (Topic 848): Scope , which clarifies that the scope of\nthe initial accounting relief issued by the FASB in March 2020\nincludes derivative instruments that do not reference a rate\nthat is expected to be discontinued but that use an interest\nrate for margining, discounting or contract price alignment that\nis modified as a result of reference rate reform (commonly\nreferred to as the \u201cdiscounting transition\u201d).

partner. These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner-sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other\npartner payments are based on program sales and new account\nacquisitions.\n(2) Includes overdraft fees of $ 24million and $ 31million for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOverdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310.\n(3) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and\nunderwriting loan syndications or related financing activity.\nThis activity is accounted for under ASC 310.\n                              102                               \n(4) Commissions and fees includes $( 1,749) million and $(\n1,802) million not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers , for the three months ended March 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.

In these\ntransactions, the Company\nrecognizes the securities\nreceived at fair value within\nOther assets and the\nobligation to return those\nsecurities as a liability\nwithin Brokerage payables .\n(2) See Note 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to take possession of the underlying\ncollateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due\nunder the agreements and, when necessary, require prompt\ntransfer of additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value, as described in Notes 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The remaining portion is\ncarried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities\nloaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount\ngenerally in excess of the market value of the securities\nloaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities\nborrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or\nposts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection. The following tables present the gross and\nnet resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing\nand lending agreements and the related offsetting amounts\npermitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts\nrelated to financial instruments that are not permitted to be\noffset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting\nto the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal\nopinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has\nbeen obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by\nfinancial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or\nbeen able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of\nthe offsetting right.\n

An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under business policies. The sections\nbelow describe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected\ncredit impairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of March 31, 2021. Mortgage-\nBacked Securities Citi records no allowances for credit losses\non U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities,\nbecause the Company expects to incur no credit losses in the\nevent of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses\nand due to the nature of the counterparties. State and Municipal\nSecurities The process for estimating credit losses in\nCitigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily based on\na credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit ratings.\nCiti monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing\ndefault protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance.\nThe average external credit rating, ignoring any insurance, is\nAa2/AA. In the event of an external rating downgrade or other\nindicator of credit impairment (i.e., based on instrument-\nspecific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer\ndefault), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse\nchanges in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell, or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is\nrecognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where\nCiti has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an\nallowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects\nnot to collect, capped at the difference between the bond\u2019s\namortized cost basis and fair value. Equity Method Investments\nManagement assesses equity method investments that have fair\nvalues that are less than their respective carrying values for\nother-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured\nas price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly\nlisted securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other\nmethods are used (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). For impaired equity method investments that Citi\nplans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair\nvalue will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether\nthe impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the cause of the impairment and the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,\nincluding any specific events that may influence the operations\nof the issuer; \u2022 the intent and ability to hold the investment\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in market value; and \u2022 the length of time and extent to\nwhich fair value has been less than the carrying value.\n                              120

Fair\nValue Non-marketable equity\nsecurities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.\nImpairment indicators that are\nconsidered include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n\u2022 a significant deterioration\nin the earnings performance,\ncredit rating, asset quality\nor business prospects of the\ninvestee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the\nregulatory, economic or\ntechnological environment of\nthe investee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the general\nmarket condition of either the\ngeographical area or the\nindustry in which the investee\noperates; \u2022 a bona fide offer\nto purchase, an offer by the\ninvestee to sell or a\ncompleted auction process for\nthe same or similar investment\nfor an amount less than the\ncarrying amount of that\ninvestment; and \u2022 factors that\nraise significant concerns\nabout the investee\u2019s ability\nto continue as a going\nconcern, such as negative cash\nflows from operations, working\ncapital deficiencies or\nnoncompliance with statutory\ncapital requirements or debt\ncovenants. When the\nqualitative assessment\nindicates that impairment\nexists, the investment is\nwritten down to fair value,\nwith the full difference\nbetween the fair value of the\ninvestment and its carrying\namount recognized in earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                    March 31, 2021               2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value          $           1,079    $           962  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative:\n                                                                \n  In millions of dollars         Three Months Ended             \n  Measurement                             March 31,             \n  alternative(1):                              2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impairment losses           $                   \u2014    $     3  \n  Downward changes for                            \u2014          \u2014  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                             81         25  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on these nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                        March 31, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                           68  \n  Downward changes for                                      53  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       567  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

Investments in\nAlternative Investment Funds\nThat Calculate Net Asset Value\nThe Company holds investments\nin certain alternative\ninvestment funds that\ncalculate net asset value\n(NAV), or its equivalent,\nincluding private equity\nfunds, funds of funds and real\nestate funds, as provided by\nthird-party asset managers.\nInvestments in such funds are\ngenerally classified as non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at fair value. The\nfair values of these\ninvestments are estimated\nusing the NAV of the Company\u2019s\nownership interest in the\nfunds. Some of these\ninvestments are in \u201ccovered\nfunds\u201d for purposes of the\nVolcker Rule, which prohibits\ncertain proprietary investment\nactivities and limits the\nownership of, and\nrelationships with, covered\nfunds.

past due are generally\nclassified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past\ndue when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90\ndays or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest and/or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(4) Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not\nincluded in the various delinquency columns.\n                              133

Default is defined as 60days past due, except for\nclassifiably managed commercial banking loans, where default is\ndefined as 90days past due.\n                                                                \n                            TDR                        TDR      \n                            loans                      loans    \n                            that                       that     \n                  TDR       re-def\u2026          TDR       re-def\u2026  \n               balan\u2026       in 2021       balan\u2026       in 2020  \n  In\u00a0              at       within            at       within   \n  milli\u2026        March       one            March       one      \n  of\u00a0             31,       year of          31,       year of  \n  dolla\u2026         2021       modifi\u2026         2020       modifi\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comme\u2026                                                        \n  and       $     283    $  \u2014          $     685    $  \u2014        \n  indus\u2026                                                        \n  Mortg\u2026                                                        \n  and              83       \u2014                 77       \u2014        \n  real                                                          \n  estate                                                        \n  Other            35       \u2014                 15       \u2014        \n  Total\u2026    $     401    $  \u2014          $     777    $  \u2014        \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding that\nwere considered TDRs as of the end of the reporting period.\n                              137                               \n                                                                \n  14.

The results of the 2020 annual\nimpairment test resulted in fair values as a percentage of\ncarrying values between 115% and 136%. During the three months\nended March 31, 2021, Citi qualitatively assessed the current\nenvironment, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, management\u2019s announced strategy to pursue exits of its\nconsumer franchises in 13 markets within Asia GCB , observed\nchanges in market multiples, actual business performance,\ntogether with the latest available management forecasts. Based\non the above, Citi determined it was not more-likely-than-not\nthat the fair value of any reporting unit was below its book\nvalue and there was no indication of impairment as of March 31,\n2021. While the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded\nin the key assumptions used in the valuations, the current\nenvironment continues to evolve. Deterioration in business\nperformance or macroeconomic and market conditions, including\npotential adverse effects to economic forecasts due to the\nseverity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the responses\nof governments, customers and clients, could negatively\ninfluence the assumptions used in the valuations, in particular,\nthe discount rates, exit multiples and growth rates used in net\nincome projections. If the future were to differ from\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of key economic assumptions, and\nassociated cash flows were to decrease, Citi could potentially\nexperience material goodwill impairment charges in the future.\nFor additional information regarding Citi\u2019s goodwill impairment\ntesting process, see Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s

Citigroup\u2019s March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the\nCompany has any variable interest or continuing involvement\nconsidered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 78billion and $\n78billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 407million and $\n425million in maximum exposure to loss as of March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.\n                              148                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $\n59.3billion and $ 57.0billion, respectively (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K); \u2022\ncertain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company\nholds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on\narm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities held by the Company, which are classified as\nTrading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has\nno other involvement with the related securitization entity\ndeemed to be significant (for more information on these\npositions, see Notes 12 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements); \u2022 certain representations and warranties exposures\nin legacy ICG -sponsored mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecuritizations in which the Company has no variable interest or\ncontinuing involvement as servicer. The outstanding balance of\nmortgage loans securitized during 2005 to 2008 in which the\nCompany has no variable interest or continuing involvement as\nservicer was approximately $ 5.1billion and $ 5.22billion at\nMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively; \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have\na variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the legal form of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the Company\u2019s standard accounting policies for the\nasset type and line of business. The asset balances for\nunconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant\ninvolvement represent the most current information available to\nthe Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an\namortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair\nvalue information is readily available to the Company. The\nmaximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying\namount of the Company\u2019s investment in the VIE. It reflects the\ninitial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any\naccrued interest and cash principal payments received. The\ncarrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines\nin fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings.\nThe maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the\nremaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and\ncredit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount\nof a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest.\nIn certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative\ninstruments or other arrangements that are not considered\nvariable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-\ncurrency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit\nprotection under a credit default swap or total return swap\nwhere the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the\nSPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in\nthe maximum exposure amounts.\n                              149                               \nFunding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated\nVIEs\u2014Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments\nThe following table presents the notional amount of liquidity\nfacilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding\ncommitments in the VIE tables above:\n                                                                \n                 March                    Decemb\u2026               \n                   31,                        31,               \n                  2021                       2020               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  milli\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026       Liquid\u2026       Loan/\u2026  \n  of           facili\u2026       commi\u2026       facili\u2026       commi\u2026  \n  dolla\u2026                                                        \n  Non-a\u2026                                                        \n  mortg\u2026    $        \u2014    $       5    $        \u2014    $       2  \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  Asset\u2026             \u2014       10,626             \u2014        9,114  \n  finan\u2026                                                        \n  Munic\u2026                                                        \n  secur\u2026                                                        \n  tender                                                        \n  option         1,557            \u2014         1,611            \u2014  \n  bond                                                          \n  trusts                                                        \n  (TOBs)                                                        \n  Munic\u2026             \u2014        3,063             \u2014        3,041  \n  inves\u2026                                                        \n  Inves\u2026             \u2014           14             \u2014           15  \n  funds                                                         \n  Other              \u2014           50             \u2014            \u2014  \n  Total                                                         \n  fundi\u2026    $    1,557    $  13,758    $    1,611    $  12,172  \n  commi\u2026                                                        \n                                                                \nSignificant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs\u2014Balance Sheet\nClassification\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and\nclassification of significant variable interests in\nunconsolidated VIEs:\n                                                                \n  In billions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                March 31, 2021                   2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Cash                $               \u2014    $                 \u2014  \n  Trading account                   1.8                    2.0  \n  assets                                                        \n  Investments                      10.2                   10.6  \n  Total loans, net                 31.3                   29.3  \n  of allowance                                                  \n  Other                             0.4                    0.3  \n  Total assets        $            43.7    $              42.2  \n                                                                \nCredit Card Securitizations Substantially all of the Company\u2019s\ncredit card securitization activity is through\ntwotrusts\u2014Citibank Credit Card Master Trust (Master Trust) and\nCitibank Omni Master Trust (Omni Trust), with the substantial\nmajority through the Master Trust.

Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021 and 2020. These\nsecurities are backed by\neither residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of\nclients. As of March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, Citi\nheld noretained interests in\nprivate label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi.\n\nThe Company also re-\nsecuritizes U.S. government-\nagency guaranteed mortgage-\nbacked (agency) securities.\nDuring the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2021, Citi\ntransferred agency securities\nwith a fair value of\napproximately $ 13.1billion to\nre-securitization entities\ncompared to approximately $\n7.4billion for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2020.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the fair\nvalue of Citi-retained\ninterests in agency re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi totaled\napproximately $ 1.2billion\n(including $ 335.0million\nrelated to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2021)\ncompared to $ 1.6billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020 (including $\n916.0million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2020), which is\nrecorded in Trading account\nassets . The original fair\nvalues of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020 were\napproximately $ 76.2billion\nand $ 83.6billion,\nrespectively. As of March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020,\nthe Company did not\nconsolidate any private label\nor agency re-securitization\nentities. Citi-Administered\nAsset-Backed Commercial Paper\nConduits At March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the\ncommercial paper conduits\nadministered by Citi had\napproximately $ 16.5billion\nand $ 16.7billion of purchased\nassets outstanding,\nrespectively, and had\nincremental funding\ncommitments with clients of\napproximately $ 19.2billion\nand $ 17.1billion,\nrespectively. Substantially\nall of the funding of the\nconduits is in the form of\nshort-term commercial paper.\nAt March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, the weighted average\nremaining lives of the\ncommercial paper issued by the\nconduits were approximately\n60and 54days, respectively.\nThe primary credit enhancement\nprovided to the conduit\ninvestors is in the form of\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancements described above.\nIn addition to the\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancements, the conduits,\nother than the government-\nguaranteed loan conduit, have\nobtained letters of credit\nfrom the Company, which equal\nat least 8% to 10% of the\nconduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The\nletters of credit provided by\nthe Company to the conduits\ntotal approximately $\n1.5billion and $ 1.5billion as\nof March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively. The\nnet result across multi-seller\nconduits administered by the\nCompany is that, in the event\nthat defaulted assets exceed\nthe transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements described\nabove, any losses in each\nconduit are allocated first to\nthe Company and then to the\ncommercial paper investors. At\nMarch 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, the Company owned $\n6.5billion and $ 6.6billion,\nrespectively, of the\ncommercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits.

For the\nremaining exposure related to TOB transactions, where the\nresidual owned by the customer was at least 25% of the bond\nvalue at the inception of the transaction, no reimbursement\nagreement was executed. The Company also provides other\nliquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored\nmunicipal investment funds, which are not variable interest\nentities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $\n3billion and $ 3.6billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nInformation pertaining to\nCitigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from market\nfluctuations (i.e., market\nrisk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or\nperiods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e.,\nliquidity risk), as well as\nany market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n                              157

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              158                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of March\n31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against\ngross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to\nenforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. As a\nresult, the tables reflect a\nreduction of approximately $\n250billion and $ 280billion as\nof March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively, of\nderivative assets and\nderivative liabilities that\npreviously would have been\nreported on a gross basis, but\nare now legally settled and\nnot subject to collateral. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              159

The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nCitigroup considers the\npremium associated with\nforward contracts (i.e., the\ndifferential between the spot\nand contractual forward rates)\nas the cost of hedging; this\namount is excluded from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally\nreflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge.\nCiti also excludes changes in\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the value\nof the hedged inventory is\nreflected in earnings, which\noffsets the change in the fair\nvalue of the futures contract\nthat is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedging instrument recorded in\nearnings includes changes in\nforward rates, Citigroup\nexcludes the differential\nbetween the spot and the\ncontractual forward rates\nunder the futures contract\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, and it is\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in forward rates from\nthe assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income.\n                              162

These cash flow hedging relationships\nuse either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis\nto assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective\nat inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of March 31, 2021 is\napproximately $ 1.1billion. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted cash flows are hedged is 10years. The pretax\nchange in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below.

settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at both\nMarch 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020 was $ 22billion and $\n25billion, respectively. The\nCompany posted $ 19billion and\n$ 22billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of March\n31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger\nadditional collateral or cash\nsettlement requirements for\nthe Company and certain\naffiliates. In the event that\nCitigroup and Citibank were\ndowngraded a single notch by\nall threemajor rating agencies\nas of March 31, 2021, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $ 1billion\nas either collateral or\nsettlement of the derivative\ntransactions. In addition, the\nCompany could be required to\nsegregate with third-party\ncustodians collateral\npreviously received from\nexisting derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 1billion upon the single\nnotch downgrade, resulting in\naggregate cash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $ 2billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nboth the asset amounts\nderecognized and the gross\ncash proceeds received as of\nthe date of derecognition were\n$ 1.9billion and $ 2.0billion\nas of March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nrespectively. At March 31,\n2021, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 2.1billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of March 31, 2021 was\n$ 252million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n22million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2020, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.2billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 135million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n7million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              167                               \n20.

These two types of\ninputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level\n1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active and model-derived valuations in\nwhich all significant inputs and significant value drivers are\nobservable in active markets. \u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable . As required under\nthe fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and\nobservable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The\nfrequency of transactions, the size of the bid/ask spread and\nthe amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar\ntransactions are all factors in determining the relevance of\nobserved prices in those markets.\n                              168                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nThe Company may hedge positions that have been classified in the\nLevel 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging\ninstruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with\nfinancial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.

In other\ninstances, market changes have\nresulted in unobservable\nvolatility becoming an\ninsignificant input to the\noverall valuation of the\ninstrument (e.g., when an\noption becomes deep-in or\ndeep-out of the money). This\nhas primarily resulted in $\n2.7billion of certain\nstructured long-term debt\nproducts being transferred\nfrom Level 3 to Level 2.\n                              176                               \nValuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements The following tables present the valuation\ntechniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the\nmost significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements.

See Notes 17 and 20\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n                              183                               \nOwn Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA) Own debt valuation\nadjustments are recognized on Citi\u2019s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected using Citi\u2019s credit spreads\nobserved in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . Among other\nvariables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and\nsimilar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of\nthe Company\u2019s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair\nvalue of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in\nthe Company\u2019s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit\nrisk) were a loss of $ 38million and a gain of $ 4,188million\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in\ninstrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating\nthe Company\u2019s current credit spreads observable in the bond\nmarket into the relevant valuation technique used to value each\nliability as described above. The Fair Value Option for\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities Selected Portfolios\nof Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities\nBorrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase,\nSecurities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term\nBorrowings The Company elected the fair value option for certain\nportfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements\nto resell and fixed income securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain\nuncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-\ndealer entities in the United States, the United Kingdom and\nJapan. In each case, the election was made because the related\ninterest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily\nwith offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at\nfair value through earnings. Changes in fair value for\ntransactions in these portfolios are recorded in Principal\ntransactions . The related interest revenue and interest expense\nare measured based on the contractual rates specified in the\ntransactions and are reported as Interest revenue and Interest\nexpense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans\nand Other Credit Products Citigroup has also elected the fair\nvalue option for certain other originated and purchased loans,\nincluding certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and\nletters of credit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading\nbusinesses. None of these credit products are highly leveraged\nfinancing commitments. Significant groups of transactions\ninclude loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be\neither sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions\nwhere the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments,\nsuch as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps\nwhere the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans\nto a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to\nmitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting\nis complex and to achieve operational simplifications.

Changes\nin the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are\nclassified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended March 31, 2021\nand 2020 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a\nloss of $( 2) million and a loss of $( 83) million,\nrespectively. Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals\nCitigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold,\nsilver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity and\nforeign currency trading activities or to economically hedge\ncertain exposures from issuing structured liabilities. Under ASC\n815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and\na commodity forward derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the\nfair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the\ndebt host contract within Trading account assets on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount\nof debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals\naccounts was approximately $ 0.7billion and $ 0.5billion at\nMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The amounts\nare expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in future\nperiods. As part of its commodity and foreign currency trading\nactivities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments\nand executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative\ncontracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an\nunallocated precious metals investment, Citi\u2019s receivable from\nits depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its\ninvestment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward\npurchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed\nto unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative,\nat fair value through earnings. As of March 31, 2021, there were\napproximately $ 6.0billion and $ 5.0billion of notional amounts\nof such forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts\noutstanding, respectively. Certain Investments in Private Equity\nand Real Estate Ventures Citigroup invests in private equity and\nreal estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment\nreturns and for capital appreciation. The Company has elected\nthe fair value option for certain of these ventures, because\nsuch investments are considered similar to many private equity\nor hedge fund activities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which\nare reported at fair value. The fair value option brings\nconsistency in the accounting and evaluation of these\ninvestments. All investments (debt and equity) in such private\nequity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value.\nThese investments are classified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair values of these\ninvestments are classified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-\nfor-Sale (HFS) Citigroup has elected the fair value option for\ncertain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming\nadjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are\nintended for sale or securitization and are hedged with\nderivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value\noption to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge\naccounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.\nThe following table provides information about certain mortgage\nloans HFS carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of             March 31,                          \n  dollars                         2021       December 31, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the         $      1,434    $              1,742  \n  Consolidated Balance                                          \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggregate fair value                                          \n  in excess of (less              -276                      91  \n  than) unpaid                                                  \n  principal balance                                             \n  Balance of                                                    \n  non-accrual loans or                                          \n  loans                              \u2014                       \u2014  \n  more than 90 days                                             \n  past due                                                      \n  Aggregate unpaid                                              \n  principal balance in                                          \n  excess of fair value                                          \n  for non-accrual                    \u2014                       \u2014  \n  loans or loans more                                           \n  than 90 days past                                             \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              185                               \nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are\nreported in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

Certain Structured Liabilities The Company has\nelected the fair value option for certain structured liabilities\nwhose performance is linked to structured interest rates,\ninflation, currency, equity, referenced credit or commodity\nrisks.

Certain Non-Structured Liabilities The\nCompany has elected the fair value option for certain non-\nstructured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates.\nThe Company has elected the fair value option where the interest\nrate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with\nderivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase\nfinancial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings. The elections have been made to mitigate\naccounting mismatches and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.

For certain\ncontracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties.

lending indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be $ 96billion and $\n102billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants.\n                              187                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 32million and $ 31million at March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and these amounts\nare included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Credit Card Arrangements with Partners Citi, in one of\nits credit card partner arrangements, provides guarantees to the\npartner regarding the volume of certain customer originations\nduring the term of the agreement. To the extent that such\norigination targets are not met, the guarantees serve to\ncompensate the partner for certain payments that otherwise would\nhave been generated in connection with such originations. Other\nGuarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card Protection Programs\nCiti, through its credit card businesses, provides various\ncardholder protection programs on several of its card products,\nincluding programs that provide insurance coverage for rental\ncars, coverage for certain losses associated with purchased\nproducts, price protection for certain purchases and protection\nfor lost luggage. These guarantees are not included in the\ntable, since the total outstanding amount of the guarantees and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified. The\nprotection is limited to certain types of purchases and losses,\nand it is not possible to quantify the purchases that would\nqualify for these benefits at any given time. Citi assesses the\nprobability and amount of its potential liability related to\nthese programs based on the extent and nature of its historical\nloss experience. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nactual and estimated losses incurred and the carrying value of\nCiti\u2019s obligations related to these programs were immaterial.\nValue-Transfer Networks (Including Exchanges and Clearing\nHouses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or shareholder in, hundreds\nof value-transfer networks (VTNs) (payment, clearing and\nsettlement systems as well as exchanges) around the world. As a\ncondition of membership, many of these VTNs require that members\nstand ready to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by\nthe organization due to another member\u2019s default on its\nobligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be limited to its\nmembership interests in the VTNs, contributions to the VTN\u2019s\nfunds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro rata share.\nThe maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as this would\nrequire an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred;\nhowever, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote given\nhistorical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of March 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification\nIn 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary\nof Citi, entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the\nrisks and rewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE\nLife (now Genworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a\nsubsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE). As part of this\ntransaction, the reinsurance obligations were provided by two\nregulated insurance subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two\ncollateral trusts with securities. Presently, as discussed\nbelow, the trusts are referred to as the Genworth Trusts. As\npart of GE\u2019s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks\nand rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance\nagreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth\nthrough GE\u2019s Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC)\nsubsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition,\nGE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC\nthat is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay\nits reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance\nagreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has\nreinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has\nreinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC\npolicies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations\nnow benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While\nneither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the\ncapital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse\nand Citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital\nmaintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will\ncontinue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance\nobligations to Genworth. In connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of\nTravelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an\nindemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder\nclaims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the\nTravelers LTC policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by\nsubsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail\ninsurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers\nLTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original\nreinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and\nGenworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole\nbeneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are\ndesigned to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal\nto the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the\nTravelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are\nevaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair\nvalue of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount\nequal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the\nliabilities change over time. If both (i) Genworth fails to\nperform under the original Travelers/GE Life reinsurance\nagreement for any reason,\n                              188                               \nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the\ntwoGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020 related to this indemnification. However,\nif both events become reasonably possible (meaning more than\nremote but less than probable), Citi will be required to\nestimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of\nloss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In\naddition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required\nto accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable\naccounting principles. Citi continues to closely monitor its\npotential exposure under this indemnification obligation, given\nGE\u2019s 2018 LTC and other charges and the September 2019 AM Best\ncredit ratings downgrade for the Genworth subsidiaries.\nSeparately, Genworth announced that it had agreed to be\npurchased by China Oceanwide Holdings Co., Ltd, subject to a\nseries of conditions and regulatory approvals. Citi is\nmonitoring these developments. Futures and Over-the-Counter\nDerivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on central\nclearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-\ntraded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts with\nCCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi has\nconcluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes in\nits role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 19 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually\nagreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass through to the\nclient all interest paid by the CCP or depository institutions\non the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not utilize its right\nas a clearing member to transform cash margin into other assets,\n(iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not liable to the client\nfor the performance of the CCP or the depository institution and\n(iv) the client cash balances are legally isolated from Citi\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate. The total amount of cash initial margin\ncollected and remitted in this manner was approximately $\n16.8billion and $ 16.6billion as of March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively. Variation margin due from clients to the\nrespective CCP, or from the CCP to clients, reflects changes in\nthe value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts for each trading\nday. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-\nperformance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post\nvariation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of\nthe client\u2019s derivative contracts). In the event of non-\nperformance by a client, Citi would move to close out the\nclient\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial\nmargin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any\nremaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing\nmember. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities\nmargin posted by the client, which would typically be expected\nto be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the event the\nclient fails to perform. As required by ASC 860-30-25-5,\nsecurities collateral posted by clients is not recognized on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying Value\u2014Guarantees and\nIndemnifications At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\ntotal carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the\nguarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above\namounted to approximately $ 1.7billion and $ 2.2billion,\nrespectively. The carrying value of financial and performance\nguarantees is included in Other liabilities . For loans sold\nwith recourse, the carrying value of the liability is included\nin Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral available to\nCiti to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and\nindemnifications amounted to $ 60.5billion and $ 51.6billion at\nMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Securities\nand other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $\n92.2billion and $ 80.1billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to\nreimburse losses realized under securities lending\nindemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of\nCiti held as collateral amounted to $ 4.9billion and $\n6.6billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to\ncover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications;\nhowever, the value of such property has not been determined.\n                              189                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

For purposes of this\nNote, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory, or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters as to which an\nestimate can be made. At March\n31, 2021, Citigroup estimates\nthat the reasonably possible\nunaccrued loss for these\nmatters ranges up to\napproximately $ 1.4billion in\nthe aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is\nable to estimate will change,\nand the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition,\nwhile many estimates presented\nin financial statements and\nother financial disclosures\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of\nreasonably possible loss\narising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nhave only preliminary,\nincomplete, or inaccurate\ninformation about the facts\nunderlying the claim; its\nassumptions about the future\nrulings of the court or other\ntribunal on significant\nissues, or the behavior and\nincentives of adverse parties,\nregulators, or tax authorities\nmay prove to be wrong; and the\noutcomes it is attempting to\npredict are often not amenable\nto the use of statistical or\nother quantitative analytical\ntools. In addition, from time\nto time an outcome may occur\nthat Citigroup had not\naccounted for in its estimates\nbecause it had deemed such an\noutcome to be remote. For all\nthese reasons, the amount of\nloss in excess of accruals\nultimately incurred for the\nmatters as to which an\nestimate has been made could\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the range of loss\nincluded in the estimate.\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current legal\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters\ndescribed in this Note would\nnot be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse\n\noutcome in certain of these\nmatters could, from time to\ntime, have a material adverse\neffect on Citigroup\u2019s\nconsolidated results of\noperations or cash flows in\nparticular quarterly or annual\nperiods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nANZ Underwriting Matter In\nMarch 2021, the investigation\nof Citigroup Global Markets\nAustralia Pty Limited\ncommenced by the Australia\nSecurities and Investments\nCommission in 2016 concluded\nwith no enforcement action.\nForeign Exchange Matters\nAntitrust and Other Litigation\n: In 2020, a London-based\ninvestment manager issued a\nclaim against Citibank and\nCitigroup Global Markets\nLimited (CGML), captioned THE\nECU GROUP PLC v.
