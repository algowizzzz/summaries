Year-to-date,\nCiti returned nearly $11\nbillion of capital to its\ncommon shareholders.\n\n\u2022 Citi submitted its plans to\naddress the consent orders\nissued to Citigroup and\nCitibank by the Federal\nReserve Board and Office of\nthe Comptroller of the\nCurrency, respectively (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cCiti\u2019s Consent Order\nCompliance\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K).\n\n\u2022 On November 8, 2021, Citi\nfiled an amended Current\nReport on Form 8-K/A with the\nSEC disclosing that, in\nconnection with the previously\ndisclosed wind-down plan of\nits Korea consumer banking\nbusiness, Citi expects to\nincur total estimated cash\ncharges ranging from\napproximately $1.2 billion to\n$1.5 billion, related to\nvoluntary termination benefits\nand related costs. Citi does\nnot expect to recognize these\ncharges all at once, but over\ntime through the remainder of\n2021 and 2022, as voluntary\nretirements are phased and\nirrevocably accepted in order\nto minimize business and\noperational impacts.\n\nFor a discussion of trends,\nuncertainties and risks that\nwill or could impact Citi\u2019s\nbusinesses, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition during the remainder\nof 2021, see each respective\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations and \u201cForward-\n\nLooking Statements\u201d below, and\n\u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic Overview,\u201d\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Third Quarter of 2021 Results Summary                         \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $4.6 billion, or $2.15 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $3.1 billion, or $1.36 per\nshare, in the prior-year\nperiod. The increase in net\nincome was driven by lower\ncost of credit, partially\noffset by higher expenses and\nlower revenues. Citigroup\u2019s\neffective tax rate was 20% in\nthe current quarter, largely\nunchanged from the third\nquarter of 2020. Earnings per\nshare increased 58%,\nreflecting the increase in net\nincome, as well as a slight\ndecline in average diluted\nshares outstanding.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $17.2\nbillion in the third quarter\nof 2021 decreased 1% from the\nprior-year period. Excluding\nthe Australia loss on sale,\nCitigroup revenues increased\n3%, as higher revenues in ICG\n, along with growth in\nCorporate/Other , were\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in GCB .\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nAustralia loss on sale\nprimarily reflects the impact\nof a currency translation\nadjustment (CTA) loss (net of\nhedges) already reflected in\nthe Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income ( AOCI )\ncomponent of equity. Upon\nclosing, the CTA-related\nbalance would be removed from\nthe AOCI component of equity,\nresulting in a neutral impact\nfrom CTA to Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital.\nUltimately, the sale is\nexpected to result in an\nimprovement in Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio\ndue to the reduction in\nassociated risk-weighted\nassets. (As used throughout\nthis Form 10-Q, Citi\u2019s results\nof operations and financial\ncondition excluding the impact\nof the Australia loss on sale\nare non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. Citi believes the\npresentation of its results of\noperations and financial\ncondition excluding the impact\nof the Australia sale provides\na meaningful depiction of the\nunderlying fundamentals of its\nbroader results and Asia GCB\nbusiness\u2019s results for\ninvestors, industry analysts\nand others.)\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $665 billion,\nlargely unchanged from the\nprior-year period. Excluding\nthe impact of foreign currency\ntranslation into U.S. dollars\nfor reporting purposes (FX\ntranslation), Citigroup\u2019s end-\nof-period loans decreased 1%.\nOn this basis and excluding\nthe impact of held-for-sale\naccounting as a result of the\nAustralia sale (totaling\napproximately $9 billion of\nloans), loans increased 1%,\ndriven by active client\nengagement in treasury and\ntrade solutions, the private\nbank and markets, partially\noffset by lower loans in GCB\nand Corporate/Other .\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits increased 7% to $1.3\ntrillion. Excluding the impact\nof FX translation, Citigroup\u2019s\nend-of-period deposits\nincreased 6%, primarily driven\nby growth across both ICG and\nGCB . (As used throughout this\nForm 10-Q, Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition excluding the impact\nof FX translation are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.)\n                               3                                \n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup operating expenses\nof $11.5 billion increased 5%\nfrom the prior-year period.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, expenses\nincreased 4%, reflecting\ncontinued investments in\nCiti\u2019s transformation, as well\nas business-led investments\nand revenue-related expenses,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a benefit of\n$0.2 billion, compared to a\ncost of $2.4 billion in the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by a net ACL reserve\nrelease of $1.2 billion\n(versus a build of $436\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod) as well as lower net\ncredit losses. Citi\u2019s net ACL\nrelease primarily reflected a\ncontinued improvement in\nportfolio credit quality. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s ACL, see \u201cSignificant\nAccounting Policies and\nSignificant Estimates\u2014Citi\u2019s\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n(ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $1.0\nbillion decreased 50% from the\nprior-year period. Consumer\nnet credit losses of $0.9\nbillion decreased 42%,\nprimarily reflecting lower\nloan volumes and improved\ndelinquencies in the North\nAmerica cards portfolios.\nCorporate net credit losses\ndecreased 88% to $39 million\nfrom $325 million in the\nprior-year period, driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality.\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s Common Equity Tier\n1 (CET1) Capital ratio was\n11.7% as of September 30,\n2021, based on the Basel III\nStandardized Approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets, unchanged from the\nprior-year period, based on\nthe Basel III Advanced\nApproaches framework for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of September\n30, 2021 was 5.8%, compared to\n6.8% as of September 30, 2020.\nThe decrease was primarily\ndriven by the expiration of\ntemporary relief granted by\nthe Federal Reserve Board.

GCB operating\nexpenses of $4.6 billion\nincreased 7% from the prior-\nyear period. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nexpenses increased 5%,\nreflecting continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, as well as\nbusiness-led investments and\nvolume-related expenses,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nGCB revenues of $6.3 billion\ndecreased 13%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation and\nthe Australia loss on sale,\nrevenues decreased 5%, as\ncontinued solid deposit growth\nand momentum in investment\nmanagement were more than\noffset by lower card loans and\nlower deposit spreads.\n\nNorth America GCB revenues of\n$4.3 billion decreased 4%,\nwith lower revenues across\nCiti-branded cards, Citi\nretail services and retail\nbanking. Citi-branded cards\nrevenues of $2.0 billion\ndecreased 1%, reflecting\ncontinued higher payment\nrates. Citi retail services\nrevenues of $1.3 billion\ndecreased 6%, reflecting lower\naverage loans and continued\nhigher payment rates. Retail\nbanking revenues of $1.0\nbillion decreased 7%, as the\nbenefit of stronger deposit\ngrowth was more than offset by\nlower deposit spreads, as well\nas lower mortgage revenues.\n\nYear-over-year, North America\nGCB average deposits of $208\nbillion increased 14%, assets\nunder management of $85\nbillion increased 16% and\naverage retail banking loans\nof $50 billion decreased 7%.\nAverage Citi-branded card\nloans of $82 billion increased\n1%, while average Citi retail\nservices loans of $42 billion\ndecreased 5%. Citi-branded\ncard purchase sales of $106\nbillion increased 24% and Citi\nretail services purchase sales\nof $23 billion increased 14%,\nreflecting a continued\nrecovery in sales activity\nfrom the pandemic-related low\nlevels in the prior-year\nperiod.

Excluding\nthe impact of FX translation\nand the Australia loss on\nsale, international GCB\nrevenues declined 5%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, Latin America GCB\nrevenues declined 7%, driven\nby lower lending volumes and\ndeposit spreads, partially\noffset by growth in assets\nunder management. Excluding\nthe impact of FX translation\nand the Australia loss on\nsale, Asia GCB revenues\ndecreased 4%, reflecting lower\nloans and lower deposit\nspreads, partially offset by\nhigher investment revenues.\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nLatin America GCB and Asia GCB\nfor the third quarter of 2021,\nincluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, see \u201c Global\nConsumer Banking \u2014 Latin\nAmerica GCB \u201d and \u201c Global\nConsumer Banking \u2014 Asia GCB \u201d\nbelow.

On\nthis basis, international GCB\naverage card loans of $19\nbillion decreased 15%,\nprimarily reflecting the\nimpact of held-for-sale\naccounting as a result of the\nAustralia sale, as well as\nhigher payment rates, while\ncard purchase sales of $24\nbillion increased 8%,\nreflecting a continued\nrecovery in purchase sales\nactivity from the pandemic-\nrelated low levels in the\nprior-year period.\n                               4                                \n                                                                \n  Institutional Clients Group                                   \n                                                                \nICG net income of $3.4 billion\nincreased 21%, as lower cost\nof credit and higher revenues\nmore than offset higher\nexpenses. ICG operating\nexpenses increased 9% to $6.4\nbillion, reflecting continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and higher\nrevenue-related expenses,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nICG revenues of $10.8 billion\nincreased 4%, primarily\nreflecting a 12% increase in\nBanking revenues, partially\noffset by a 4% decrease in\nMarkets and securities\nservices revenues. The\nincrease in Banking revenues\nincluded the impact of $47\nmillion of losses on loan\nhedges related to corporate\nlending and the private bank,\ncompared to losses of $124\nmillion related to corporate\nlending and the private bank\nin the prior-year period.\n\nExcluding the impact of losses\non loan hedges, Banking\nrevenues of $5.8 billion\nincreased 11%, as higher\nrevenues in investment\nbanking, corporate lending and\nthe private bank were\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in treasury and trade\nsolutions. Investment banking\nrevenues of $1.9 billion\nincreased 39%, reflecting\nstrong growth across products.\nAdvisory revenues increased\nsignificantly to $539 million,\nequity underwriting revenues\nincreased 5% to $507 million\nand debt underwriting revenues\nincreased 19% to $877 million.\n(As used throughout this Form\n10-Q, Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition excluding the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.)\n\nTreasury and trade solutions\nrevenues of $2.3 billion\ndeclined 4%, or 5% excluding\nthe impact of FX translation,\nas higher fee revenues,\nincluding a recovery in\ncommercial card revenues, as\nwell as growth in trade were\nmore than offset by the impact\nof lower deposit spreads.\nPrivate bank revenues\nincreased 4% to $1.0 billion.\nExcluding the impact of losses\non loan hedges, private bank\nrevenues also increased 4%,\ndriven by higher fees and\nlending volumes, reflecting\nmomentum with both new and\nexisting clients, partially\noffset by lower deposit\nspreads. Corporate lending\nrevenues of $588 million\nincreased 39%. Excluding the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges, corporate lending\nrevenues of $631 million\nincreased 17%, primarily due\nto lower cost of funds and a\nmodest gain on sale, partially\noffset by lower loan volumes.\n\nMarkets and securities\nservices revenues of $5.0\nbillion decreased 4%. Fixed\nincome markets revenues of\n$3.2 billion decreased 16%,\nreflecting the continued\nnormalization in market\nactivity across rates and\nspread products. Equity\nmarkets revenues of $1.2\nbillion increased 40%, driven\nby growth in derivatives,\nprime finance and cash\nequities, reflecting solid\nclient activity and favorable\nmarket conditions. Securities\nservices revenues of $692\nmillion increased 10%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, securities\nservices revenues increased\n9%, driven by strong growth in\nfee revenues with both new and\nexisting clients, including\ngrowth in assets under custody\nand settlement volumes,\npartially offset by lower\ndeposit spreads.

third\nquarter of 2021, compared to a\nnet loss of $607 million in\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by higher\nrevenues and lower expenses,\npartially offset by a lower\nnet ACL release on Citi\u2019s\nresidual legacy portfolio.\nOperating expenses of $519\nmillion decreased 37%,\nprimarily driven by the\nabsence of a prior-year period\ncivil money penalty, partially\noffset by an increase in\nexpenses related to Citi\u2019s\ntransformation.\n\nCorporate/Other revenues of\n$108 million increased from\n$(224) million in the prior-\nyear period, largely\nreflecting higher net

from a \u201cchange in accounting\nestimate effected by a change in accounting principle\u201d to a\n\u201cchange in accounting principle,\u201d which required an adjustment\nto January 1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020\nnet income. As a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and quarterly results\nfor 2020 were revised to reflect this change as if it were\neffective as of January 1, 2020, as follows: an increase to\nbeginning retained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $330 million\nand a decrease of $443 million in the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans, as well as a $113 million decrease in other\nassets related to income taxes; a decrease of $18 million to\nprovisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and\nincreases of $339 million and $122 million to provisions for\ncredit losses on loans in the second and third quarters,\nrespectively; and increases in operating expenses of $49 million\nand $45 million with a corresponding decrease in net credit\nlosses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. See Note\n1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation.\n\n(2) Certain series of preferred stock have semiannual payment\ndates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n(3) The return on average common stockholders\u2019 equity is\ncalculated using net income less preferred stock dividends\ndivided by average common stockholders\u2019 equity.

Net credit\nlosses decreased 48%,\nconsisting of lower net credit\nlosses in both Citi-branded\ncards (down 45% to $357\nmillion) and Citi retail\nservices (down 53% to $238\nmillion), primarily driven by\nlower loan volumes and\nimproved delinquencies, as a\nresult of the higher payment\nrates.\n\nThe net ACL release was $808\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $5 million in the prior-\nyear period, reflecting\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality and the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook.

and loans at fair value. Gains (losses) on\nloan hedges include the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives\nand the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at\nfair value. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted\nagainst the private bank and corporate lending revenues to\nreflect the cost of credit protection. Gains (losses) on loan\nhedges include $(43) million and $(152) million related to the\ncorporate loan portfolio and $(4) million and $(13) million\nrelated to the private bank for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, respectively. Gains (losses) on loan hedges\ninclude $(117) million and $224 million related to the corporate\nloan portfolio and $(8) million and $37 million related to the\nprivate bank for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2020, respectively. Citigroup\u2019s results of operations excluding\nthe impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.\n\n(2) Excludes principal transactions revenues of ICG businesses\nother than Markets , primarily treasury and trade solutions and\nthe private bank.\n\n(3) Citi assesses its Markets business performance on a total\nrevenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items.\nFor example, securities that generate Net interest revenue may\nbe risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue. For a description of the composition of\nthese revenue line items, see Notes 4, 5 and 6 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n\nThe discussion of the results of operations for ICG below\nexcludes (where noted) the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of\naccrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures.

Markets and\nsecurities services revenues\nwere down 4%, primarily\nreflecting normalization in\nfixed income markets revenues,\npartially offset by growth in\nequity markets and securities\nservices.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nincreased 39%, driven by\nhigher revenues across\nadvisory, equity underwriting\nand debt underwriting.\nAdvisory revenues increased\nsignificantly from the prior-\nyear period, reflecting\nstrength in North America and\nEMEA , driven by growth in the\nmarket wallet as well as\nwallet share gains. Equity\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased modestly, as growth\nin North America and EMEA was\nlargely offset by Asia . Debt\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased 19%, also reflecting\nstrength in North America and\nEMEA , driven by growth in the\nmarket wallet and wallet share\ngains.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 4%.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, revenues declined\n5%, reflecting a decline in\nthe cash business, partially\noffset by an increase in\ntrade. Cash revenues\ndecreased, as strong growth in\nfee revenues reflecting solid\nclient engagement and growth\nin transaction volumes,\nincluding a continued recovery\nin commercial cards from low\npandemic-related levels in the\nprior-year period, were more\nthan offset by the impact of\nlower deposit spreads. The\nincrease in trade revenues was\ndriven by growth in loans\ncompared to a low point in the\nprior-year period, reflecting\nan increase in trade flows and\noriginations, primarily in\nEMEA and Asia . End-of-period\ntrade loans grew 15% (both\nincluding and excluding the\nimpact of FX translation).\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\nincreased 39%, including the\nimpact of losses on loan\nhedges. Excluding the impact\nof losses on loan hedges,\nrevenues increased 17%, driven\nby\n\nlower cost of funds and a\nmodest gain on sale, partially\noffset by lower loan volumes,\nreflecting muted demand given\nstronger client liquidity\npositions.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 4% (both including\nand excluding the impact of\nlosses on loan hedges), mainly\ndue to strong performance in\nNorth America . The increase\nin revenues was driven by\nhigher fees and lending\nvolumes, reflecting continued\nclient engagement, partially\noffset by lower deposit\nspreads and lower capital\nmarkets revenues.\n\nWithin Markets and securities\nservices :\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues decreased 16%,\nreflecting declines across\nNorth America , EMEA and Asia\n, largely driven by a\ncomparison to a strong prior-\nyear period in rates and\nspread products and a\nnormalization in market\nactivity. Non-interest\nrevenues decreased, reflecting\nlower investor client activity\nacross rates and currencies\nand spread products. Net\ninterest revenues also\ndecreased, largely reflecting\na change in the mix of trading\npositions.\n\nRates and currencies revenues\ndecreased 16%, driven by the\nnormalization in market\nactivity, primarily in G10\nrates and a comparison to a\nstrong prior-year period that\nincluded elevated levels of\nvolatility and higher spreads\nrelated to the pandemic.\nSpread products and other\nfixed income revenues\ndecreased 17%, driven by a\ncomparison to a strong prior-\nyear period and a\nnormalization in activity,\nparticularly in flow trading,\nincluding lower volatility and\nspreads, partially offset by\nstrong securitization\nactivity.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\nincreased 40%, driven by\ngrowth across all products.\nEquity derivatives revenues\nincreased reflecting higher\nclient activity, particularly\nin EMEA and Asia . Prime\nfinance revenues increased due\nto favorable market conditions\nas well as growth in client\nbalances. Cash equities\nrevenues increased modestly\nreflecting higher client\nactivity. Non-interest\nrevenues increased, primarily\nin principal transactions,\nprimarily due to the higher\nclient activity.\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 10%. Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues increased 9%, as an\nincrease in fee revenues from\nboth new and existing clients,\ndriven by growth in assets\nunder custody and settlement\nvolumes, was partially offset\nby lower deposit spreads.\n                               20                               \nExpenses were up 9%, primarily\ndriven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, business-led\ninvestments and higher\nrevenue-related expenses,\npartially offset by efficiency\nsavings.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $46 million compared to\ncosts of $838 million in the\nprior-year period. Net credit\nlosses declined to $40 million\nfrom $326 million in the\nprior-year period, driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality.\n\nThe ACL release for the\nquarter was $0.1 billion,\ncompared to a build of $0.5\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The release was\nprimarily driven by an\nimprovement in portfolio\ncredit quality.

Excluding the impact\nof gains (losses) on loan\nhedges, Banking revenues\nincreased 6%, as growth in\ninvestment banking, the\nprivate bank and corporate\nlending was partially offset\nby a decrease in treasury and\ntrade solutions. Markets and\nsecurities services revenues\ndecreased 11%, primarily\ndriven by normalization in\nfixed income markets revenues\ndue to a strong prior-year\nperformance, partially offset\nby growth in equity markets\nand securities services.\n\nWithin Banking :\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\nincreased 26%. Advisory\nrevenues increased 57%, driven\nby growth in the market\nwallet. Equity underwriting\nrevenues increased 67%,\nprimarily driven by growth in\nthe market wallet in the first\nhalf of 2021, as well as share\ngains. Debt underwriting\nrevenues decreased 2%, driven\nby a decline in wallet share.\n\n\u2022 Treasury and trade solutions\nrevenues decreased 5% (6%\ndecrease excluding the impact\nof FX translation), driven by\nlower cash revenues, partially\noffset by higher trade\nrevenues.

Trade\nrevenues increased, reflecting\nimproved loan spreads.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\ndecreased 19%, including the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges. Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, revenues\nincreased 2%, primarily driven\nby the same factors described\nabove and lower mark-downs on\nthe portfolio, given lower\nvolatility compared to the\nfirst half of 2020 due to the\npandemic.\n\n\u2022 Private bank revenues\nincreased 3%.

Excluding the\nimpact of FX translation,\nrevenues increased 5%, driven\nby the same factors described\nabove.\n\nExpenses increased 7%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation and business-\nled investments, partially\noffset by efficiency savings.\n\nProvisions reflected a net\nbenefit of $2.6 billion,\ncompared to costs of $6.7\nbillion, driven by an ACL\nrelease and lower net credit\nlosses. Net credit losses\ndeclined to $315 million from\n$777 million in the prior-year\nperiod, driven by improvements\nin portfolio credit quality.\nThe ACL release was $2.9\nbillion, compared to a build\nof $5.9 billion in the prior-\nyear period.

These effective\nminimum requirements were\napplicable through September\n30, 2021. See \u201cStress Capital\nBuffer\u201d above for additional\ninformation.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply\nthe modified transition\nprovision related to the\nimpact of the CECL accounting\nstandard on regulatory\ncapital, as provided by the\nU.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule.\nUnder the modified CECL\ntransition provision, the\nchanges in retained earnings\n(after-tax), deferred tax\nassets (DTAs) arising from\ntemporary differences and the\nallowance for credit losses\nupon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date have been\ndeferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per\nyear commencing January 1,\n2022. For the ongoing impact\nof CECL, Citigroup is allowed\nto adjust retained earnings\nand the allowance for credit\nlosses in an amount equal to\n25% of the change in the\nallowance for credit losses\n(pretax) for each period\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The\ncumulative adjustments to\nretained earnings and the\nallowance for credit losses\nbetween January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021 will also\nphase in to regulatory capital\nat 25% per year commencing\nJanuary 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related\nto the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding\nadjustments to average on-\nbalance sheet assets are\nreflected in quarterly\nadjusted average total assets\nand Total Leverage Exposure.\nIn addition, the increase in\nDTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences upon the January\n1, 2020 adoption date has been\ndeducted from risk-weighted\nassets (RWA) and will phase in\nto RWA at 25% per year\ncommencing January 1, 2022.\n\n(3) Citi\u2019s reportable Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital and Tier\n1 Capital ratios were derived\nunder the Basel III\nStandardized Approach as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 and June\n30, 2021, and under the Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches\nframework as of December 31,\n2020, whereas Citi\u2019s\nreportable Total Capital ratio\nwas derived under the Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches\nframework for all periods\npresented.\n\n(4) Tier 1 Leverage ratio\ndenominator. Represents\nquarterly average total assets\nless amounts deducted from\nTier 1 Capital.\n\n(5) Supplementary Leverage\nratio denominator. Commencing\nwith the second quarter of\n2020 and continuing through\nthe first quarter of 2021,\nCitigroup\u2019s Total Leverage\nExposure temporarily excluded\nU.S. Treasuries and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks.

reporting requirements, which differ from those under\nU.S. GAAP.\n\n(2) Citi has elected to apply the modified transition provision\nrelated to the impact of the CECL accounting standard on\nregulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax) and the\nallowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date have been deferred and will phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the\nongoing impact of CECL, Citigroup is allowed to adjust retained\nearnings and the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal\nto 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pretax)\nfor each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021.\nThe cumulative adjustments to retained earnings and the\nallowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December\n31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per\nyear commencing January 1, 2022, along with the deferred impacts\nrelated to the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date.\n\n(3) Includes goodwill \u201cembedded\u201d in the valuation of significant\ncommon stock investments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions.\n           Footnotes continue on the following page.            \n                                                                \n                               25                               \n(4) Of Citi\u2019s $24.5 billion of net DTAs at September 30, 2021,\n$15.3 billion was included in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital\npursuant to the U.S. Basel III rules, while $9.2 billion was\nexcluded. Excluded from Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as\nof September 30, 2021 was $10.9 billion of net DTAs arising from\nnet operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business\ncredit tax carry-forwards. The amount excluded was reduced by\n$1.7 billion of net DTLs primarily associated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible assets that are separately deducted\nfrom capital. DTAs arising from tax carry-forwards are required\nto be entirely deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under\nthe U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary\ndifferences are required to be deducted from capital only if\nthese DTAs exceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S. Basel III\nrules. Citi\u2019s DTAs do not currently exceed these limitations\nand, therefore, are not subject to deduction from Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital, but are subject to risk weighting at 250%.\n\n(5) Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred\nsecurities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1\nCapital under the U.S. Basel III rules.\n\n(6) Banking entities are required to be in compliance with the\nVolcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits conducting\ncertain proprietary investment activities and limits their\nownership of, and relationships with, covered funds. Commencing\nJanuary 1, 2021, Citi no longer deducts permitted market making\npositions in third-party covered funds from Tier 1 Capital, in\naccordance with the revised Volcker Rule 2.0 issued by the U.S.\nagencies in November 2019. Upon the removal of the capital\ndeduction, permitted market making positions in third-party\ncovered funds are included in risk-weighted assets.\n\n(7) Represents the amount of non-grandfathered trust preferred\nsecurities eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital under the\nU.S. Basel III rules, which will be fully phased out of Tier 2\nCapital by January 1, 2022.\n\n(8) Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit\nlosses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25%\nof credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for\ncredit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted\nassets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in\nwhich eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit\nlosses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the\nextent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit\nreserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible\nfor inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under\nthe Advanced Approaches framework was $5.0 billion and $5.1\nbillion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n                               26                               \n

capital requirements\nare inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of\nwhich must be composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital).\n\n(2) Citibank has elected to apply the modified transition\nprovision related to the impact of the CECL accounting standard\non regulatory capital, as provided by the U.S. banking agencies\u2019\nSeptember 2020 final rule. Under the modified CECL transition\nprovision, the changes in retained earnings (after-tax),\ndeferred tax assets (DTAs) arising from temporary differences\nand the allowance for credit losses upon the January 1, 2020\nCECL adoption date have been deferred and will phase in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\nFor the ongoing impact of CECL, Citibank is allowed to adjust\nretained earnings and the allowance for credit losses in an\namount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit\nlosses (pretax) for each period between January 1, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustments to retained\nearnings and the allowance for credit losses between January 1,\n2020 and December 31, 2021 will also phase in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022, along with\nthe deferred impacts related to the January 1, 2020 CECL\nadoption date. Corresponding adjustments to average on-balance\nsheet assets are reflected in quarterly adjusted average total\nassets and Total Leverage Exposure. In addition, the increase in\nDTAs arising from temporary differences upon the January 1, 2020\nadoption date has been deducted from risk-weighted assets (RWA)\nand will phase in to RWA at 25% per year commencing January 1,\n2022.\n\n(3) Under the Advanced Approaches framework, eligible credit\nreserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for\ninclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess\nreserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets,\nwhich differs from the Standardized Approach in which the ACL is\neligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit\nrisk-weighted assets, with any excess ACL being deducted in\narriving at credit risk-weighted assets.\n\n(4) Citibank\u2019s reportable Total Capital ratio was derived under\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches framework, whereas Citibank\u2019s\nreportable Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital\nratios were the lower derived under the Basel III Standardized\nApproach for all periods presented.\n\n(5) Citibank must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Capital,\nTier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Tier 1 Leverage ratios of\n6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)\nregulations applicable to insured depository institutions as\nestablished by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also\nmaintain a minimum Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be\nconsidered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\n\n(6) Tier 1 Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly\naverage total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.\n\n(7) Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator. Citibank did not\nelect to temporarily exclude U.S. Treasuries and deposits at\nFederal Reserve Banks from Total Leverage Exposure.

In addition,\nCitibank was \u201cwell\ncapitalized\u201d as of September\n30, 2021.\n\nImpact of Changes on Citigroup\nand Citibank Capital Ratios\n\nThe following tables present\nthe estimated sensitivity of\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncapital ratios to changes of\n$100 million in Common Equity\nTier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital\nand Total Capital (numerator),\nand changes of $1 billion in\n\nAdvanced Approaches and\nStandardized Approach risk-\nweighted assets and quarterly\nadjusted average total assets,\nas well as Total Leverage\nExposure (denominator), as of\nSeptember 30, 2021.

SA-CCR will replace the\nCurrent Exposure Method, which\nis the current methodology\nused to calculate exposure for\nderivative contracts,\nthroughout the regulatory\nframework. Among other\ninstances, SA-CCR will be used\nfor purposes of calculating\nrisk-weighted assets under the\nStandardized Approach and\nAdvanced Approaches (where\ninternal models are not used),\nas well as Total Leverage\nExposure. The mandatory\ncompliance date of the SA-CCR\nfinal rule is January 1, 2022.\nFor additional information on\nthe SA-CCR final rule, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u2014Regulatory\nCapital Standards\nDevelopments\u2014Standardized\nApproach for Counterparty\nCredit Risk\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nCiti\u2019s adoption of SA-CCR will\nresult in an adverse impact to\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\nregulatory capital ratios in\nthe first quarter of 2022. The\nmagnitude of the impact upon\nadoption remains subject to\nadditional implementation\nplanning and business actions,\nincluding composition of the\nderivatives portfolio as of\nthe adoption date.\n                               34                               \nTangible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Return on\nEquity\n\nTangible common equity (TCE),\nas defined by Citi, represents\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity\nless goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nmortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs)). Tangible book value\nper share, as defined by Citi,\nrepresents TCE divided by\ncommon shares outstanding.\nOther companies may calculate\nTCE in a different manner.\nTCE, tangible book value

Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly, and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. This includes but\nis not limited to exposures in\nthose sectors significantly\nimpacted by the pandemic\n(including consumer retail,\ncommercial real estate and\ntransportation). Citigroup\nbelieves the corporate credit\nportfolio to be appropriately\nrated and classified as of\nSeptember 30, 2021. Since the\nonset of the COVID-19\npandemic, Citigroup has taken\naction to adjust internal\nratings and classifications of\nexposures as both the\nmacroeconomic environment and\nobligor-specific factors have\nchanged, particularly where\nadditional stress has been\nseen. As obligor risk ratings\nare downgraded, the\nprobability of default\nincreases. Downgrades of\nobligor risk ratings tend to\n                               44                               \nresult in a higher provision\nfor credit losses. In\naddition, downgrades may\nresult in the purchase of\nadditional credit derivatives\nor other risk mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

Citi\u2019s\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt is generally driven by\ncustomer demand and\ncomplements benchmark debt\nissuance as a source of\nfunding for Citi\u2019s non-bank\nentities.

As of September 30,\n2021, non-bank included $63.5\nbillion of long-term debt\nissued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer\nand other subsidiaries, as\nwell as certain Citigroup\nconsolidated hedging\nactivities. (2) Local country\nand other includes debt issued\nby Citi\u2019s affiliates in\nsupport of their local\noperations. Within non-bank,\ncertain secured financing is\nalso included. (3)\nPredominantly credit card\nsecuritizations, primarily\nbacked by Citi-branded credit\ncard receivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding\ndecreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by declines\nin unsecured benchmark senior\ndebt, FHLB borrowings and\nsecuritizations at the bank,\npartially offset by the\nissuance of customer-related\ndebt at the non-bank entities.\nSequentially, long-term debt\noutstanding decreased, driven\nprimarily by decreases in FHLB\nborrowings at the bank and\nunsecured benchmark senior\ndebt at the non-bank entities.\nAs part of its liability\nmanagement, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue\nto consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-\nterm debt pursuant to open\nmarket purchases, tender\noffers or other means. Such\nredemptions and repurchases\nhelp reduce Citi\u2019s overall\nfunding costs. During the\nthird quarter of 2021, Citi\nredeemed or repurchased an\naggregate of approximately\n$5.9 billion of its\noutstanding long-term debt.\n                               59

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n\nSecured Funding Transactions\n\nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries to\nfund efficiently both (i)\nsecured lending activity and\n(ii) a portion of the\nsecurities inventory held in\nthe context of market making\nand customer activities. Citi\nalso executes a smaller\nportion of its secured funding\ntransactions through its bank\nentities, which are typically\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\ndaily changes in the level of\nCiti\u2019s secured funding are\nprimarily due to fluctuations\nin secured lending activity in\nthe matched book (as described\nbelow) and securities\ninventory.\n\nSecured funding of $209\nbillion as of September 30,\n2021 increased 1% from the\nprior-year period and\ndecreased 6% sequentially.\nExcluding the impact of FX\ntranslation, secured funding\nwas largely unchanged from the\nprior-year period and\ndecreased 4% sequentially,\ndriven by normal business\nactivity. The average balance\nfor secured funding was\napproximately $229 billion for\nthe quarter ended September\n30, 2021.\n\nThe portion of secured funding\nin the broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries that funds\nsecured lending is commonly\nreferred to as \u201cmatched book\u201d\nactivity. The majority of this\nactivity is secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other secured\nfunding is secured by less\nliquid securities, including\nequity securities, corporate\nbonds and asset-backed\nsecurities, the tenor of which\nis generally equal to or\nlonger than the tenor of the\ncorresponding matched book\nassets.\n\nThe remainder of the secured\nfunding activity in the\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries\nserves to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities. To maintain\nreliable funding under a wide\nrange of market conditions,\nincluding under periods of\nstress, Citi manages these\nactivities by taking into\nconsideration the quality of\nthe underlying collateral and\nestablishing minimum required\nfunding tenors. The weighted\naverage maturity of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding of less liquid\nsecurities inventory was\ngreater than 110 days as of\nSeptember 30, 2021.\n\nCiti manages the risks in its\nsecured funding by conducting\ndaily stress tests to account\nfor changes in capacity,\ntenor, haircut, collateral\nprofile and client actions. In\naddition, Citi maintains\ncounterparty diversification\nby establishing concentration\ntriggers and assessing\ncounterparty reliability and\nstability under stress. Citi\ngenerally sources secured\nfunding from more than 150\ncounterparties.\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $30 billion decreased 21%\nyear-over-year, reflecting a\ndecline in FHLB advances, and\n6% sequentially, driven by a\ndecline in FHLB advances and\nunsecured commercial paper,\npartially offset by increases\nin asset-backed commercial\npaper and structured notes\n(see Note 16 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               61                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Uncertainties\ninclude potential ratings\nlimitations that certain\nentities may have with respect\nto permissible counterparties,\nas well as general subjective\ncounterparty behavior. For\nexample, certain corporate\ncustomers and markets\ncounterparties could re-\nevaluate their business\nrelationships with Citi and\nlimit transactions in certain\ncontracts or market\ninstruments with Citi. Changes\nin counterparty behavior could\nimpact Citi\u2019s funding and\nliquidity, as well as the\nresults of operations of\ncertain of its businesses. The\nactual impact to Citigroup or\nCitibank is unpredictable and\nmay differ materially from the\npotential funding and\nliquidity impacts described\nbelow. For additional\ninformation on the impact of\ncredit rating changes on Citi\nand its applicable\nsubsidiaries, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Liquidity Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and\nCitibank\u2014Potential Derivative\nTriggers\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citigroup Inc. across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould impact Citigroup\u2019s\nfunding and liquidity due to\nderivative triggers by\napproximately $1.1 billion,\ncompared to $1.0 billion as of\nJune 30, 2021. Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfinancing transactions and\nother margin requirements, for\nwhich there are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.5\nbillion, unchanged from June\n30, 2021. Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfunding transactions and other\nmargin requirements, for which\nthere are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of September 30,\n2021, Citi estimates that a\none-notch downgrade of\nCitigroup and Citibank across\nall three major rating\nagencies could result in\nincreased aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$1.6 billion, compared to $1.4\nbillion as of June 30, 2021\n(see also Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements). As detailed under\n\u201cHigh-Quality Liquid Assets\u201d\nabove, Citigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nIn addition, a broad range of\nmitigating actions are\ncurrently included in\nCitigroup\u2019s and Citibank\u2019s\ncontingency funding plans. For\nCitigroup, these mitigating\nfactors include, but are not\nlimited to, accessing surplus\nfunding capacity from existing\nclients, tailoring levels of\nsecured lending and adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nbooks and collateralized\nborrowings at certain Citibank\nsubsidiaries. Mitigating\nactions available to Citibank\ninclude, but are not limited\nto, selling or financing\nhighly liquid government\nsecurities, tailoring levels\nof secured lending, adjusting\nthe size of select trading\nassets, reducing loan\noriginations and renewals,\nraising additional deposits or\nborrowing from the FHLB or\ncentral banks. Citi believes\nthese mitigating actions could\nsubstantially reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above.\n                               62                               \nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021, Citibank\nhad liquidity commitments of\napproximately $10.0 billion to\nconsolidated asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduits,\ncompared to $9.0 billion as of\nJune 30, 2021 (for additional\ninformation, see Note 18 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could re-\nevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis re-evaluation could\nresult in clients\u2019 adjusting\ntheir discretionary deposit\nlevels or changing their\ndepository institution, which\ncould potentially reduce\ncertain deposit levels at\nCitibank. However, Citi could\nchoose to adjust pricing,\noffer alternative deposit\nproducts to its existing\ncustomers or seek to attract\ndeposits from new customers,\nin addition to the mitigating\nactions referenced above.\n                               63                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk emanates from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

The U.S.\ndollar interest rate exposure\nassociated with these\nbusinesses was $(70) million\nfor a 100 bps instantaneous\nincrease in interest rates as\nof September 30, 2021.\n\n(2) Includes the effect of\nchanges in interest rates on\nAOCI related to investment\nsecurities, cash flow hedges\nand pension liability\nadjustments.\n\nThe sequential decline in the\nestimated impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest revenue was driven by\na decline in non-U.S. dollar\nexposure due to an increase in\nnon-U.S. interest rates.\n\nThe modest sequential decline\nin the estimated impact to\nAOCI primarily reflected a\ncontinuation of the\npositioning strategy of Citi\nTreasury\u2019s investment\nsecurities and related\ninterest rate derivatives\nportfolio.\n\nIn the event of a parallel\ninstantaneous 100 bps increase\nin interest rates, as of\nSeptember 30, 2021, Citi\nexpects that the $4.9 billion\nnegative impact to AOCI would\nbe offset in stockholders\u2019\nequity through the expected\nrecovery of the impact on AOCI\nthrough accretion of Citi\u2019s\ninvestment portfolio over\napproximately 37 months.\n\nThe following table sets forth\nthe estimated impact to Citi\u2019s\nnet interest revenue, AOCI and\nthe Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio (on a fully\nimplemented basis) under five\ndifferent changes in interest\nrate scenarios for the U.S.\ndollar and Citi\u2019s other\ncurrencies. The 100 bps\ndownward rate scenarios are\nimpacted by the low level of\ninterest rates in several\ncountries and the assumption\nthat market interest rates, as\nwell as rates paid to\ndepositors and charged to\nborrowers, do not fall below\nzero (i.e., the \u201cflooring\nassumption\u201d).

This is because\nthe combination of changes to\nCiti\u2019s investment portfolio,\npartially offset by changes\nrelated to Citi\u2019s pension\nliabilities, results in a net\nposition that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n\nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.5 billion,\nor 0.9%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s foreign\ncurrency translation\nadjustment in AOCI , net of\nhedges. This impact would be\nprimarily due to changes in\nthe value of the Mexican peso,\nEuro and Indian rupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency translation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies. This, coupled with\nCiti\u2019s foreign currency\nhedging strategies, such as\nforeign currency borrowings,\nforeign currency forwards and\nother currency hedging\ninstruments, lessens the\nimpact of foreign currency\nmovements on Citi\u2019s Common\nEquity Tier 1 Capital ratio.\nChanges in these hedging\nstrategies, as well as hedging\ncosts, divestitures and tax\nimpacts, can further affect\nthe actual impact of changes\nin foreign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital as compared to\nan unanticipated parallel\nshock, as described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to changes in foreign\nexchange rates, and the impact\nof these changes on Citi\u2019s TCE\nand Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

As of June 30, 2021, the add-on was 35%.\n\nAs set forth in the table below, Citi\u2019s average trading VAR\ndecreased quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to a reduction in\ninterest rate short hedges as well as a general reduction in\ninterest rate risk, both in ICG Markets businesses.

Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not\nincluded.\n\n(3) The specific risk-only component represents the level of\nequity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VAR.\n\n(4) The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions\nassociated with non-trading business units including Citi\nTreasury, the CVA relating to derivative counterparties and all\nassociated CVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit\nportfolio also includes hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value\noption loans and hedges to the leveraged finance pipeline within\ncapital markets origination in ICG .\n\nThe table below provides the range of market factor VARs\nassociated with Citi\u2019s total trading VAR, inclusive of specific\nrisk:\n                                                                \n  In       Th\u2026                 S\u2026                 T\u2026            \n  m\u2026       Qu\u2026                 Q\u2026                 Q\u2026            \n  of       20\u2026                 2\u2026                 2\u2026            \n  d\u2026       Low       Hi\u2026       L\u2026       Hi\u2026       L\u2026       Hi\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  I\u2026    $   51    $   76    $  57    $   96    $  61    $  111  \n  r\u2026                                                            \n  C\u2026        62        96       65        86       67        95  \n  s\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026                                                            \n  d\u2026                                                            \n  i\u2026                                                            \n  r\u2026    $   77    $  115    $  90    $  123    $  83    $  128  \n  a\u2026                                                            \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  s\u2026                                                            \n  F\u2026        38        46       34        48       15        31  \n  e\u2026                                                            \n  E\u2026        24        50       23        43       22        33  \n  C\u2026        27        55       26        50       21        32  \n  T\u2026    $   86    $  120    $  90    $  130    $  87    $  128  \n  t\u2026                                                            \n  T\u2026                                                            \n  t\u2026                                                            \n  a\u2026       114       166       1\u2026       159       1\u2026       150  \n  c\u2026                                                            \n  p\u2026                                                            \n                                                                \nNote: No covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above\ntable as the high and low for each market factor will be from\ndifferent close-of-business dates.\n                               76                               \nThe following table provides\nthe VAR for ICG , excluding\nthe CVA relating to derivative\ncounterparties, hedges of CVA,\nfair value option loans and\nhedges to the loan portfolio:\n                                                                \n  In millions of dollars                    September 30, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Total\u2014all market risk factors,                                \n  including                                                     \n  general and specific risk                                     \n  Average\u2014during quarter                 $                 102  \n  High\u2014during quarter                                      121  \n  Low\u2014during quarter                                        87  \n                                                                \nRegulatory VAR Back-testing In\naccordance with Basel III,\nCiti is required to perform\nback-testing to evaluate the\neffectiveness of its\nRegulatory VAR model.\nRegulatory VAR back-testing is\nthe process in which the daily\none-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is\ncompared to the buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss (i.e., the\nprofit and loss impact if the\nportfolio is held constant at\nthe end of the day and re-\npriced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss\nrepresents the daily mark-to-\nmarket profit and loss\nattributable to price\nmovements in covered positions\nfrom the close of the previous\nbusiness day. Buy-and-hold\nprofit and loss excludes\nrealized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and\ncommissions, intra-day trading\nprofit and loss and changes in\nreserves. Based on a 99%\nconfidence level, Citi would\nexpect two to three days in\nany one year where buy-and-\nhold losses exceed the\nRegulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of\nCiti\u2019s VAR model (as a result\nof taking the greater of\nshort- and long-term\nvolatilities and fat-tail\nscaling of volatilities), Citi\nwould expect fewer exceptions\nunder normal and stable market\nconditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions\ncould increase the number of\nback-testing exceptions. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021, there were\nno back-testing exceptions\nobserved for Citi\u2019s Regulatory\nVAR for the prior 12 months.\n                               77                               \n                                                                \n  STRATEGIC RISK                                                \n                                                                \nFor additional information\nregarding strategic risk,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of\nstrategic risk, see \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Strategic Risk\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s First Quarter of 2021\nForm 10-Q and Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Country Risk                                                  \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Top 25 Country Exposures                                      \n                                                                \nThe following table presents\nCiti\u2019s top 25 exposures by\ncountry (excluding the U.S.)\nas of September 30, 2021.\n(Including the U.S, the total\nexposure as of September 30,\n2021 to the top 25 countries\nwould represent approximately\n96% of Citi\u2019s exposure to all\ncountries.)\n\nFor purposes of the table,\nloan amounts are reflected in\nthe country where the loan is\nbooked, which is generally\nbased on the domicile of the\nborrower. For example, a loan\nto a\n\nChinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries, most\nsignificantly in the United\nKingdom (U.K.) and Ireland, in\norder to more efficiently\nserve its corporate customers.\nAs an example, with respect to\nthe U.K., only 32% of\ncorporate loans presented in\nthe table below are to U.K.\ndomiciled entities (32% for\nunfunded commitments), with\nthe balance of the loans\npredominately to European\ndomiciled counterparties.\nApproximately 84% of the total\nU.K. funded loans and 84% of\nthe total U.K. unfunded\ncommitments were investment\ngrade as of September 30,\n2021.\n\nTrading account assets and\ninvestment securities are\ngenerally categorized based on\nthe domicile of the issuer of\nthe security of the underlying\nreference entity.

As\nof September 30, 2021, Citi\u2019s\nnet investment in its\nArgentine operations was\napproximately $1.3 billion.\nCiti uses the U.S. dollar as\nthe functional currency for\nits operations in highly\ninflationary countries under\nU.S. GAAP. Citi uses\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate to remeasure its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets into the U.S. dollar.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the\nofficial Argentine peso\nexchange rate against the U.S.\ndollar was 98.74.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nCentral Bank of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat restrict Citi\u2019s ability\nto access U.S. dollars in\nArgentina and remit earnings\nfrom its Argentine operations.\nCiti\u2019s net investment in its\nArgentine operations is likely\nto increase as Citi generates\nnet income in its Argentine\nfranchise and its earnings\ncannot be remitted.\n\nDue to the currency controls\nimplemented by the Central\nBank of Argentina, certain\nindirect foreign exchange\nmechanisms have developed that\nsome Argentine entities may\nuse to obtain U.S. dollars,\ngenerally at rates that are\nsignificantly higher than\nArgentina\u2019s official exchange\nrate. Citibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti economically hedges the\nforeign currency risk in its\nnet Argentine peso-denominated\nassets to the extent possible\nand prudent using non-\ndeliverable forward (NDF)\nderivative instruments that\nare primarily executed outside\nof Argentina. As of September\n30, 2021, the international\nNDF market had very limited\nliquidity, resulting in Citi\nbeing unable to economically\nhedge nearly all of its\nArgentine peso exposure. As a\nresult, and to the extent that\nCiti does not execute NDF\ncontracts for this unhedged\nexposure in the future, Citi\nwould record devaluations on\nits net Argentine\npeso\u2010denominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and sovereign risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished appropriate\nallowances for credit losses\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\nsuch risks under U.S. GAAP as\nof September 30, 2021.\nHowever, U.S. regulatory\nagencies may require Citi to\nrecord additional reserves in\nthe future, increasing ICG \u2019s\ncost of credit, based on the\nperceived country risk\nassociated with its Argentine\nexposures.

Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K\ncontains a summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCitigroup\u2019s 2020 Annual Report\non Form 10-K). Management has\ndiscussed each of these\nsignificant accounting\npolicies, the related\nestimates and its judgments\nwith the Audit Committee of\nthe Citigroup Board of\nDirectors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based upon internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. The fair value of\nthese instruments is reported\non Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet with the changes in fair\nvalue recognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nare recognized in earnings.\nWhere Citi does not intend to\nsell the security nor could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security,\nthe portion of the loss\nrelated to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAdjudicating the temporary\nnature of fair value\nimpairments is also inherently\njudgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in this Form 10-Q\nand Note 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2020 Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n                               80                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below shows Citi\u2019s\nACL as of the third quarter of\n2021.

In addition,\nCiti reserves for expected\ncredit losses on other\nfinancial assets carried at\namortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables. These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses a forward-\nlooking base macroeconomic\nforecast. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent reflects economic\nuncertainty using alternative\ndownside macroeconomic\nscenarios and portfolio\ncharacteristics and current\neconomic conditions not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as adjustments\nto reflect uncertainty around\nthe estimated impact of the\npandemic on credit losses.\nBoth the quantitative and\nqualitative management\nadjustment components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation, and (iv) a\nreasonable and supportable\nforecast of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default (PD),\nloss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD). The\nloss likelihood and severity\nmodels used for estimating\nexpected credit losses are\nsensitive to changes in\nmacroeconomic variables that\ninform the forecasts, and\ncover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency, risk ratings and\nloss recovery rates (among\nother things), as well as\nother current economic factors\nand credit trends, including\nhousing prices, unemployment\nand gross domestic product\n(GDP).\n                               81                               \nQualitative Component The\nqualitative management\nadjustment component includes,\namong other things, management\nadjustments to reflect\neconomic uncertainty based on\nthe likelihood and severity of\ndownside scenarios and certain\nportfolio characteristics not\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as\nconcentrations, collateral\nvaluation, model limitations,\nidiosyncratic events and other\nfactors as required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponent also reflects the\nuncertainty around the\nestimated impact of the\npandemic on credit loss\nestimates. The ultimate extent\nof the pandemic\u2019s impact on\nCiti\u2019s ACL will depend on,\namong other things, (i) how\nconsumers respond to the\nconclusion of government\nstimulus and assistance\nprograms, (ii) the impact on\nunemployment, (iii) the timing\nand extent of the economic\nrecovery, (iv) the severity\nand duration of any resurgence\nof COVID-19, (v) the rate of\ndistribution and\nadministration of vaccines and\n(vi) the extent of any market\nvolatility. 3Q21 Changes in\nthe Allowance In the third\nquarter of 2021, Citi released\n$1.1 billion of the ACL for\nits consumer portfolios and\n$0.1 billion of the ACL for\nits corporate portfolios, for\na total release of $1.2\nbillion. The release in the\nconsumer ACL was driven\nprimarily by continued\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality, as well as the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook. The\nrelease in the corporate ACL\nwas also driven primarily by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality. The overall\nqualitative management\nadjustments declined compared\nto the previous quarter. Based\non its latest macroeconomic\nforecast, Citi believes its\nanalysis of the ACL reflects\nthe forward view of the\neconomic environment as of\nSeptember 30, 2021.\n\nMacroeconomic Variables Citi\nconsiders a multitude of\nmacroeconomic variables for\nboth the base and downside\nmacroeconomic forecasts it\nuses to estimate the ACL,\nincluding domestic and\ninternational variables for\nits global portfolios and\nexposures. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. Real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL.

Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 3Q21, U.S. Real GDP growth\nis expected to remain strong\nduring the remainder of 2021\nand in 2022, and the\nunemployment rate is expected\nto continue to improve as the\nU.S. moves past the peak of\nthe pandemic-related health\nand economic crisis. Consumer\nAs discussed above, Citi\u2019s\ntotal consumer ACL release\n(including Corporate/Other )\nof $1.1 billion in the third\nquarter of 2021 reduced the\nACL balance to $14.7 billion,\nor 5.55% of total consumer\nloans at September 30, 2021.\nThe release was primarily\ndriven by the continued\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality, as well as the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic outlook. Citi\u2019s\nconsumer ACL is largely driven\nby the cards businesses. For\ncards, including Citi\u2019s\ninternational businesses, the\nlevel of reserves relative to\nEOP loans decreased to 9.09%\nat September 30, 2021,\ncompared to 9.72% at June 30,\n2021, primarily driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality, as well as the\ncontinued improvement in the\nmacroeconomic\n                               82                               \noutlook. For the remaining\nconsumer exposures, the level\nof reserves relative to EOP\nloans decreased to 1.4% at\nSeptember 30, 2021, compared\nto 1.5% at June 30, 2021.\n\nCorporate\n\nCiti\u2019s corporate ACLL release\nof $0.1 billion in the third\nquarter of 2021 reduced the\nACLL reserve balance to $3.0\nbillion, or 0.77% of total\nfunded loans, and was\nprimarily driven by\nimprovements in portfolio\ncredit quality.\n\nThe Allowance for credit\nlosses on unfunded lending\ncommitments (ACLUC) release of\n$14 million in the third\nquarter of 2021 decreased the\ntotal ACLUC reserve balance\nincluded in Other liabilities\nto $2.1 billion at September\n30, 2021.\n                                                                \n  ACLL and Non-accrual Ratios                                   \n                                                                \nAt September 30, 2021, the\nratio of the allowance for\ncredit losses to total funded\nloans was 2.69% (5.55% for\nconsumer loans and 0.77% for\ncorporate loans) compared to\n2.88% at June 30, 2021 (5.84%\nfor consumer loans and 0.80%\nfor corporate loans).\n\nCiti\u2019s total non-accrual loans\nwere $4.0 billion at September\n30, 2021, down $393 million\nfrom June 30, 2021. Consumer\nnon-accrual loans decreased\n$217 million to $1.6 billion\nat September 30, 2021 from\n$1.8 billion at June 30, 2021,\nwhile corporate non-accrual\nloans decreased $176 million\nto $2.4 billion at September\n30, 2021 from $2.6 billion at\nJune 30, 2021. In addition,\nthe ratio of non-accrual loans\nto total corporate loans was\n0.60%, and 0.60% of non-\naccrual loans to total\nconsumer loans, at September\n30, 2021.\n                                                                \n  Regulatory Capital Impact                                     \n                                                                \nCiti has elected to phase in\nthe CECL impact for regulatory\ncapital purposes. The\ntransition provisions were\nrecently modified to defer the\nphase-in. After two years with\nno impact on capital, the CECL\ntransition impact will phase\nin over a three-year\ntransition period with 25% of\nthe impact (net of deferred\ntaxes) recognized on the first\nday of each subsequent year,\ncommencing January 1, 2022,\nand will be fully implemented\non January 1, 2025. In\naddition, 25% of the build\n(pretax) made in 2020 and 2021\nwill be deferred and amortized\nover the same timeframe.\n\nFor a further description of\nthe ACL and related accounts,\nsee Notes 1 and 14 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nFor a discussion of the\nadoption of the CECL\naccounting pronouncement, see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n                                                                \n  Goodwill                                                      \n                                                                \nCiti tests goodwill for\nimpairment annually as of July\n1 (the annual test) and\nthrough interim assessments\nbetween annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more-likely-\nthan-not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its\ncarrying amount, such as a\nsignificant adverse change in\nthe business climate, a\ndecision to sell or dispose of\nall or a significant portion\nof a reporting unit or a\nsignificant decline in Citi\u2019s\nstock price.\n\nCiti performed its annual\ngoodwill impairment test as of\nJuly 1, 2021. The fair values\nof the Company\u2019s reporting\nunits as a percentage of their\ncarrying values ranged from\napproximately 125% to 153%,\nresulting in no impairment.\nWhile the inherent risk\nrelated to uncertainty is\nembedded in the key\nassumptions used in the\nvaluations, the economic and\nbusiness environment continue\nto evolve as management\nprogresses on its strategic\nrefresh, including, among\nothers, the exits of consumer\nbusinesses in 13 markets in\nAsia and EMEA . If\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of\nfuture key economic and market\nassumptions were to differ\nfrom current assumptions, Citi\ncould potentially experience\nmaterial goodwill impairment\ncharges in the future.

Excluded from Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 was $10.9 billion of net DTAs arising from\nnet operating losses, foreign tax credit (FTC) and general\nbusiness credit carry-forwards, which decreased by $0.3 billion\nin the current quarter. The amount excluded was reduced by $1.7\nbillion of net DTLs, primarily associated with goodwill and\ncertain other intangible assets, that are separately deducted\nfrom capital. Net DTAs arising from temporary differences are\ndeducted from regulatory capital if in excess of the 10%/15%\nlimitations (see \u201cCapital Resources\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2020 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K). For the quarter ended September 30, 2021,\nCiti did not have any such DTAs. Accordingly, the remaining\n$15.3 billion of net DTAs as of September 30, 2021 was not\ndeducted in calculating regulatory capital pursuant to Basel III\nstandards and was appropriately risk weighted under those rules.\n\nDTA Realizability Citi believes that the realization of the\nrecognized net DTAs of $24.5 billion at September 30, 2021 is\nmore-likely-than-not based on management\u2019s expectations as to\nfuture taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs\narise, as well as consideration of available tax planning\nstrategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ). In the\nthird quarter of 2021, there was no change in Citi\u2019s DTA\nvaluation allowance (VA) requirements for foreign tax credit\ncarry-forwards. As part of its normal planning process in the\nfourth quarter of 2021, Citi expects to further update its\nforecasts of operating income and foreign source income, which\nin turn could affect Citi\u2019s valuation allowance against FTC\ncarry-forwards. Effective Tax Rate Citi\u2019s reported effective tax\nrate for the third quarter of 2021 was approximately 20%,\nlargely unchanged from the third quarter of 2020.\n                               84                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures.

In\nthe opinion of management, all\nadjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded in Citigroup\u2019s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31,\n2020 (2020 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K) and Citigroup\u2019s\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended March\n31, 2021 (First Quarter of\n2021 Form 10-Q) and for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2021\n(Second Quarter of 2021 Form\n10-Q). Certain financial\ninformation that is normally\nincluded in annual financial\nstatements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), but is not required\nfor interim reporting\npurposes, has been condensed\nor omitted. Management must\nmake estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and the\nrelated footnote disclosures.\nWhile management uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT\nACCOUNTING POLICIES See Note 1\nto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\na summary of all of\nCitigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies.\n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES Accounting\nfor Financial Instruments \u2014\nCredit Losses Overview In June\n2016, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) issued\nASU No. 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments \u2014 Credit Losses\n(Topic 326). The ASU\nintroduced a new credit loss\nmethodology, the current\nexpected credit losses (CECL)\nmethodology, which requires\nearlier recognition of credit\nlosses while also providing\nadditional disclosure about\ncredit risk. Citi adopted the\nASU as of January 1, 2020,\nwhich, as discussed below,\nresulted in an increase in\nCiti\u2019s Allowance for credit\nlosses and a decrease to\nopening Retained earnings ,\nnet of deferred income taxes,\nat January 1, 2020. The CECL\nmethodology utilizes a\nlifetime \u201cexpected credit\nloss\u201d measurement objective\nfor the recognition of credit\nlosses for loans, held-to-\nmaturity debt securities,\nreceivables and other\nfinancial assets measured at\namortized cost at the time the\nfinancial asset is originated\nor acquired. The ACL is\nadjusted each period for\nchanges in lifetime expected\ncredit losses. The CECL\nmethodology represents a\nsignificant change from prior\nU.S. GAAP and replaced the\nprior multiple existing\nimpairment methods, which\ngenerally required that a loss\nbe incurred before it was\nrecognized. Within the life\ncycle of a loan or other\nfinancial asset, the\nmethodology generally results\nin an earlier recognition of\nthe provision for credit\nlosses and the related ACL\nthan prior U.S. GAAP. For\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities where fair value is\nless than cost that Citi\nintends to hold or more-\nlikely-than-not will not be\nrequired to sell, credit-\nrelated impairment, if any, is\nrecognized through an ACL and\nadjusted each period for\nchanges in credit risk.\nJanuary 1, 2020 CECL\nTransition (Day 1) Impact The\nCECL methodology\u2019s impact on\nexpected credit losses, among\nother things, reflects Citi\u2019s\nview of the current state of\nthe economy, forecasted\nmacroeconomic conditions and\nquality of Citi\u2019s portfolios.\nAt the January 1, 2020 date of\nadoption, based on forecasts\nof macroeconomic conditions\nand exposures at that time,\nthe aggregate impact to Citi\nwas an approximate $\n4.1billion, or an approximate\n29%, pretax increase in the\nAllowance for credit losses ,\nalong with a $ 3.1billion\nafter-tax decrease in Retained\nearnings and a deferred tax\nasset increase of $\n1.0billion. This transition\nimpact reflects (i) a $\n4.9billion build to the\nAllowance for credit losses\nfor Citi\u2019s consumer exposures,\nprimarily driven by the impact\non credit card receivables of\nlonger estimated tenors under\nthe CECL lifetime expected\ncredit loss methodology (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n23months) compared to shorter\nestimated tenors under the\nprobable loss methodology\nunder prior U.S. GAAP (loss\ncoverage of approximately\n14months), net of recoveries;\nand (ii) a release of $\n0.8billion of reserves\nprimarily related to Citi\u2019s\ncorporate net loan loss\nexposures, largely due to more\nprecise contractual maturities\nthat result in shorter\nremaining tenors,\nincorporation of recoveries\nand use of more specific\nhistorical loss data based\n                               98                               \non an increase in portfolio segmentation across industries and\ngeographies. Under the CECL methodology, the Allowance for\ncredit losses consists of quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents. Citi\u2019s quantitative component of the Allowance for\ncredit losses is model based and utilizes a single forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast and discounts inputs for the\ncorporate classifiably managed portfolios, complemented by the\nqualitative component described below, in estimating expected\ncredit losses and discounts inputs for the corporate\nclassifiably managed portfolios. Reasonable and supportable\nforecast periods vary by product. For example, Citi\u2019s consumer\nmodels use a 13-quarter reasonable and supportable period and\nrevert to historical loss experience thereafter, while its\ncorporate loan models use a nine-quarter reasonable and\nsupportable period followed by a three-quarter graduated\ntransition to historical loss experience. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment component includes, among other things,\nmanagement adjustments to reflect economic uncertainty based on\nthe likelihood and severity of downside scenarios and certain\nportfolio characteristics not captured in the quantitative\ncomponent, such as concentrations, collateral coverage, model\nlimitations, idiosyncratic events and other factors as required\nby banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The qualitative\nmanagement adjustment component also includes management\nadjustments to reflect the uncertainty around the estimated\nimpact of the pandemic on credit loss estimates. Accounting for\nVariable Post-Charge-Off Third-Party Collection Costs In the\nfourth quarter of 2020, Citi revised the 2020 second quarter\naccounting conclusion for its variable post-charge-off third-\nparty collection costs from a \u201cchange in accounting estimate\neffected by a change in accounting principle\u201d to a \u201cchange in\naccounting principle,\u201d which required an adjustment to January\n1, 2020 opening retained earnings, rather than 2020 net income.\nAs a result, Citi\u2019s full-year and quarterly results for 2020\nwere revised to reflect this change as if it were effective as\nof January 1, 2020, as follows: \u2022 An increase to beginning\nretained earnings on January 1, 2020 of $ 330million and a\ndecrease of $ 443million in the allowance for credit losses on\nloans, as well as a $ 113million decrease in other assets\nrelated to income taxes. \u2022 A decrease of $ 18million to\nprovisions for credit losses on loans in the first quarter and\nincreases of $ 339million and $ 122million to provisions for\ncredit losses on loans in the second and third quarters,\nrespectively. \u2022 Increases in operating expenses of $ 49million\nand $ 45million with a corresponding decrease in net credit\nlosses, in the first and second quarters, respectively. In\nmaking these revisions, Citi considered the guidance in ASC\nTopic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections ; ASC Topic\n270, Interim Reporting ; ASC Topic 250-S99-1, Assessing\nMateriality ; and ASC Topic 250-S99-23, Accounting Changes Not\nRetroactively Applied Due to Immateriality, Considering the\nEffects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying\nMisstatements in Current Year Financial Statements . Citi\nbelieves that the effects of the revisions were not material to\nany previously reported quarterly or annual period. Reference\nRate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects\nof Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides\noptional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for\n(or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on\nfinancial reporting. Specifically, the guidance permits an\nentity, when certain criteria are met, to consider amendments to\ncontracts made to comply with reference rate reform to meet the\ndefinition of a modification under U.S. GAAP. It further allows\nhedge accounting to be maintained and permits a one-time\ntransfer or sale of qualifying held-to-maturity securities.

The sale,\nwhich is subject to regulatory\napprovals and other customary\nclosing conditions, is\nexpected to close in the first\nhalf of 2022. As of the third\nquarter of 2021, Citi reported\nthe business as held-for-sale,\nresulting in a pretax loss on\nsale of approximately $\n680million recorded in Other\nrevenue ($ 580million after-\ntax), subject to closing\nadjustments. The loss on sale\nprimarily reflects the impact\nof a pretax $ 625million\ncurrency translation\nadjustment (CTA) loss (net of\nhedges) ($ 475million after-\ntax) already reflected in the\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive income ( AOCI )\ncomponent of equity.

In\nconnection with the\nannouncement, Citibank Korea\nInc. (CKI) has commenced a\nvoluntary termination program.\nDue to the voluntary nature of\nthis termination program, no\nliabilities for termination\nbenefits are recorded until\nCKI makes formal offers to\nemployees that are then\nirrevocably accepted by the\nemployees. Citi expects to\nincur total estimated cash\ncharges ranging from\napproximately $ 1.2billion to\n$ 1.5billion, related to\nvoluntary termination benefits\nand related costs. Citi does\nnot expect to recognize these\ncharges all at once, but over\ntime through the remainder of\n2021 and 2022, as voluntary\nretirements are phased and\nirrevocably accepted in order\nto minimize business and\noperational impacts.\n                              101                               \n                                                                \n  3.

These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner-sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that the increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa. Further, in some instances, other\npartner payments are based on program sales and new account\nacquisitions.\n(2) Includes overdraft fees of $ 28million and $ 23million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, and $ 75million and $ 74million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOverdraft fees are accounted for under ASC 310.\n(3) Consists primarily of fees earned from structuring and\nunderwriting loan syndications or related financing activity.\nThis activity is accounted for under ASC 310.\n(4) Commissions and fees include $( 2,208) million and $( 1,816)\nmillion not accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers , for the three months ended September 30, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, and $( 6,031) million and $( 5,044)\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.

For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value, as described in Notes 20 and 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The remaining portion is\ncarried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 21 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. With respect to securities\nloaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount\ngenerally in excess of the market value of the securities\nloaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities\nborrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and posts or\nobtains additional collateral in order to maintain contractual\nmargin protection. The following tables present the gross and\nnet resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing\nand lending agreements and the related offsetting amounts\npermitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include amounts\nrelated to financial instruments that are not permitted to be\noffset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for offsetting\nto the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal\nopinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting rights has\nbeen obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be secured by\nfinancial collateral, but the Company may not have sought or\nbeen able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing enforceability of\nthe offsetting right.\n

An AFS debt security is impaired\nwhen the current fair value of an individual AFS debt security\nis less than its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes\nthe entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair\nvalue in earnings for impaired AFS debt securities that Citi has\nan intent to sell or for which Citi believes it will more-\nlikely-than-not be required to sell prior to recovery of the\namortized cost basis. However, for those AFS debt securities\nthat the Company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be\nrequired to sell, only the credit-related impairment is\nrecognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit\nlosses. Any remaining fair value decline for such securities is\nrecorded in AOCI . The Company does not consider the length of\ntime that the fair value of a security is below its amortized\ncost when determining if a credit loss exists. For AFS debt\nsecurities, credit losses exist where Citi does not expect to\nreceive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient\nto recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security. The\nallowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which\nthe AFS debt security\u2019s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair\nvalue. The allowance is increased or decreased if credit\nconditions subsequently worsen or improve. Reversals of credit\nlosses are recognized in earnings. The Company\u2019s review for\nimpairment of AFS debt securities generally entails: \u2022\nidentification and evaluation of impaired investments; \u2022\nconsideration of evidential matter, including an evaluation of\nfactors or triggers that could cause individual positions to\nqualify as credit impaired and those that would not support\ncredit impairment; and \u2022 documentation of the results of these\nanalyses, as required under Citi\u2019s policies. The sections below\ndescribe the Company\u2019s process for identifying expected credit\nimpairments for debt security types that have the most\nsignificant unrealized losses as of September 30, 2021.\nMortgage-Backed Securities Citi records no allowances for credit\nlosses on U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities, because the Company expects to incur no credit\nlosses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no\ncredit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties. State\nand Municipal Securities The process for estimating credit\nlosses in Citigroup\u2019s AFS state and municipal bonds is primarily\nbased on a credit analysis that incorporates third-party credit\nratings. Citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers\nproviding default protection in the form of financial guarantee\ninsurance. The average external credit rating, ignoring any\ninsurance, is Aa2/AA. In the event of an external rating\ndowngrade or other indicator of credit impairment (i.e., based\non instrument-specific estimates of cash flows or probability of\nissuer default), the subject bond is specifically reviewed for\nadverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual\nprincipal and interest payments. For AFS state and municipal\nbonds with unrealized losses that Citi plans to sell or would\nmore-likely-than-not be required to sell, the full impairment is\nrecognized in earnings. For AFS state and municipal bonds where\nCiti has no intent to sell and it is more-likely-than-not that\nthe Company will not be required to sell, Citi records an\nallowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects\nnot to collect, capped at the difference between the bond\u2019s\namortized cost basis and fair value. Equity Method Investments\nManagement assesses equity method investments that have fair\nvalues that are less than their respective carrying values for\nother-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Fair value is measured\nas price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly\nlisted securities. If the investee is not publicly listed, other\nmethods are used (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements). For impaired equity method investments that Citi\nplans to sell prior to recovery of value or would more-likely-\nthan-not be required to sell, with no expectation that the fair\nvalue will recover prior to the expected sale date, the full\nimpairment is recognized as OTTI in Other revenue regardless of\nseverity and duration. The measurement of the OTTI does not\ninclude partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance\nsheet date. For impaired equity method investments that\nmanagement does not plan to sell and is not more-likely-than-not\nto be required to sell prior to recovery of value, the\nevaluation of whether an impairment is other-than-temporary is\nbased on (i) whether and when an equity method investment will\nrecover in value and (ii) whether the investor has the intent\nand ability to hold that investment for a period of time\nsufficient to recover the value. The determination of whether\nthe impairment is considered other-than-temporary considers the\nfollowing indicators: \u2022 the cause of the impairment and the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer,\nincluding any specific events that may influence the operations\nof the issuer; \u2022 the intent and ability to hold the investment\nfor a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in market value; and \u2022 the length of time and extent to\nwhich fair value has been less than the carrying value.\n                              122

Equity\nSecurities Not Carried at Fair\nValue Non-marketable equity\nsecurities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost. The election to measure\na non-marketable equity\nsecurity using the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired.\nImpairment indicators that are\nconsidered include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n\u2022 a significant deterioration\nin the earnings performance,\ncredit rating, asset quality\nor business prospects of the\ninvestee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the\nregulatory, economic or\ntechnological environment of\nthe investee; \u2022 a significant\nadverse change in the general\nmarket condition of either the\ngeographical area or the\nindustry in which the investee\noperates; \u2022 a bona fide offer\nto purchase, an offer by the\ninvestee to sell or a\ncompleted auction process for\nthe same or similar investment\nfor an amount less than the\ncarrying amount of that\ninvestment; and \u2022 factors that\nraise significant concerns\nabout the investee\u2019s ability\nto continue as a going\nconcern, such as negative cash\nflows from operations, working\ncapital deficiencies or\nnoncompliance with statutory\ncapital requirements or debt\ncovenants. When the\nqualitative assessment\nindicates that impairment\nexists, the investment is\nwritten down to fair value,\nwith the full difference\nbetween the fair value of the\ninvestment and its carrying\namount recognized in earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities\nmeasured using the measurement alternative at September 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020:\n                                                                \n  In millions of         September 30,                          \n  dollars                         2021       December 31, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value      $          1,392    $                962  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative:\n                                                                \n  In                Three                      Nine             \n  millio\u2026          Months                    Months             \n  of                Ended                     Ended             \n  dollars       September                  Septemb\u2026             \n  Measur\u2026             30,                       30,             \n  altern\u2026            2021       2020           2021       2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impair\u2026    $          9    $     2    $        13    $    55  \n  losses                                                        \n  Downwa\u2026                                                       \n  changes                                                       \n  for                   \u2014          \u2014              \u2014         19  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n  Upward                                                        \n  changes                                                       \n  for                  86         40            382         82  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information on these nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                    September 30, 2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                           76  \n  Downward changes for                                      53  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       861  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

The fair\nvalues of these investments are estimated using the NAV of the\nCompany\u2019s ownership interest in the funds. Some of these\ninvestments are in \u201ccovered funds\u201d for purposes of the Volcker\nRule, which prohibits certain proprietary investment activities\nand limits the ownership of, and relationships with, covered\nfunds.

past due are generally\nclassified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past\ndue when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90\ndays or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectability of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest and/or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(4) Total loans include loans at fair value, which are not\nincluded in the various delinquency columns.\n                              138

modifications that meet\nthe TDR relief criteria in the CARES Act or the interagency\nguidance.\n(2) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of principal\npayments may involve principal forgiveness or deferral of\nperiodic and/or final principal payments. Because forgiveness of\nprincipal is rare for corporate loans, modifications typically\nhave little to no impact on the loans\u2019 projected cash flows and\nthus little to no impact on the allowance established for the\nloans. Charge-offs for amounts deemed uncollectible may be\nrecorded at the time of the restructuring or may have already\nbeen recorded in prior periods such that no charge-off is\nrequired at the time of the modification.\n(3) TDRs involving changes in the amount or timing of interest\npayments may involve a below-market interest rate.\n                              142                               \nThe following table presents total corporate loans modified in a\nTDR as well as those TDRs that defaulted and for which the\npayment default occurred within one yearof a permanent\nmodification.

The fair values of the Company\u2019s\nreporting units as percentage of their carrying values ranged\nfrom approximately 125% to 153%, resulting in no impairment.\nWhile the inherent risk related to uncertainty is embedded in\nthe key assumptions used in the valuations, the economic and\nbusiness environment continue to evolve as management progresses\non its strategic refresh, including, among others, the exits of\nconsumer businesses in 13 markets in Asia and EMEA . If\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of future key economic and market\nassumptions were to differ from current assumptions, Citi could\npotentially experience material goodwill impairment charges in\nthe future.

Citigroup\u2019s September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the\nCompany has any variable interest or continuing involvement\nconsidered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated. See \u201cRe-securitizations\u201d below for\nfurther discussion.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 115billion and $\n78billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 507million and $\n425million in maximum exposure to loss as of September 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, respectively.\n                              157                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain venture capital\ninvestments made by some of the Company\u2019s private equity\nsubsidiaries, as the Company accounts for these investments in\naccordance with the Investment Company Audit Guide (codified in\nASC 946); \u2022 certain investment funds for which the Company\nprovides investment management services and personal estate\ntrusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee\nand/or investment management services; \u2022 certain third-party\nsponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides\nsecured credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making\npower and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may\nmeet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related\ncommitment. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\nCompany\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these deals was $\n56.6billion and $ 57.0billion, respectively (for more\ninformation on these positions, see Note 13 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citigroup\u2019s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K); \u2022\ncertain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company\nholds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on\narm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and asset-\nbacked securities held by the Company, which are classified as\nTrading account assets or Investments , in which the Company has\nno other involvement with the related securitization entity\ndeemed to be significant (for more information on these\npositions, see Notes 12 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements); \u2022 certain representations and warranties exposures\nin legacy ICG -sponsored mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecuritizations in which the Company has no variable interest or\ncontinuing involvement as servicer. The outstanding balance of\nmortgage loans securitized during 2005 to 2008 in which the\nCompany has no variable interest or continuing involvement as\nservicer was approximately $ 4.7billion and $ 5.2billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively; \u2022\ncertain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection\nwith the Company\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have\na variable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings.

In managing this risk, Citigroup economically\nhedges a significant portion of the value of its MSRs through\nthe use of interest rate derivative contracts, forward purchase\nand sale commitments of mortgage-backed securities and purchased\nsecurities, all classified as Trading account assets .\n                              163                               \nThe Company receives fees\nduring the course of servicing\npreviously securitized\nmortgages.

Citi did\nnot transfer non-agency\n(private label) securities to\nre-securitization entities\nduring the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020.\nThese securities are backed by\neither residential or\ncommercial mortgages and are\noften structured on behalf of\nclients. As of September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020,\nCiti held noretained interests\nin private label re-\nsecuritization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The\nCompany also re-securitizes\nU.S. government-agency-\nguaranteed mortgage-backed\n(agency) securities. During\nthe three and nine months\nended September 30, 2021, Citi\ntransferred agency securities\nwith a fair value of\napproximately $ 12.6billion\nand $ 37.1billion,\nrespectively, to re-\nsecuritization entities\ncompared to approximately $\n11.5billion and $ 31.8billion\nfor the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2020,\nrespectively. As of September\n30, 2021, the fair value of\nCiti-retained interests in\nagency re-securitization\ntransactions structured by\nCiti totaled approximately $\n1.2billion (including $\n526million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2021) compared to\n$ 1.6billion as of December\n31, 2020 (including $\n916million related to re-\nsecuritization transactions\nexecuted in 2020), which is\nrecorded in Trading account\nassets . The original fair\nvalues of agency re-\nsecuritization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained\ninterest as of September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020\nwere approximately $ 78billion\nand $ 83.6billion,\nrespectively. As of September\n30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, the Company did not\nconsolidate any private label\nor agency re-securitization\nentities.\n\nCiti-Administered Asset-Backed\nCommercial Paper Conduits At\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the\ncommercial paper conduits\nadministered by Citi had\napproximately $ 12.5billion\nand $ 16.7billion of purchased\nassets outstanding,\nrespectively, and had\nincremental funding\ncommitments with clients of\napproximately $ 20.5billion\nand $ 17.1billion,\nrespectively. Substantially\nall of the funding of the\nconduits is in the form of\nshort-term commercial paper.\nAt September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the\nweighted average remaining\nlives of the commercial paper\nissued by the conduits were\napproximately 65and 54days,\nrespectively. The primary\ncredit enhancement provided to\nthe conduit investors is in\nthe form of transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements\ndescribed above. Each asset\npurchased by the conduit is\nstructured with transaction-\nspecific credit enhancement\nfeatures provided by the\nthird-party client seller,\nincluding over-\ncollateralization, cash and\nexcess spread collateral\naccounts, direct recourse or\nthird-party guarantees. These\ncredit enhancements are sized\nwith the objective of\napproximating a credit rating\nof A or above, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. In\naddition to the transaction-\nspecific credit enhancements,\nthe conduits, other than the\ngovernment-guaranteed loan\nconduit, have obtained letters\nof credit from the Company,\nwhich equal at least 8% to 10%\nof the conduit\u2019s assets with a\nminimum of $ 200million. The\nletters of credit provided by\nthe Company to the conduits\ntotal approximately $\n1.1billion and $ 1.5billion as\nof September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nrespectively. The net result\nacross multi-seller conduits\nadministered by the Company is\nthat, in the event that\ndefaulted assets exceed the\ntransaction-specific credit\nenhancements described above,\nany losses in each conduit are\nallocated first to the Company\nand then to the commercial\npaper investors. At September\n30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, the Company owned $\n2.5billion and $ 6.6billion,\nrespectively, of the\ncommercial paper issued by its\nadministered conduits. The\nCompany\u2019s investments were not\ndriven by market illiquidity\nand the Company is not\nobligated under any agreement\nto purchase the commercial\npaper issued by the conduits.\n                              164                               \nCollateralized Loan\nObligations (CLOs) There were\nno new securitizations during\nthe three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table summarizes\nselected retained interests\nrelated to Citigroup CLOs:\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                                \n  dollars                   Sept. 30, 2021       Dec. 31, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying value of      $           1,519    $          1,611  \n  retained interests                                            \n                                                                \nAll of Citi\u2019s retained interests were held-to-maturity\nsecurities as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\nMunicipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts At\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, none of the municipal\nbonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit\nguarantee provided by the Company. At September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, liquidity agreements provided with respect to\ncustomer TOB trusts totaled $ 1.5billion and $ 1.6billion,\nrespectively, of which $ 0.7billion and $ 0.8billion,\nrespectively, were offset by reimbursement agreements. For the\nremaining exposure related to TOB transactions, where the\nresidual owned by the customer was at least 25% of the bond\nvalue at the inception of the transaction, no reimbursement\nagreement was executed. The Company also provides other\nliquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored\nmunicipal investment funds, which are not variable interest\nentities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $\n2.2billion and $ 3.6billion as of September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 22 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nInformation pertaining to\nCitigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from market\nfluctuations (i.e., market\nrisk), counterparty failure\n(i.e., credit risk) and/or\nperiods of high volatility or\nfinancial stress (i.e.,\nliquidity risk), as well as\nany market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n                              166

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              167                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020. Gross\npositive fair values are\noffset against gross negative\nfair values by counterparty,\npursuant to enforceable master\nnetting agreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. As a\nresult, the tables reflect a\nreduction of approximately $\n290billion and $ 280billion as\nof September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nrespectively, of derivative\nassets and derivative\nliabilities that previously\nwould have been reported on a\ngross basis, but are now\nlegally settled and not\nsubject to collateral. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              168

For\nqualifying fair value hedges\nof interest rate risk, the\nchanges in the fair value of\nthe derivative and the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedged item attributable to\nthe hedged risk are presented\nwithin Interest revenue or\nInterest expense based on\nwhether the hedged item is an\nasset or a liability.\nCitigroup has executed a last-\nof-layer hedge, which permits\nan entity to hedge the\ninterest rate risk of a stated\nportion of a closed portfolio\nof prepayable financial assets\nthat are expected to remain\noutstanding for the designated\ntenor of the hedge. In\naccordance with ASC 815, an\nentity may exclude prepayment\nrisk when measuring the change\nin fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk under the last-of-\nlayer approach. Similar to\nother fair value hedges, where\nthe hedged item is an asset,\nthe fair value of the hedged\nitem attributable to interest\nrate risk will be presented in\nInterest revenue along with\nthe change in the fair value\nof the hedging instrument.\n\nHedging of Foreign Exchange\nRisk Citigroup hedges the\nchange in fair value\nattributable to foreign\nexchange rate movements in\navailable-for-sale debt\nsecurities and long-term debt\nthat are denominated in\ncurrencies other than the\nfunctional currency of the\nentity holding the securities\nor issuing the debt. The\nhedging instrument is\ngenerally a forward foreign\nexchange contract or a cross-\ncurrency swap contract.\nCitigroup considers the\npremium associated with\nforward contracts (i.e., the\ndifferential between the spot\nand contractual forward rates)\nas the cost of hedging; this\namount is excluded from the\nassessment of hedge\neffectiveness and is generally\nreflected directly in earnings\nover the life of the hedge.\nCiti also excludes changes in\ncross-currency basis\nassociated with cross-currency\nswaps from the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness and\nrecords it in Other\ncomprehensive income. Hedging\nof Commodity Price Risk\nCitigroup hedges the change in\nfair value attributable to\nspot price movements in\nphysical commodities\ninventories. The hedging\ninstrument is a futures\ncontract to sell the\nunderlying commodity. In this\nhedge, the change in the value\nof the hedged inventory is\nreflected in earnings, which\noffsets the change in the fair\nvalue of the futures contract\nthat is also reflected in\nearnings. Although the change\nin the fair value of the\nhedging instrument recorded in\nearnings includes changes in\nforward rates, Citigroup\nexcludes the differential\nbetween the spot and the\ncontractual forward rates\nunder the futures contract\nfrom the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, and it is\ngenerally reflected directly\nin earnings over the life of\nthe hedge. Citi also excludes\nchanges in forward rates from\nthe assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and records it\nin Other comprehensive income.\n                              171                               \nThe following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the\nCompany\u2019s fair value hedges:\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       3       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $  \u2014    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $      $      $      $    \n                                                                \n(1) Gain (loss) amounts for interest rate risk hedges are\nincluded in Interest income/Interest expense .

settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020 was $\n20billion and $ 25billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 18billion and $\n22billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of\nSeptember 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nrespectively. A downgrade\ncould trigger additional\ncollateral or cash settlement\nrequirements for the Company\nand certain affiliates. In the\nevent that Citigroup and\nCitibank were downgraded a\nsingle notch by all threemajor\nrating agencies as of\nSeptember 30, 2021, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n1.5billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 0.1billion upon the\nsingle notch downgrade,\nresulting in aggregate cash\nobligations and collateral\nrequirements of approximately\n$ 1.6billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nboth the asset amounts\nderecognized and the gross\ncash proceeds received as of\nthe date of derecognition were\n$ 1.6billion and $ 2.0billion\nas of September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020,\nrespectively. At September 30,\n2021, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 1.6billion. The fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps as of September 30, 2021\nwas $ 53million recorded as\ngross derivative assets and $\n18million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2020, the fair\nvalue of these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.2billion, and the fair value\nof the total return swaps was\n$ 135million recorded as gross\nderivative assets and $\n7million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              176                               \n20.

inputs\nbased on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are developed using market data and reflect\nmarket participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs\nreflect the Company\u2019s market assumptions. These two types of\ninputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: \u2022 Level\n1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. \u2022\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active and model-derived valuations in\nwhich all significant inputs and significant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022 Level 3: Valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or\nsignificant value drivers are unobservable . As required under\nthe fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and\nobservable market inputs in its valuations where possible. The\nfrequency of transactions, the size of the bid/ask spread and\nthe amount of adjustment necessary when comparing similar\ntransactions are all factors in determining the relevance of\nobserved prices in those markets.\n                              177                               \nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following\ntables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the\nCompany\u2019s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis at September 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020.

transfers for the period December 31, 2020\nto September 30, 2021: \u2022 During the nine months ended September\n30, 2021, transfers of Loans of $ 2.0billion from Level 3 to\nLevel 2 were primarily driven by equity forward and volatility\ninputs that have been assessed as not significant to the overall\nvaluation of certain hybrid loan instruments, including equity\noptions and long dated equity call spreads. \u2022 During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021, transfers of Equity contracts\nof $ 1.0billion from Level 2 to Level 3 were due to equity\nforward and volatility inputs becoming an unobservable and/or\nsignificant input relative to the overall valuation of equity\noptions and equity swaps. In other instances, market changes\nhave resulted in observable equity forward and volatility inputs\nbecoming an insignificant input to the overall valuation of the\ninstrument (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of\nthe money). This has resulted in $ 1.6billion of certain Equity\ncontracts being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2. \u2022 During\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, transfers of\nLong-term debt were $ 2.1billion and $ 6.9billion, respectively,\nfrom Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $ 6.9billion transfer in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2021, approximately $ 5.9billion\nrelated to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming\nunobservable and/or significant relative to their overall\nvaluation, and $ 0.9billion related to equity volatility inputs\n(in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate\nvolatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to\ntheir overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have\nresulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some\nunobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall\nvaluation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-\nin or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $\n1.1billion and $ 7.1billion of certain structured long-term debt\nproducts being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.\nThe following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the\nperiod December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020: \u2022 During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2020, transfers of Interest rate\ncontracts of $ 1.6billion from Level 2 to Level 3 were due to\ninterest rate option volatility becoming an unobservable and/or\nsignificant input relative to the overall valuation of inflation\nand other interest rate derivatives. \u2022 During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2020, $ 1.4billion and $ 6.5billion,\nrespectively, of Long-term debt containing embedded derivatives\nwas transferred from Level 2 to Level 3, as a result of interest\nrate option volatility, equity correlation and credit derivative\ninputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to the\noverall valuation of certain structured long-term debt products.\nIn other instances, market changes resulted in unobservable\nvolatility inputs becoming insignificant to the overall\nvaluation of the instrument (e.g., when an option becomes deep-\nin or deep-out of the money). This has resulted in $ 4.2billion\nof certain structured long-term debt products being transferred\nfrom Level 3 to Level 2 during the nine months ended September\n30, 2020.\n

Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . Among other\nvariables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair\nvalue option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and\nsimilar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of\nthe Company\u2019s credit spreads. The estimated changes in the fair\nvalue of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in\nthe Company\u2019s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit\nrisk) were a loss of $ 107million and a loss of $ 452million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and a loss\nof $ 256million and a gain of $ 801million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in fair\nvalue resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk\nwere estimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit\nspreads observable in the bond market into the relevant\nvaluation technique used to value each liability as described\nabove. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial\nLiabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain\nUncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the\nfair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income\nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nborrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-\nterm borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the\nelection was made because the related interest rate risk is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting\nderivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings. Changes in fair value for transactions in\nthese portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The\nrelated interest revenue and interest expense are measured based\non the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are\nreported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans and Other Credit\nProducts Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for\ncertain other originated and purchased loans, including certain\nunfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of\ncredit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses.\nNone of these credit products are highly leveraged financing\ncommitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans\nand unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold\nor securitized in the near term, or transactions where the\neconomic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as\npurchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the\nCompany pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third\nparty. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate\naccounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex\nand to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not\nelected for most lending transactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                Septem\u2026                                         \n                    30,                   December              \n                   2021                   31, 2020              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026       Trading       Loans        Trading       Loans  \n  of             assets                     assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $    8,382    $  7,159    $     8,063    $  6,854  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess           -116        -161           -915         -14  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans               \u2014           1              \u2014           4  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value               \u2014           1              \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              197                               \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 744million and $\n1,068million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nChanges in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products\nare classified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the nine months ended September 30,\n2021 and 2020 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to\nlosses of $( 10) million and $( 23) million, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals Citigroup\ninvests in unallocated precious metals accounts (gold, silver,\nplatinum and palladium) as part of its commodity and foreign\ncurrency trading activities or to economically hedge certain\nexposures from issuing structured liabilities. Under ASC 815,\nthe investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a\ncommodity forward derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the\nfair value option for the debt host contract, and reports the\ndebt host contract within Trading account assets on the\nCompany\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The total carrying amount\nof debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals\naccounts was approximately $ 0.4billion and $ 0.5billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The\namounts are expected to fluctuate based on trading activity in\nfuture periods. As part of its commodity and foreign currency\ntrading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals\ninvestments and executes forward purchase and forward sale\nderivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi\nsells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi\u2019s\nreceivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi\nderecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal.\nThe forward purchase or sale contract with the trading\ncounterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted\nfor as a derivative, at fair value through earnings. As of\nSeptember 30, 2021, there were approximately $ 16.7billion and $\n6.7billion of notional amounts of such forward purchase and\nforward sale derivative contracts outstanding, respectively.\nCertain Investments in Private Equity and Real Estate Ventures\nCitigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for\nthe purpose of earning investment returns and for capital\nappreciation. The Company has elected the fair value option for\ncertain of these ventures, because such investments are\nconsidered similar to many private equity or hedge fund\nactivities in Citi\u2019s investment companies, which are reported at\nfair value. The fair value option brings consistency in the\naccounting and evaluation of these investments. All investments\n(debt and equity) in such private equity and real estate\nentities are accounted for at fair value. These investments are\nclassified as Investments on Citigroup\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. Changes in the fair values of these investments are\nclassified in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)\nCitigroup has elected the fair value option for certain\npurchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming\nadjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are\nintended for sale or securitization and are hedged with\nderivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value\noption to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge\naccounting is complex and to achieve operational\nsimplifications.\nThe following table provides information about certain mortgage\nloans HFS carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n  In millions of         September 30,                          \n  dollars                         2021       December 31, 2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Carrying amount                                               \n  reported on the     $          2,630    $              1,742  \n  Consolidated                                                  \n  Balance Sheet                                                 \n  Aggregate fair                                                \n  value in excess                                               \n  of (less                          77                      91  \n  than) unpaid                                                  \n  principal                                                     \n  balance                                                       \n  Balance of                                                    \n  non-accrual                                                   \n  loans or loans                     1                       \u2014  \n  more than 90                                                  \n  days past due                                                 \n  Aggregate unpaid                                              \n  principal                                                     \n  balance in                                                    \n  excess of fair                                                \n  value for                          \u2014                       \u2014  \n  non-accrual                                                   \n  loans or loans                                                \n  more than 90                                                  \n  days past                                                     \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              198                               \nThe changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are\nreported in Other revenue in the Company\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income.

Related interest income\ncontinues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates\nand reported as Interest revenue in the Consolidated Statement\nof Income. Certain Debt Liabilities The Company has elected the\nfair value option for certain debt liabilities. The Company\nelected the fair value option because these exposures are\nconsidered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, they\nare managed on a fair value basis.

For certain\ncontracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum\npotential future payments is\nbased on the notional\n\namount of the guarantees\nwithout consideration of\npossible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As\nsuch, Citi believes such\namounts bear no relationship\nto the anticipated losses, if\nany, on these guarantees.

lending indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be $ 115billion and $\n102billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the\nmaximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure based on its historical experience. This\ncontingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and\nservices are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded\nwhen items are returned to merchants.\n                              200                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts shown\nin the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase reserve for\nits potential repurchases or make-whole liability regarding\nresidential mortgage representation and warranty claims related\nto its whole loan sales to U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nand, to a lesser extent, private investors. The repurchase\nreserve was approximately $ 32million and $ 31million at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and\nthese amounts are included in Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Card Arrangements with\nPartners Citi, in one of its credit card partner arrangements,\nprovides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of\ncertain customer originations during the term of the agreement.\nTo the extent that such origination targets are not met, the\nguarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments\nthat otherwise would have been generated in connection with such\noriginations. Other Guarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card\nProtection Programs Citi, through its credit card businesses,\nprovides various cardholder protection programs on several of\nits card products, including programs that provide insurance\ncoverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated\nwith purchased products, price protection for certain purchases\nand protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not\nincluded in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the\nguarantees and Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be\nquantified. The protection is limited to certain types of\npurchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the\npurchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given\ntime. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential\nliability related to these programs based on the extent and\nnature of its historical loss experience. At September 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, the actual and estimated losses incurred\nand the carrying value of Citi\u2019s obligations related to these\nprograms were immaterial. Value-Transfer Networks (Including\nExchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or\nshareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs)\n(payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges)\naround the world. As a condition of membership, many of these\nVTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of\nthe losses incurred by the organization due to another member\u2019s\ndefault on its obligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be\nlimited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions\nto the VTN\u2019s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro\nrata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as\nthis would require an assessment of claims that have not yet\noccurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote\ngiven historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care Insurance Indemnification\nIn 2000, Travelers Life & Annuity (Travelers), then a subsidiary\nof Citi, entered into a reinsurance agreement to transfer the\nrisks and rewards of its long-term care (LTC) business to GE\nLife (now Genworth Financial Inc., or Genworth), then a\nsubsidiary of the General Electric Company (GE). As part of this\ntransaction, the reinsurance obligations were provided by two\nregulated insurance subsidiaries of GE Life, which funded two\ncollateral trusts with securities. Presently, as discussed\nbelow, the trusts are referred to as the Genworth Trusts. As\npart of GE\u2019s spin-off of Genworth in 2004, GE retained the risks\nand rewards associated with the 2000 Travelers reinsurance\nagreement by providing a reinsurance contract to Genworth\nthrough GE\u2019s Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC)\nsubsidiary that covers the Travelers LTC policies. In addition,\nGE provided a capital maintenance agreement in favor of UFLIC\nthat is designed to assure that UFLIC will have the funds to pay\nits reinsurance obligations. As a result of these reinsurance\nagreements and the spin-off of Genworth, Genworth has\nreinsurance protection from UFLIC (supported by GE) and has\nreinsurance obligations in connection with the Travelers LTC\npolicies. As noted below, the Genworth reinsurance obligations\nnow benefit Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (Brighthouse). While\nneither Brighthouse nor Citi are direct beneficiaries of the\ncapital maintenance agreement between GE and UFLIC, Brighthouse\nand Citi benefit indirectly from the existence of the capital\nmaintenance agreement, which helps assure that UFLIC will\ncontinue to have funds necessary to pay its reinsurance\nobligations to Genworth. In connection with Citi\u2019s 2005 sale of\nTravelers to MetLife Inc. (MetLife), Citi provided an\nindemnification to MetLife for losses (including policyholder\nclaims) relating to the LTC business for the entire term of the\nTravelers LTC policies, which, as noted above, are reinsured by\nsubsidiaries of Genworth. In 2017, MetLife spun off its retail\ninsurance business to Brighthouse. As a result, the Travelers\nLTC policies now reside with Brighthouse. The original\nreinsurance agreement between Travelers (now Brighthouse) and\nGenworth remains in place and Brighthouse is the sole\nbeneficiary of the Genworth Trusts. The Genworth Trusts are\ndesigned to provide collateral to Brighthouse in an amount equal\nto the statutory liabilities of Brighthouse in respect of the\nTravelers LTC policies. The assets in the Genworth Trusts are\nevaluated and adjusted periodically to ensure that the fair\nvalue of the assets continues to provide collateral in an amount\nequal to these estimated statutory liabilities, as the\nliabilities change over time.\n                              201                               \nIf both (i) Genworth fails to perform under the original\nTravelers/GE Life reinsurance agreement for any reason,\nincluding its insolvency or the failure of UFLIC to perform\nunder its reinsurance contract or GE to perform under the\ncapital maintenance agreement, and (ii) the assets of the\ntwoGenworth Trusts are insufficient or unavailable, then Citi,\nthrough its LTC reinsurance indemnification, must reimburse\nBrighthouse for any losses incurred in connection with the LTC\npolicies. Since both events would have to occur before Citi\nwould become responsible for any payment to Brighthouse pursuant\nto its indemnification obligation, and the likelihood of such\nevents occurring is currently not probable, there is noliability\nreflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020 related to this indemnification.\nHowever, if both events become reasonably possible (meaning more\nthan remote but less than probable), Citi will be required to\nestimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range of\nloss to the extent that such an estimate could be made. In\naddition, if both events become probable, Citi will be required\nto accrue for such liability in accordance with applicable\naccounting principles. Citi continues to closely monitor its\npotential exposure under this indemnification obligation, given\nGE\u2019s 2018 LTC and other charges and the September 2019 AM Best\ncredit ratings downgrade for the Genworth subsidiaries. Futures\nand Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing\nservices on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need\nto clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative\ncontracts with CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and\ncircumstances, Citi has concluded that it acts as an agent for\naccounting purposes in its role as clearing member for these\nclient transactions. As such, Citi does not reflect the\nunderlying exchange-traded or OTC derivatives contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. See Note 19 for a discussion\nof Citi\u2019s derivatives activities that are reflected in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. As a clearing member, Citi\ncollects and remits cash and securities collateral (margin)\nbetween its clients and the respective CCP. In certain\ncircumstances, Citi collects a higher amount of cash (or\nsecurities) from its clients than it needs to remit to the CCPs.\nThis excess cash is then held at depository institutions such as\nbanks or carry brokers. There are two types of margin: initial\nand variation. Where Citi obtains benefits from or controls cash\ninitial margin (e.g., retains an interest spread), cash initial\nmargin collected from clients and remitted to the CCP or\ndepository institutions is reflected within Brokerage payables\n(payables to customers) and Brokerage receivables (receivables\nfrom brokers, dealers and clearing organizations) or Cash and\ndue from banks , respectively. However, for exchange-traded and\nOTC-cleared derivative contracts where Citi does not obtain\nbenefits from or control the client cash balances, the client\ncash initial margin collected from clients and remitted to the\nCCP or depository institutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. These conditions are met when Citi\nhas contractually agreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 17.1billion and $ 16.6billion as of September\n30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Variation margin\ndue from clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to\nclients, reflects changes in the value of the client\u2019s\nderivative contracts for each trading day. As a clearing member,\nCiti is exposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g.,\nfailure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for\nnegative changes in the value of the client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi\nwould move to close out the client\u2019s positions. The CCP would\ntypically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held\nby the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by\nCiti as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash\nor securities margin posted by the client, which would typically\nbe expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in\nthe event the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At September 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.4billion and $\n2.2billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 62.8billion and $\n51.6billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 88.1billion and $ 80.1billion at\nSeptember 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The\nmajority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized\nunder securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters\nof credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $\n3.9billion and $ 6.6billion at September 30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively. Other property may also be available to\nCiti to cover losses under certain guarantees and\nindemnifications; however, the value of such property has not\nbeen determined.\n                              202                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n  In

Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At September 30,\n2021, Citigroup estimates that\nthe reasonably possible\nunaccrued loss for these\nmatters ranges up to\napproximately $ 1.5billion in\nthe aggregate. As available\ninformation changes, the\nmatters for which Citigroup is\nable to estimate will change,\nand the estimates themselves\nwill change. In addition,\nwhile many estimates presented\nin financial statements and\nother financial disclosures\ninvolve significant judgment\nand may be subject to\nsignificant uncertainty,\nestimates of the range of\nreasonably possible loss\narising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued in\nrelation to matters for which\nan estimate has been made\ncould be substantially higher\nor lower than the range of\nloss included in the estimate.\n\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all matters\ndescribed in this Note would\nnot be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters\ncould, from time to time, have\na material adverse effect on\nCitigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash\nflows in particular quarterly\nor annual periods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 27 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2020\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nANZ Underwriting Matter In\nAugust 2021, the Australian\nCommonwealth Director of\nPublic Prosecution (CDPP)\ndiscontinued four of the six\ncharges brought against\nCitigroup Global Markets\nAustralia Pty Limited.
