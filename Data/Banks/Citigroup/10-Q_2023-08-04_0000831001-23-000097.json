from\nDiversified Business Model and\nStrong Balance Sheet\n\nAs described further\nthroughout this Executive\nSummary, during the second\nquarter of 2023:\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s revenues decreased 1%\nversus the prior-year period,\nboth on a reported basis and\nexcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts (see \u201c Legacy\nFranchises \u201d below). The\ndecrease in revenues was\nprimarily driven by lower non-\ninterest revenues, mainly\noffset by higher net interest\nincome.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s expenses increased 9%\nversus the prior-year period,\nboth on a reported basis and\nexcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts (see \u201c Legacy\nFranchises \u201d below), largely\ndriven by continued\ninvestments in risk and\ncontrols, business-led and\nenterprise-led investments,\nvolume growth and\nmacroeconomic factors,\nincluding inflation, as well\nas severance costs. The\nexpense increase was partially\noffset by productivity savings\nand an expense reduction from\nthe exited markets and\ncontinued wind-downs (see\n\u201cExpenses\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s cost of credit was\n$1.8 billion versus $1.3\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. The increase was\nprimarily driven by higher net\ncredit losses, reflecting the\ncontinued normalization in net\ncredit losses in Branded cards\nand Retail services.\n\n\u2022 Citi returned $2.0 billion\nto common shareholders in the\nform of dividends and share\nrepurchases. As previously\ndisclosed, in July 2023 Citi\u2019s\nBoard of Directors declared a\nquarterly common stock\ndividend of $0.53 per share\nfor the third quarter of 2023,\nup from $0.51 in the previous\nquarter. Citi intends to\nmaintain a quarterly common\ndividend of at least $0.53 per\nshare, subject to financial\nand macroeconomic conditions,\nas well as Board of Directors\napproval.\n\n\u2022 Citi\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1\n(CET1) Capital ratio under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach increased to 13.4% as\nof June 30, 2023, compared to\n12.0% as of June 30, 2022 (see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below).\nThis compares to Citi\u2019s\nrequired regulatory CET1\nCapital ratio of 12.0% as of\nJanuary 1, 2023 under the\nBasel III Standardized\nApproach. As previously\ndisclosed, on October 1, 2023,\nCiti\u2019s required regulatory\nCET1 Capital ratio will\nincrease to 12.3% from 12.0%\nunder the Standardized\nApproach reflecting the\nincrease in the Stress Capital\nBuffer (SCB) requirement to\n4.3% from 4.0% (see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Stress Capital\nBuffer\u201d below).\n\n\u2022 In May 2023, Citi announced\nthat it intends to pursue an\ninitial public offering (IPO)\nof its consumer, small\nbusiness and middle-market\nbanking operations in Mexico,\nfollowing the planned\nseparation from Citi\u2019s\nInstitutional Clients Group\n(ICG) and Private bank\nbusinesses in Mexico, both of\nwhich will remain part of\nCiti.\n\n\u2022 Citi continued to make\nprogress on its other consumer\nbanking business divestitures\nin the second quarter of 2023,\nincluding working toward the\nclosing of its Taiwan and\nIndonesia sale transactions in\nthe second half of 2023, as\nwell as progressing with the\ncontinued wind-downs of the\nKorea and China consumer\nbanking businesses and the\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbusinesses. In addition, Citi\nintends to restart the exit\nprocess for the consumer\nbanking business in Poland\nlater in 2023, subject to\nmarket conditions.\n                                                                \n  Second Quarter of 2023 Results Summary                        \n                                                                \n                                                                \n  Citigroup                                                     \n                                                                \nCitigroup reported net income\nof $2.9 billion, or $1.33 per\nshare, compared to net income\nof $4.5 billion, or $2.19 per\nshare in the prior-year\nperiod. The decrease in net\nincome was primarily driven by\nthe higher expenses and the\nhigher cost of credit, as well\nas the lower revenues.\nCitigroup\u2019s effective tax rate\nwas approximately 27% in the\ncurrent quarter versus 20% in\nthe prior-year period, largely\ndriven by the geographic mix\nof earnings (see \u201cIncome\nTaxes\u201d below). Earnings per\nshare (EPS) decreased 39% from\nthe prior-year period,\nreflecting the lower net\nincome and an approximate 1%\nincrease in average diluted\nshares outstanding.\n\nResults for the second quarter\nof 2023 included divestiture-\nrelated impacts of $(73)\nmillion in earnings before\ntaxes ($(92) million after-\ntax). See \u201c Legacy Franchises\n\u201d and \u201c Corporate/Other \u201d\nbelow for details about the\ndivestiture-related impacts.\n\nThese divestiture-related\nimpacts, collectively, had a\n$(0.04) negative impact on EPS\nin the current quarter.\nExcluding these divestiture-\nrelated impacts, EPS was\n$1.37. (As used throughout\nthis Form 10-Q, Citi\u2019s results\nof operations and financial\ncondition excluding the impact\nof divestiture-related impacts\nare non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.)\n\nResults for the second quarter\nof 2022 included divestiture-\nrelated impacts of $48 million\nin earnings before taxes ($35\nmillion after-tax). See \u201c\nLegacy Franchises \u201d below for\ndetails about the divestiture-\nrelated impacts.\n\nThese divestiture-related\nimpacts, collectively, had a\n$0.02 beneficial impact on EPS\nin the prior-year period.\nExcluding these divestiture-\nrelated impacts, EPS was\n$2.17.\n\nCitigroup revenues of $19.4\nbillion in the second quarter\nof 2023 decreased 1% from the\nprior-year period, both on a\nreported basis and excluding\ndivestiture-related impacts.\nThe lower revenues reflected a\ndecline in revenues across\nMarkets and Investment banking\nin ICG and Global Wealth\nManagement (Global Wealth) in\nPersonal Banking and Wealth\nManagement (PBWM) , as well as\na revenue reduction from the\nexited markets and continued\nwind-downs in Legacy\nFranchises. The decline in\nrevenues was largely offset by\nstrength across Services in\nICG , U.S. Personal Banking\nrevenues in PBWM and higher\nrevenues from the investment\nportfolio in Corporate/Other .\n                               3                                \nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\nloans were $661 billion, up 1%\nversus the prior-year period,\ndriven by growth in PBWM ,\nprimarily driven by U.S.\nPersonal Banking, largely\noffset by declines in ICG and\nLegacy Franchises .\n\nCitigroup\u2019s end-of-period\ndeposits were approximately\n$1.3 trillion, largely\nunchanged versus the prior-\nyear period, as a decrease in\nICG , primarily driven by\nSecurities services, was\noffset by an increase in\ninstitutional certificates of\ndeposit in Corporate/Other.\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s deposits by\nbusiness, including drivers\nand deposit trends, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cLiquidity\nRisk\u2014Deposits\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Expenses                                                      \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s operating expenses\nof $13.6 billion increased 9%\nfrom the prior-year period,\nboth on a reported basis and\nexcluding divestiture-related\nimpacts. The higher expenses\nlargely reflected continued\ninvestments in risk and\ncontrols, business-led and\nenterprise-led investments,\nvolume growth and\nmacroeconomic factors,\nincluding inflation, as well\nas severance costs. The higher\nexpenses were partially offset\nby productivity savings and\nexpense reductions from the\nexited markets and wind-downs\nin Legacy Franchises.\n\nAs previously disclosed, Citi\nexpects a sequential increase\nin expenses for the third\nquarter of 2023, primarily\nreflecting continued\ninvestments in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation and other risk\nand controls.\n                                                                \n  Cost of Credit                                                \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s total provisions for\ncredit losses and for benefits\nand claims was a cost of $1.8\nbillion, compared to $1.3\nbillion in the prior-year\nperiod. This increase was\ndriven by higher net credit\nlosses (see below), partially\noffset by a lower net build of\n$320 million in the ACL for\nloans and unfunded commitments\nand other provisions. The net\nACL build and other provisions\nin the current quarter were\nprimarily driven by growth in\ncard balances in Branded cards\nand Retail services. This\ncompared to a net ACL build\nand other provisions of $424\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod. For additional\ninformation on Citi\u2019s ACL, see\n\u201cSignificant Accounting\nPolicies and Significant\nEstimates\u2014Citi\u2019s Allowance for\nCredit Losses (ACL)\u201d below.\n\nNet credit losses of $1.5\nbillion increased 77% from the\nprior year. Consumer net\ncredit losses of $1.4 billion\nincreased 73%, reflecting\nongoing normalization,\nparticularly in Branded cards\nand Retail services. Corporate\nnet credit losses increased to\n$75 million from $23 million.\n\nCiti also expects to incur\nhigher year-over-year net\ncredit losses for the third\nquarter of 2023, primarily\ndriven by continued\nnormalization, particularly in\nthe cards business in PBWM .\n\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s consumer and corporate\ncredit costs, see each\nrespective business\u2019s results\nof operations and \u201cCredit\nRisk\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Capital                                                       \n                                                                \nCitigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio\nwas 13.4% as of June 30, 2023,\ncompared to 12.0% as of June\n30, 2022, based on the Basel\nIII Standardized Approach for\ndetermining risk-weighted\nassets (RWA). The increase was\nprimarily driven by\n\nnet income, the impacts from\nthe closing of the Asia\nconsumer banking business\nsales and business actions,\nincluding a reduction in RWA,\npartially offset by the\npayment of common dividends\nand share repurchases.\n\nAs previously announced,\nduring the second quarter of\n2023, Citi resumed common\nshare repurchases, and\nrepurchased $1.0 billion of\ncommon shares (see\n\u201cUnregistered Sales of Equity\nSecurities, Repurchases of\nEquity Securities and\nDividends\u201d below). Citi will\ncontinue to assess common\nshare repurchases on a\nquarter-by-quarter basis given\nuncertainty regarding\nregulatory capital\nrequirements. For additional\ninformation, see \u201cCapital\nResources\u2014Regulatory Capital\nStandards and Developments\u201d\nbelow.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Supplementary\nLeverage ratio as of June 30,\n2023 was 6.0%, compared to\n5.7% as of June 30, 2022. The\nincrease was driven by higher\nTier 1 Capital, partially\noffset by an increase in Total\nLeverage Exposure. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s capital ratios and\nrelated components, see\n\u201cCapital Resources\u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Institutional Clients Group                                   \n                                                                \nICG net income of $2.2 billion\ndecreased 45%, primarily\ndriven by lower revenues,\nhigher expenses and higher\ncost of credit. ICG operating\nexpenses of $7.3 billion\nincreased 13%, primarily\ndriven by continued\ninvestments in Treasury and\ntrade solutions (TTS),\ncontinued risk and controls\ninvestments and severance\ncosts in Markets and\nInvestment banking, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nICG revenues of $10.4 billion\ndecreased 9% (including gain\n(loss) on loan hedges),\nprimarily driven by a decline\nin Markets and Banking,\npartially offset by growth in\nServices. Results included a\nloss on loan hedges of $66\nmillion in the second quarter\nof 2023, compared with a gain\non loan hedges of $494 million\nin the prior-year period.\n\nServices revenues of $4.7\nbillion increased 15%. TTS\nrevenues of $3.5 billion\nincreased 15%, driven by 18%\ngrowth in net interest income\nand 8% growth in non-interest\nrevenue. Strong performance in\nTTS was primarily driven by\nhigher interest rates and non-\ninterest revenue benefits from\ncontinued growth of underlying\ndrivers, primarily an 11%\nincrease in cross-border\ntransaction value and a 15%\nincrease in commercial card\nspend volume. Securities\nservices revenues of $1.1\nbillion increased 15%, as net\ninterest income increased 62%,\nlargely driven by higher\ninterest rates across\ncurrencies.\n\nMarkets revenues of $4.6\nbillion decreased 13%, driven\nby lower revenues in both\nFixed income markets and\nEquity markets relative to\nstrong performance in the\nprior-year period, as well as\nlow volatility in the second\nquarter of 2023. Fixed income\nmarkets revenues of $3.5\nbillion decreased 13%, driven\nby declines in currencies and\ncommodities, partially offset\nby modest growth in rates.\nEquity markets revenues of\n$1.1 billion decreased 10%,\nprimarily reflecting a decline\nin equity derivatives\nrevenues.\n\nBanking revenues of $1.2\nbillion decreased 44%,\nincluding the gain (loss) on\nloan hedges in the current\nquarter and the prior-year\nperiod. Excluding the gain\n(loss) on loan hedges, Banking\nrevenues of $1.2 billion\ndecreased 22%, driven by lower\nrevenues in Investment banking\nand Corporate lending.\nInvestment banking revenues of\n$612 million decreased 24%,\nreflecting a decline in the\noverall\n                               4                                \nmarket wallet, as continued\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical\nuncertainty continued to\nadversely impact client\nactivity. Corporate lending\nrevenues decreased 56%,\nincluding the impact of the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges.\nExcluding the impact of the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges,\nCorporate lending revenues\ndecreased 20% versus the\nprior-year period, primarily\ndriven by the impacts of\nforeign currency translation\nand lower lending volumes.

Branded cards\nrevenues of $2.4 billion\nincreased 8%, primarily driven\nby the higher net interest\nincome, as average loans\nincreased 14%. Retail services\nrevenues of $1.6 billion\nincreased 27%, primarily\ndriven by the higher net\ninterest income, as well as\nlower partner payments. Retail\nbanking revenues of $594\nmillion decreased 9%,\nprimarily reflecting the\ntransfer of certain\nrelationships and the\nassociated deposit balances to\nGlobal Wealth.\n\nGlobal Wealth revenues of $1.8\nbillion decreased 5%, largely\ndriven by continued investment\nproduct revenue headwinds and\nhigher interest rates paid on\ndeposits, partially offset by\nthe benefits from the\ncontinued transfer of Retail\nbanking relationships.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nPBWM for the second quarter of\n2023, see \u201c Personal Banking\nand Wealth Management \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Legacy Franchises                                             \n                                                                \nLegacy Franchises recorded a\nnet loss of $125 million,\ncompared to a net loss of $17\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, primarily driven by\nhigher cost of credit,\npartially offset by lower\nexpenses. Legacy Franchises\nexpenses of $1.8 billion\ndecreased 2%, primarily driven\nby the impact of exited\nmarkets and continued wind-\ndowns.\n\nLegacy Franchises revenues of\n$1.9 billion decreased 1%,\ndriven by the reductions from\nexited markets and continued\nwind-downs, partially offset\nby the benefit of higher rates\nand lending volumes in Mexico\nConsumer/SBMM, as well as\nhigher revenues in Legacy\nHoldings Assets.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nLegacy Franchises for the\nsecond quarter of 2023, see \u201c\nLegacy Franchises \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Corporate/Other                                               \n                                                                \nCorporate/Other net income was\n$356 million, compared to $50\nmillion in the prior-year\nperiod, largely driven by\nhigher net interest income\nfrom Deposits with banks and\nthe investment portfolio, a\nreserve release related to the\nrepayment of the previously\ndisclosed First Republic Bank\ndeposit and the prior-year\nrelease of a CTA loss (net of\nhedges) from AOCI (for\nadditional information, see\nNote 2). The increase in net\nincome was partially offset by\nlower income tax benefits and\nhigher expenses.\nCorporate/Other operating\nexpenses of $302 million\nincreased from $160 million in\nthe prior-year period,\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof inflation and severance\ncosts and the absence of\ncertain settlements that\noccurred in the prior-year\nperiod, partially offset by\nlower consulting expenses.\n\nCorporate/Other revenues of\n$677 million increased from\n$255 million in the prior-year\nperiod, primarily driven by\nhigher net interest income\nfrom Deposits with banks and\nthe investment portfolio,\nlargely due to higher interest\nrates.\n\nFor additional information on\nthe results of operations of\nCorporate/Other for the second\nquarter of 2023, see \u201c\nCorporate/Other \u201d below.\n                                                                \n  Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties               \n                                                                \nVarious geopolitical,\nmacroeconomic and regulatory\nchallenges and uncertainties\ncontinue to adversely impact\neconomic conditions in the\nU.S. and globally, including\ncentral banks continuing to\nincrease interest rates,\ncontinued elevated levels of\ninflation and economic and\ngeopolitical challenges\nrelated to both China and the\nRussia\u2013Ukraine war. These and\nother factors have adversely\naffected financial markets,\nnegatively impacted global\neconomic growth rates and\nraised fears of recession in\nthe U.S., Europe and other\nregions and countries. In\naddition, these and other\nfactors could adversely affect\nCiti\u2019s customers, clients,\nbusinesses, funding costs,\nexpenses and overall results\nof operations and financial\ncondition during the remainder\nof 2023.\n\nIn May 2023, the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC) issued a proposal that\nwould implement a special\nassessment to recover its\nuninsured deposit losses from\nrecent bank failures. The FDIC\nestimated that the preliminary\ncost of the failures is\napproximately $15.8 billion,\nan estimate that would be\nperiodically adjusted. If\nfinalized as proposed, the\nFDIC is proposing to collect\nthe special assessment at an\nannual rate of approximately\n12.5 basis points of uninsured\ndeposits, over eight quarterly\nassessment periods beginning\nin 2024. Citi is likely to\nincur a significant increase\nin its operating expenses if\nthe final rule for the FDIC\nspecial assessment is enacted\nas proposed, which is expected\nbefore the end of 2023. For\nadditional information on the\nexpected impact, see Note 26.\n\nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking\nagencies issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking, known as\nthe Basel III Endgame, related\nto regulatory capital\nrequirements. The rule as\nproposed would have a material\nimpact on Citi\u2019s current\ncapital position; however, its\nfinalization and\nimplementation will be a\n                               5                                \nmultiyear process, including\nphase-in periods to meet the\nnew capital requirements. Citi\nplans to comment on the\nproposal and adapt business\nactivities to address\nassociated impacts, if\nnecessary, and will be in\ncompliance with the final\nrule, once it is in effect and\nimplemented.

income may be\nrisk managed with derivatives that are recorded in Principal\ntransactions revenue within Non-interest revenue . For a\ndescription of the composition of these revenue line items, see\nNotes 4, 5 and 6.\n\n(2) Credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion\nof the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans\nand loans at fair value. Gain (loss) on loan hedges include the\nmark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market\non the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value.

Citigroup\u2019s\nresults of operations excluding the impact of gain (loss) on\nloan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nNM Not meaningful\n\nThe discussion of the results of operations for ICG below\nexcludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges\nof accrual loans, which are non-GAAP financial measures.

Banking\nrevenues were down 44%\n(including the impact of the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges),\nreflecting lower revenues in\nboth Investment banking and\nCorporate lending. Markets\nrevenues were down 13%, driven\nby lower revenues in both\nFixed income markets and\nEquity markets, due to lower\nclient activity, driven by\ndecreased volatility and a\nstrong prior-year comparison.\nServices revenues were up 15%,\ndriven by higher revenues in\nboth TTS and Securities\nservices.\n\nCiti expects that revenues in\nits Markets and Investment\nbanking businesses will\ncontinue to reflect the\noverall market environment\nduring the remainder of 2023.\n\nWithin Services:\n\n\u2022 TTS revenues increased 15%,\ndriven by 18% growth in net\ninterest income and 8% growth\nin non-interest revenue,\nreflecting strong growth\nacross all client segments.\nThe increase in net interest\nincome was primarily driven by\nhigher interest rates as well\nas growth in deposits,\npartially offset by higher\ninterest rates paid on\ndeposits. Average deposits\nincreased 2%, largely driven\nby growth in EMEA and Latin\nAmerica. Average loans\ndecreased 6%, reflecting\nbusiness actions taken to\nreduce RWA. The increase in\nnon-interest revenue was\nprimarily driven by strong fee\ngrowth in the cash business,\nreflecting solid client\nengagement and continued\ngrowth of underlying drivers,\nreflecting higher cross-border\nflows (up 11%) and commercial\ncard spend (up 15%).\n\n\u2022 Securities services revenues\nincreased 15%, as net interest\nincome grew 63%, driven by\nhigher interest rates across\ncurrencies and cost of funds\nmanagement, partially offset\nby the impact of an 8% decline\nin average deposits. Non-\ninterest revenues decreased\n5%, primarily driven by\ncustody fee spread\ncompression, partially offset\nby higher assets under custody\nand administration and\ncontinued elevated levels of\ncorporate activity in Issuer\nservices.\n\nWithin Markets:\n\n\u2022 Fixed income markets\nrevenues decreased 13%, driven\nby North America, EMEA and\nAsia, largely due to decreased\ninstitutional and corporate\nclient activity.\n\nRates and currencies decreased\n12%, largely due to a decline\nin the currencies business,\ndriven by EMEA, primarily\nreflecting lower volatility\nand a strong prior-year\ncomparison, partially offset\nby a modest increase in the\nrates business. Spread\nproducts and other fixed\nincome revenues decreased 17%,\ndue to a decline across\n\nregions in commodities, driven\nby lower corporate and\ninstitutional client activity,\nas well as a decline in the\nfinancing and securitization\nbusiness, as the business\nfurther reduced its\nsubscription credit facilities\nportfolio.\n\n\u2022 Equity markets revenues\ndecreased 10%, driven by North\nAmerica and Asia. The decline\nprimarily reflected lower\nequity derivatives revenues,\ndriven by a more challenging\nmacroeconomic environment,\nlower volatility and a strong\nprior-year comparison. The\ndecline in equity derivatives\nrevenues was partially offset\nby an increase in equity cash,\nreflecting a modest increase\nin institutional client\nactivity. Prime finance\nrevenues were largely\nunchanged, while prime finance\nbalances continued to grow in\nthe quarter.\n\nWithin Banking:\n\n\u2022 Investment banking revenues\ndeclined 24%, reflecting a\ndecline in the overall market\nwallet, as ongoing\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical\nuncertainty continued to\nadversely impact client\nactivity. Advisory revenues\ndecreased 55%, reflecting a\ndecline in North America and\nAsia, partially offset by\ngrowth in EMEA. The decrease\nin advisory revenues was\ndriven by the lower market\nwallet as well as lower wallet\nshare. Equity underwriting\nrevenues decreased 8%,\nreflecting a decline in North\nAmerica, Asia and EMEA, driven\nby lower wallet share,\npartially offset by growth in\nthe market wallet. Debt\nunderwriting revenues\nincreased 6%, reflecting\ngrowth in North America and\nEMEA, driven by wallet share\ngains, largely in the\ninvestment-grade portfolio,\npartially offset by the\ndecline in the market wallet.\n\n\u2022 Corporate lending revenues\ndecreased 56%, including the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges. Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, revenues\ndecreased 20%, primarily\ndriven by the impacts of\nforeign currency translation\nand lower lending volumes.\n\nExpenses increased 13%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in TTS, risk and\ncontrols investments and\nseverance costs in Markets and\nInvestment banking, partially\noffset by productivity\nsavings.\n\nProvisions reflected a cost of\n$58 million, compared to a\nbenefit of $202 million in the\nprior-year period, largely\ndriven by an ACL build for\nother assets and higher net\ncredit losses. Net credit\nlosses were $73 million,\ncompared to $18 million in the\nprior-year period.\n\nThe ACL release was $15\nmillion, compared to a release\nof $220 million in the prior-\nyear period. The $15 million\nACL release was driven by a\nnet ACL release for loans and\nunfunded lending commitments\nof $238 million, primarily due\nto an improved macroeconomic\noutlook, partially offset by a\n$223 million build for other\nassets, primarily related to\nan increase in transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the\n                               14                               \nU.S. driven by safety and\nsoundness considerations under\nU.S. banking law.

Banking\nrevenues were down 41%\n(including the impact of the\ngain (loss) on loan hedges),\nreflecting lower revenues in\nboth Investment banking and\nCorporate lending.

Excluding the\nimpact of gains (losses) on\nloan hedges, revenues\ndecreased 17%, driven by the\nsame factors described above.\n\nExpenses increased 8%,\nprimarily driven by continued\ninvestment in Citi\u2019s\ntransformation, investments in\nTTS, other risk and controls\ninvestments, volume-related\nexpenses and other structural\nexpenses, including severance\ncosts, partially offset by\nproductivity savings and\nforeign exchange translation.\n\nProvisions reflected a benefit\nof $14 million, compared to a\ncost of $769 million in the\nprior-year period, largely\ndriven by a net ACL release\nfor loans and unfunded lending\ncommitments, compared to an\nACL build in the prior-year\nperiod.

growth across U.S.\nPersonal Banking. The increase\nwas partially offset by lower\nnon-interest revenue,\nprimarily reflecting lower\ninvestment product revenues in\nGlobal Wealth.\n\nU.S. Personal Banking revenues\nincreased 11%, reflecting\nhigher revenues in cards,\npartially offset by lower\nrevenues in Retail banking.\n\nCards revenues increased 15%.\nBranded cards revenues\nincreased 8%, primarily driven\nby higher net interest income,\nreflecting strength in\nunderlying drivers.

Asia Consumer provides traditional retail\nbanking and branded card products to retail and small business\ncustomers. Mexico Consumer/SBMM provides traditional retail\nbanking and branded card products to consumers and small\nbusiness customers and traditional middle-market banking\nproducts and services to commercial customers through\nCitibanamex.\n\nLegacy Franchises also included the following seven consumer\nbanking businesses prior to their sale: Australia, until its\nclosing on June 1, 2022; the Philippines, until its closing on\nAugust 1, 2022; Thailand and Malaysia, until their closings on\nNovember 1, 2022; Bahrain, until its closing on December 1,\n2022; and India and Vietnam, until their closings on March 1,\n2023.\n\nIn addition, Citi has entered into agreements to sell its\nconsumer banking businesses in Indonesia and Taiwan, and has\ncontinued to make progress on its wind-downs of consumer banking\noperations in Korea and China and consumer banking and local\ncommercial banking operations in Russia (see below). See Note 2\nfor additional information on Legacy Franchises \u2019 consumer\nbanking business sales and wind-downs.\n\nIn May 2023, Citi announced it intends to pursue an IPO of\nconsumer, small business and middle-market banking operations in\nMexico. Citi will retain its ICG and Private bank businesses in\nMexico. Citi currently expects that the separation of the\nbusinesses will be completed in the second half of 2024 and that\nthe IPO will take place in 2025.\n\nIn connection with Citi\u2019s wind-down of its consumer and local\ncommercial banking businesses in Russia, Citi expects to incur\napproximately $140 million in total estimated charges (excluding\nthe impact from any portfolio sales) related to Legacy\nFranchises . Citi\u2019s previously disclosed referral agreement with\na Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-denominated credit\ncard loans, subject to customer consents, was signed in May\n2023. The outstanding card loan balances with Citi ($131 million\nas of June 30, 2023) are to be settled upon referral and\nrefinancing, and the portfolio has not been designated as held-\nfor-sale (HFS). For additional information about Citi\u2019s\ncontinued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in\nRussia, see \u201c Institutional Clients Group \u201d above and \u201cManaging\nGlobal Risk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country Risk\u2014Russia\u201d below, as well as\n\u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nAt June 30, 2023, on a combined basis, Legacy Franchises had\n1,413 retail branches, $21 billion in retail banking loans and\n$53 billion in deposits. In addition, the businesses had $9\nbillion in outstanding card loan balances, and Mexico SBMM had\n$8 billion in outstanding corporate loan balances. These loan\nand deposit amounts exclude approximately $8 billion of loans\n($7 billion of retail banking loans and $1 billion of credit\ncard loan balances) and approximately $11 billion of deposits,\nall of which were reclassified to HFS (e.g., as Other assets and\nOther liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) as a result\nof Citi\u2019s entry into agreements to sell certain remaining\nconsumer banking businesses.

These increases were\npartially offset by higher\nexpenses and lower income tax\nbenefits.

Large\nbanking organizations, such as\nCiti, would be required to\ncalculate their risk-based\ncapital ratios under both the\nnew expanded risk-based\napproach and the Standardized\nApproach and use the lower of\nthe two for each risk-based\ncapital ratio for determining\nthe binding constraints.\n\nThe expanded risk-based\napproach is designed to align\nwith the international capital\nstandards adopted by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking\nSupervision (Basel Committee).\nThe Basel Committee finalized\nthe Basel III reforms in\nDecember 2017, which included\nrevisions to the methodologies\nto determine credit, market\nand operational risk-weighted\nasset amounts.\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the\ncapital proposal\u2019s impact on\nrisk-weighted asset amounts\nwould also affect several\nother requirements including\nTLAC, external long-term debt\nand the short-term wholesale\nfunding score included in the\nGSIB surcharge under method 2\n(see \u201cGSIB Surcharge\u201d below\nfor additional changes in that\narea). The proposal has a\nthree-year transition period\nthat would begin on July 1,\n2025. Citi is currently\nreviewing the proposal and\nwill participate in the\n120-day comment period. For\nadditional information, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d above.\n                                                                \n  GSIB Surcharge                                                \n                                                                \nSeparately, the FRB proposed\nchanges to the GSIB surcharge\nrule that aim to make it more\nrisk sensitive. Proposed\nchanges include measuring\ncertain systemic indicators on\na daily versus quarterly\naverage basis, changing\ncertain of the risk\nindicators, and shortening the\ntime to come into compliance\nwith each year\u2019s surcharge. In\naddition, the proposal would\nnarrow surcharge bands under\nmethod 2 from 50 bps to 10 bps\nto reduce cliff effects when\nmoving between bands. This\nproposal is also subject to a\n120-day comment period and\nprovides that it would be\neffective two full calendar\nquarters after its\nfinalization.\n                               33                               \nTangible Common Equity, Book\nValue Per Share, Tangible Book\nValue Per Share and Return on\nEquity\n\nTangible common equity (TCE),\nas defined by Citi, represents\ncommon stockholders\u2019 equity\nless goodwill and identifiable\nintangible assets (other than\nmortgage servicing rights\n(MSRs)).

Citi\u2019s loan portfolio\nis well diversified across consumer and corporate loans, with an\naggregate duration of 1.2 years, as a majority of loans are at\nvariable rates. On an average basis, loans were largely\nunchanged year-over-year and sequentially as growth in PBWM was\noffset by a decline in ICG and Legacy Franchises. PBWM average\nloans increased 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by loan\ngrowth in cards, mortgages and installment lending. ICG average\nloans decreased 6% year-over-year, reflecting actions taken to\nreduce RWA. Legacy Franchises average loans decreased 14%,\nprimarily reflecting the impact of the continued wind-downs,\nparticularly in Korea, partially offset by higher lending\nvolumes in Mexico Consumer.\n\nEnd-of-period loans increased 1% year-over-year, as growth in\nPBWM , reflecting an increase in U.S. Personal Banking, was\nlargely offset by declines in ICG and Legacy Franchises.

Risk ratings\nand classifications are\nreviewed regularly and\nadjusted as appropriate. The\ncredit review process\nincorporates quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including\nfinancial and non-financial\ndisclosures or metrics,\nidiosyncratic events or\nchanges to the competitive,\nregulatory or macroeconomic\nenvironment. Citi believes the\ncorporate credit portfolio to\nbe appropriately rated and\nclassified as of June 30,\n2023. Citi has taken action to\nadjust internal ratings and\nclassifications of exposures\nas both the macroeconomic\nenvironment and obligor-\nspecific factors have changed,\nparticularly where additional\nstress has been seen.\n                               37                               \nAs obligor risk ratings are\ndowngraded, the probability of\ndefault increases. Downgrades\nof obligor risk ratings tend\nto result in a higher\nprovision for credit losses.\nIn addition, appetite per\nobligor is reduced consistent\nwith the ratings, and\ndowngrades may result in the\npurchase of additional credit\nderivatives or other\nrisk/structural mitigants to\nhedge the incremental credit\nrisk, or may result in Citi\u2019s\nseeking to reduce exposure to\nan obligor or an industry\nsector. Citi will continue to\nreview exposures to ensure\nthat the appropriate\nprobability of default is\nincorporated into all risk\nassessments.

As of June\n30, 2023, 44% of PBWM consumer\nloans consisted of U.S. cards\nloans. U.S. cards net credit\nlosses represented\napproximately 93% of total\nPBWM losses. As shown in the\nchart above, the second\nquarter of 2023 net credit\nloss rate in PBWM increased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, driven by a\ncontinued increase in net flow\nrates, primarily reflecting\nongoing normalization from\nrecent low levels in U.S.\ncards. PBWM \u2019s 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate was\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter, and increased year-\nover-year. The year-over-year\nincrease was largely driven by\na continued increase in net\nflow rates, primarily\nreflecting the ongoing\nnormalization in U.S. cards.\n                 \n  Branded Cards  \n                 \nU.S. Personal Banking\u2019s\nBranded cards portfolio\nincludes proprietary and co-\nbranded cards. As shown in the\nchart above, the second\nquarter of 2023 net credit\nloss rate in Branded cards\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, driven by\na continued increase in net\nflow rates, primarily\nreflecting ongoing\nnormalization toward pre-\npandemic levels from recent\nlow levels (for example, the\n4Q\u201919 and 1Q\u201920 net credit\nloss rates were 3.10% and\n3.40%, respectively). The 90+\ndays past due delinquency rate\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, also\ndriven by a continued increase\nin net flow rates, primarily\nreflecting the ongoing\nnormalization toward pre-\npandemic levels from recent\nlow levels (for example, the\n4Q\u201919 and 1Q\u201920 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rates were\n0.95% and 1.01%,\nrespectively).\n                   \n  Retail Services  \n                   \nU.S. Personal Banking\u2019s Retail\nservices partners directly\nwith more than 20 retailers\nand dealers to offer private\nlabel and co-branded cards.\nRetail services\u2019 target market\nfocuses on select industry\nsegments such as home\nimprovement, specialty retail,\nconsumer electronics and fuel.\nRetail services continually\nevaluates opportunities to add\npartners within target\nindustries that have strong\nloyalty, lending or payment\nprograms and growth potential.\nAs shown in the chart above,\nthe second quarter of 2023 net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nservices increased quarter-\nover-quarter and year-over-\nyear, driven by a continued\nincrease in net flow rates,\nprimarily reflecting the\nongoing normalization toward\npre-pandemic levels from\nrecent low levels (for\nexample, the 4Q\u201919 and 1Q\u201920\nnet credit loss rates were\n5.05% and 5.35%,\nrespectively). The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate was\nbroadly stable quarter-over-\nquarter, and increased year-\nover-year. The year-over-year\nincrease was driven by a\ncontinued increase in net flow\nrates, primarily reflecting\nthe ongoing normalization (for\nexample, the 4Q\u201919 and 1Q\u201920\n90+ days past due delinquency\nrates were 1.91% and 1.96%,\nrespectively).

The portfolio is\ngenerally delinquency managed,\nwhere Citi evaluates credit\nrisk based on FICO scores,\ndelinquencies and the value of\nunderlying collateral. The\nconsumer mortgages in this\nportfolio have historically\nbeen extended to high credit\nquality customers, generally\nwith loan-to-value ratios that\nare less than or equal to 80%\non first and second mortgages.\nFor additional information,\nsee \u201cLoan-to-Value (LTV)\nRatios\u201d in Note 13. As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in Retail\nbanking for the second quarter\nof 2023 decreased quarter-\nover-quarter, due to a\ndecrease in overdraft losses,\nand decreased year-over-year,\nprimarily driven by the impact\nof industry-wide episodic\noverdraft losses in the prior-\nyear period. The 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rate decreased\nquarter-over-quarter and year-\nover-year, primarily driven by\nlower delinquencies in U.S.\nmortgages, which reflected the\nlasting effects of government\nstimulus, unemployment\nbenefits and consumer relief\nprograms.\n                 \n  Global Wealth  \n                 \nAs discussed above, the Global\nWealth credit portfolio\nprimarily consists of consumer\nmortgages, cards and other\nlending products extended to\ncustomer segments that range\nfrom the affluent to ultra-\nhigh-net-worth through the\nPrivate bank, Wealth at Work\nand Citigold. These customer\nsegments represent a target\nmarket that is characterized\nby historically low default\nrates and delinquencies. As of\nJune 30, 2023, approximately\n$48 billion, or 32%, of the\nportfolio was classifiably\nmanaged and primarily\nconsisted of margin lending,\ncommercial real estate,\nsubscription credit finance\nand other lending programs.\nThese\n\nclassifiably managed loans are\nprimarily evaluated for credit\nrisk based on their internal\nrisk rating, of which 97% is\nrated investment grade. While\nthe delinquency rate in the\nchart above is calculated only\nfor the delinquency-managed\nportfolio, the net credit loss\nrate is calculated using net\ncredit losses for both the\ndelinquency and classifiably\nmanaged portfolios. As shown\nin the chart above, the net\ncredit loss and 90+ days past\ndue delinquency rates in\nGlobal Wealth for the second\nquarter of 2023 were broadly\nstable quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year. The low\nlevels of net credit losses\nand the 90+ days past due\ndelinquency rate continued to\nreflect the strong credit\nprofiles of the portfolios.\nLegacy Franchises\n                   \n  Asia(1)Consumer  \n                   \n(1) Asia Consumer includes\nLegacy Franchises activities\nin certain EMEA countries for\nall periods presented. Asia\nConsumer provides credit\ncards, consumer mortgages and\nsmall business and personal\nloans. Asia Consumer also\nincludes loans and leases in\ncertain EMEA countries for all\nperiods presented. As shown in\nthe chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in Asia\nConsumer (for the remaining\nconsumer banking portfolios\nheld-for-investment (China,\nKorea, Russia and Poland)) for\nthe second quarter of 2023\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year. The\nincreases were primarily\ndriven by lower average loans\ndue to the ongoing wind-downs\nof the remaining businesses,\nparticularly Korea, and the\nreclassification of a\nportfolio to HFS in the first\nquarter of 2023. The 90+ days\npast due delinquency rate was\nunchanged quarter-over-quarter\nand increased year-over-year,\nmainly driven by lower loans\ndue to the ongoing wind-downs\nof the remaining businesses\nand the reclassification of a\nportfolio to HFS in the first\nquarter of 2023. The overall\nperformance of the remaining\nAsia Consumer portfolios\ncontinues to reflect the\nstrong credit profiles of the\ncustomer segments.\n                               44                               \n                   \n  Mexico Consumer  \n                   \nMexico Consumer operates in\nMexico through Citibanamex and\nprovides cards, consumer\nmortgages and small business\nand personal loans. Mexico\nConsumer serves a more mass-\nmarket segment in Mexico and\nfocuses on developing\nmultiproduct relationships\nwith customers. As shown in\nthe chart above, the net\ncredit loss rate in Mexico\nConsumer for the second\nquarter of 2023 decreased\nquarter-over-quarter,\nprimarily due to higher\nrecoveries in the second\nquarter of 2023, and increased\nyear-over-year, primarily\ndriven by the gradual\nnormalization of loss rates\nafter peak losses experienced\nduring the pandemic. The 90+\ndays past due delinquency rate\nincreased quarter-over-quarter\nand year-over-year, driven by\nthe gradual normalization of\ndelinquency rates after peak\ndelinquencies during the\npandemic.

The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $73 million ($0.5 billion), $80 million ($0.6\nbillion) and $119 million ($0.7 billion) at June 30, 2023, March\n31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The amounts excluded\nfor loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans\nhave the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans)\nwere $68 million, $57 million and $72 million at June 30, 2023,\nMarch 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in\nthe table include the guaranteed loans.\n\n(4) The 90+ days past due balances for Branded cards and Retail\nservices are generally still accruing interest. Citi\u2019s policy is\ngenerally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days\npast due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been\nreceived earlier.\n\n(5) Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private bank loans. These\nloans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator\nand ratios.\n\n(6) These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-\noff primarily based on their internal risk classification and\nnot solely on their delinquency status, and therefore\ndelinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of June 30,\n2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, 97%, 93% and 94% of\nGlobal Wealth classifiably managed loans were rated investment\ngrade. For additional information on the credit quality of the\nGlobal Wealth portfolio, including classifiably managed\nportfolios, see \u201cConsumer Credit Trends\u201d above.\n\n(7) Asia Consumer includes delinquencies and loans in certain\nEMEA countries for all periods presented.\n                               46                               \n(8) Citi has entered into agreements to sell certain Asia\nconsumer banking businesses. Accordingly, the loans of these\nbusinesses have been reclassified as HFS in Other assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet, and hence the loans and related\ndelinquencies and ratios are not included in this table. The\nreclassifications commenced as follows: Bahrain, India,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam in 1Q22\n(Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand closed in 4Q22; India and\nVietnam closed in 1Q23). In addition, a portfolio was\nreclassified to HFS in the first quarter of 2023. See Note 2 for\nadditional information.\n\n(9) The 90+ days past due and 30\u201389 days past due and related\nratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to\nU.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies\nsince the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the\nU.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and\n(EOP loans) were $77 million ($0.2 billion), $81 million ($0.3\nbillion) and $84 million ($0.2 billion) at June 30, 2023, March\n31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The amounts excluded\nfor loans 30\u201389 days past due (the 30\u201389 days past due EOP loans\nhave the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans)\nwere $31 million, $30 million and $27 million at June 30, 2023,\nMarch 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively.

Corporate non-accrual\nloans may still be current on interest payments. With limited\nexceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer\nloans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are\nplaced on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged\noff at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed\non non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to\nnet realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with\nindustry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on\ncredit card loans until such loans are charged off, which\ntypically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such,\nthe non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card\nloans. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within\nCorporate loans and Consumer loans on the Consolidated Balance\nSheet.\n\n(2) Approximately 51%, 61%, 50%, 68% and 52% of Citi\u2019s corporate\nnon-accrual loans were performing at June 30, 2023, March 31,\n2023, December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022,\nrespectively.\n\n(3) The June 30, 2023 total corporate non-accrual loans\nrepresented 0.44% of total cor porate loans .\n\n(4) Asia Consumer includes balances in certain EMEA countries\nfor all periods presented.\n                                                                \n  Modified Loans                                                \n                                                                \nOn January 1, 2023, Citi\nadopted ASU 2022-02, which\neliminated the accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for\nTDRs (see Note 1 for\nadditional information).

On an average\nbasis, deposits increased 1% year-over-year and were down 2%\nsequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected an\nincrease in Corporate/Other and ICG , partially offset by a\ndecline in PBWM . Corporate/Other average deposits increased $12\nbillion year-over-year, primarily driven by the issuance of\ninstitutional certificates of deposit. ICG average deposits\nincreased 1% year-over-year, driven by TTS. PBWM average\ndeposits decreased 1% year-over-year, largely reflecting the\nreallocation of deposits to higher-yielding investments. Legacy\nFranchises average deposits were largely unchanged year-over-\nyear. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was largely driven by\nTTS, reflecting some non-operational outflows as expected in\nlight of quantitative tightening, and Corporate/Other . Despite\nthis decline, TTS had strong growth in operating accounts as the\nbusiness continued to attract new clients and deepen existing\nrelationships. End-of-period deposits were largely unchanged\nyear-over-year, as an increase in institutional certificates of\ndeposit in Corporate/Other was offset by a decrease in ICG ,\ndriven by Securities services . End-of-period deposits decreased\n1% sequentially, reflecting seasonal activity in TTS and Global\nWealth. The majority of Citi\u2019s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period\ndeposits are institutional (approximately $818 billion), and\nspan approximately 90 countries. A large majority of these\ninstitutional deposits are within TTS, and of these,\napproximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS\nintegrated services: payments and collections, liquidity\nmanagement and working capital solutions. In addition, nearly\n80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a greater than\n15-year relationship with Citi. Over the past year, TTS deposits\ngrew at a faster rate than total Citi deposits on both an\naverage and end-of-period basis. Citi also has a strong consumer\nand wealth deposit base, with $427 billion of U.S. Retail\nbanking and Global Wealth deposits as of end-of-period, which\nare diversified across the Private bank, Citigold, Retail\nbanking and Wealth at Work. As of year-end 2022, approximately\n75% of U.S. Citigold clients have been with Citi for more than\n10 years and approximately 50% of Private bank ultra-high-net-\nworth clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years. U.S.\nPersonal Banking deposits are spread across six core urban\ncenters.\n                               55                               \nLong-Term Debt Weighted\nAverage Maturity (WAM) The\nfollowing table presents\nCitigroup and its affiliates\u2019\n(including Citibank) WAM of\nunsecured long-term debt\nissued with a remaining life\ngreater than one year:\n                                                                \n  WAM in             Jun. 30,                         Jun. 30,  \n  years                  2023    Mar. 31, 2023            2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Unsecured               7.7              7.5             8.0  \n  debt                                                          \n  Non-bank                                                      \n  benchmark               7.3              7.2             7.5  \n  debt                                                          \n  TLAC-eligi\u2026             8.9              8.8             9.1  \n  debt                                                          \n                                                                \nThe WAM is calculated based on\nthe contractual maturity of\neach security.

(1) Non-bank\nincludes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent\nholding company (Citigroup) and Citi\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries\n(including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated\ninto Citigroup. As of June 30, 2023, non-bank included $92.4\nbillion of long-term debt issued by Citi\u2019s broker-dealer and\nother subsidiaries that are consolidated into\n\nCitigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are\nalso included in this line. (2) Local country and other includes\ndebt issued by Citi\u2019s affiliates in support of their local\noperations. Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also\nincluded. (3) Predominantly credit card securitizations,\nprimarily backed by Branded cards receivables. Citi\u2019s total\nlong-term debt outstanding increased 7% year-over-year, largely\ndriven by the issuance of customer-related debt at the non-bank\nentities and increased FHLB borrowings at the bank. The increase\nwas partially offset by the decline in senior benchmark debt at\nthe non-bank entities, as well as lower securitizations at the\nbank. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding decreased 2%,\nlargely driven by a decline in senior benchmark debt at the non-\nbank entities. As part of its liability management, Citi has\nconsidered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to\nredeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market\npurchases, tender offers or other means.

Funding Transactions\nand Short-Term Borrowings\n\nCiti supplements its primary\nsources of funding with short-\nterm financings that generally\ninclude (i) secured funding\ntransactions consisting of\nsecurities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to\nrepurchase, i.e., repos, and\n(ii) to a lesser extent,\nshort-term borrowings\nconsisting of commercial paper\nand borrowings from the FHLB\nand other market participants.\n                                                                \n  Secured Funding Transactions                                  \n                                                                \nSecured funding is primarily\naccessed through Citi\u2019s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries,\nwith a smaller portion\nexecuted through Citi\u2019s bank\nentities to efficiently fund\nboth (i) secured lending\nactivity and (ii) a portion of\nthe securities inventory held\nin the context of market\nmaking and customer\nactivities. Secured funding\ntransactions are predominantly\ncollateralized by government\ndebt securities. Generally,\nchanges in the level of Citi\u2019s\nsecured funding are primarily\ndue to fluctuations in secured\nlending activity in the\nmatched book (as described\nbelow) and changes in\nsecurities inventory. In order\nto maintain reliable funding\nunder a wide range of market\nconditions, Citi manages risks\nrelated to its secured funding\nby establishing secured\nfunding limits and conducting\ndaily stress tests that\naccount for risks related to\ncapacity, tenor, haircut,\ncollateral type, counterparty\nand client actions.\n\nSecured funding of $260\nbillion as of June 30, 2023\nincreased 31% year-over-year\nand 1% sequentially, largely\ndriven by additional financing\nto support increases in\ntrading-related assets within\nCiti\u2019s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries. As of the\nquarter ended June 30, 2023,\non an average basis, secured\nfunding was $262 billion. The\nportion of secured funding in\nthe broker-dealer subsidiaries\nthat funds secured lending is\ncommonly referred to as\n\u201cmatched book\u201d activity and is\nprimarily secured by high-\nquality liquid securities such\nas U.S. Treasury securities,\nU.S. agency securities and\nforeign government debt\nsecurities. Other \u201cmatched\nbook\u201d activity is secured by\nless liquid securities,\nincluding equity securities,\ncorporate bonds and asset-\nbacked securities, the tenor\nof which is generally equal to\nor longer than the tenor of\nthe corresponding assets. As\nindicated above, the remaining\nportion of secured funding is\nused to fund securities\ninventory held in the context\nof market making and customer\nactivities.\n                                                                \n  Short-Term Borrowings                                         \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s short-term borrowings\nof $40 billion as of the\nsecond quarter of 2023 was\nlargely unchanged both year-\nover-year and sequentially\n(see Note 17 for further\ninformation on Citigroup\u2019s and\nits affiliates\u2019 outstanding\nshort-term borrowings).\n                               58                               \n                                                                \n  Credit Ratings                                                \n                                                                \nThe table below presents the\nratings for Citigroup and\nCitibank as of June 30, 2023.\nWhile not included in the\ntable below, the long-term and\nshort-term ratings of\nCitigroup Global Markets\nHoldings Inc.

Other funding\nsources, such as secured\nfunding transactions and other\nmargin requirements, for which\nthere are no explicit\ntriggers, could also be\nadversely affected.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, Citi\nestimates that a hypothetical\none-notch downgrade of the\nsenior debt/long-term rating\nof Citibank across all three\nmajor rating agencies could\nimpact Citibank\u2019s funding and\nliquidity due to derivative\ntriggers by approximately $0.4\nbillion, compared to $0.3\nbillion as of March 31, 2023.\nOther funding sources, such as\nsecured funding transactions\nand other margin requirements,\nfor which there are no\nexplicit triggers, could also\nbe adversely impacted.\n\nIn total, as of June 30, 2023,\nCiti estimates that a one-\nnotch downgrade of Citigroup\nInc. and Citibank across all\nthree major rating agencies\ncould result in increased\naggregate cash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $0.8 billion,\ncompared to $0.6 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2023 (see also Note\n21). As detailed under \u201cHigh-\nQuality Liquid Assets (HQLA)\u201d\nabove, Citigroup has various\nliquidity resources available\nto its bank and non-bank\nentities in part as a\ncontingency for the potential\nevents described above.\n\nCitibank\u2014Additional Potential\nImpacts\n\nIn addition to the above\nderivative triggers, Citi\nbelieves that a potential\ndowngrade of Citibank\u2019s senior\ndebt/long-term rating across\nany of the three major rating\nagencies could also have an\nadverse impact on the\ncommercial paper/short-term\nrating of Citibank. Citibank\nhas provided liquidity\ncommitments to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, primarily in the\nform of asset purchase\nagreements. As of June 30,\n2023, Citibank had liquidity\ncommitments of approximately\n$10.9 billion to consolidated\nasset-backed commercial paper\nconduits, which was largely\nunchanged from March 31, 2023\n(see Note 20 for additional\ninformation).\n\nIn addition to the above-\nreferenced liquidity resources\nof certain Citibank entities,\nCitibank could reduce the\nfunding and liquidity risk, if\nany, of the potential\ndowngrades described above\nthrough mitigating actions,\nincluding repricing or\nreducing certain commitments\nto commercial paper conduits.\nIn the event of the potential\ndowngrades described above,\nCiti believes that certain\ncorporate customers could\nreevaluate their deposit\nrelationships with Citibank.\nThis reevaluation could result\nin clients adjusting their\ndiscretionary deposit levels\nor changing their depository\ninstitution, which could\npotentially reduce certain\ndeposit levels at Citibank.\nHowever, Citi could choose to\nadjust pricing, offer\nalternative deposit products\nto its existing customers or\nseek to attract deposits from\nnew customers, in addition to\nthe mitigating actions\nreferenced above.\n                               59                               \n                                                                \n  MARKET RISK                                                   \n                                                                \nMarket risk arises from both\nCiti\u2019s trading and non-trading\nportfolios.

Market\nrisk from non-trading\nportfolios also includes the\npotential impact of changes in\nforeign exchange rates on\nCiti\u2019s capital invested in\nforeign currencies.\n                                                                \n  Banking Book Interest Rate Risk                               \n                                                                \nFor interest rate risk\npurposes, Citi\u2019s non-trading\nportfolios are referred to as\nthe Banking Book. Management\nof interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book is governed by\nCiti\u2019s Non-Trading Market Risk\nPolicy. Management\u2019s Asset &\nLiability Committee (ALCO)\nestablishes Citi\u2019s risk\nappetite and related limits\nfor interest rate risk in the\nBanking Book, which are\nsubject to approval by\nCitigroup\u2019s Board of\nDirectors. Corporate Treasury\nis responsible for the day-to-\nday management of Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book interest rate\nrisk as well as periodically\nreviewing it with the ALCO.\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book interest\nrate risk management is also\nsubject to independent\noversight from the second line\nof defense team reporting to\nthe Chief Risk Officer.\n\nChanges in interest rates\nimpact Citi\u2019s net income, AOCI\nand CET1. These changes\nprimarily affect Citi\u2019s\nBanking Book through net\ninterest income, due to a\nvariety of risk factors,\nincluding:\n\n\u2022 Differences in timing and\namounts of the maturity or\nrepricing of assets,\nliabilities and off-balance\nsheet instruments;\n\n\u2022 Changes in the level and/or\nshape of interest rate curves;\n\n\u2022 Client behavior in response\nto changes in interest rates\n(e.g., mortgage prepayments,\ndeposit betas); and\n\n\u2022 Changes in the maturity of\ninstruments resulting from\nchanges in the interest rate\nenvironment.\n\nAs part of their ongoing\nactivities, Citi\u2019s businesses\ngenerate interest rate-\nsensitive positions from their\nclient-facing products, such\nas loans and deposits. The\ncomponent of this interest\nrate risk that can be hedged\nis transferred via Citi\u2019s\nfunds transfer pricing process\nto Corporate Treasury.\nCorporate Treasury uses\nvarious tools to manage the\ntotal interest rate risk\nposition within the\nestablished risk appetite and\ntarget Citi\u2019s desired risk\nprofile, including its\ninvestment securities\nportfolio, company-issued debt\nand interest rate derivatives.\n\nIn addition, Citi uses\nmultiple metrics to measure\nits Banking Book interest rate\nrisk. Interest Rate Exposure\n(IRE) is a key metric that\nanalyzes the impact of a range\nof scenarios on Citi\u2019s Banking\nBook net interest income and\ncertain other interest rate-\nsensitive income versus a base\ncase. IRE does not represent a\nforecast of Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income.\n\nThe scenarios, methodologies\nand assumptions used in this\nanalysis are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in\nresponse to changes in the\nmarket environment, changes in\nCiti\u2019s balance sheet\ncomposition, enhancements in\nCiti\u2019s modeling and other\nfactors.\n\nSince the third quarter of\n2022, Citi has employed\nenhanced IRE methodologies and\nchanges to certain\nassumptions. The changes\nincluded, among other things,\nassumptions around the\nprojected balance sheet and\nrevisions to the treatment of\ncertain business contributions\n(notably accrual positions in\nICG \u2019s Markets businesses).\nThese changes resulted in a\nhigher impact to Citi\u2019s net\ninterest income over a\n12-month period.\n\nUnder the enhanced\nmethodology, Citi utilizes the\nmost recent quarter-end\nbalance sheet, assuming no\nchanges to its composition and\nsize over the forecasted\nhorizon (holding the balance\nsheet static). The forecasts\nincorporate expectations and\nassumptions of deposit\npricing, loan spreads and\nmortgage prepayment behavior\nimplied by the interest rate\ncurves in each scenario. The\nbase case scenario reflects\nthe market implied forward\ninterest rates, and\nsensitivity scenarios assume\ninstantaneous shocks to the\nbase case. The forecasts do\nnot assume Citi takes any\nrisk-mitigating actions in\nresponse to changes in the\ninterest rate environment.\nCertain interest rates are\nsubject to flooring\nassumptions in downward rate\nscenarios. Deposit pricing\nsensitivities (i.e., deposit\nbetas), are informed by\nhistorical and expected\nbehavior. Actual deposit\npricing could differ from the\nassumptions used in these\nforecasts.\n\nCiti\u2019s IRE analysis primarily\nreflects the impacts from the\nfollowing Banking Book assets\nand liabilities: loans, client\ndeposits, Citi\u2019s deposits with\nother banks, investment\nsecurities, long-term debt,\nany related interest rate\nhedges and the funds transfer\npricing of positions in total\ntrading and credit portfolio\nvalue at risk (VAR). It\nexcludes impacts from any\npositions that are included in\ntotal trading and credit\nportfolio VAR.\n\nIn addition to IRE, Citi\nanalyzes economic value\nsensitivity (EVS) as a longer-\nterm interest rate risk\nmetric. EVS is a net present\nvalue (NPV)\u2013based measure of\nthe lifetime cash flows of\nCiti\u2019s Banking Book. It\nestimates the interest rate\nsensitivity of the Banking\nBook\u2019s economic value from\nlonger-term assets being\npotentially funded with\nshorter-term liabilities, or\nvice versa.

For\nnon-U.S. dollar currencies,\nexposure to downward rate\nshocks is smaller in magnitude\nas a result of Citi\u2019s flooring\nassumption, given low rate\nlevels for certain non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\n\nThe magnitude of the impact to\nAOCI is greater under Scenario\n2 compared to Scenario 3. This\nis because the combination of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio, partially offset by\nchanges related to Citi\u2019s\npension liabilities, results\nin a net position that is more\nsensitive to rates at shorter-\nand intermediate-term\nmaturities.\n                               62                               \nChanges in Foreign Exchange\nRates\u2014Impacts on AOCI and\nCapital\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, Citi\nestimates that an\nunanticipated parallel\ninstantaneous 5% appreciation\nof the U.S. dollar against all\nof the other currencies in\nwhich Citi has invested\ncapital could reduce Citi\u2019s\ntangible common equity (TCE)\nby approximately $1.7 billion,\nor 0.96%, as a result of\nchanges to Citi\u2019s CTA in AOCI\n, net of hedges. This impact\nwould be primarily due to\nchanges in the value of the\nMexican peso, Euro and Indian\nrupee.\n\nThis impact is also before any\nmitigating actions Citi may\ntake, including ongoing\nmanagement of its foreign\ncurrency\n\ntranslation exposure.\nSpecifically, as currency\nmovements change the value of\nCiti\u2019s net investments in\nforeign currency-denominated\ncapital, these movements also\nchange the value of Citi\u2019s\nrisk-weighted assets\ndenominated in those\ncurrencies.\n\nThis, coupled with Citi\u2019s\nforeign currency hedging\nstrategies, such as foreign\ncurrency borrowings, foreign\ncurrency forwards and other\ncurrency hedging instruments,\nlessens the impact of foreign\ncurrency movements on Citi\u2019s\nCET1 Capital ratio. Changes in\nthese hedging strategies, as\nwell as hedging costs,\ndivestitures and tax impacts,\ncan further affect the actual\nimpact of changes in foreign\nexchange rates on Citi\u2019s\ncapital compared to an\nunanticipated parallel shock,\nas described above.\n\nThe effect of Citi\u2019s ongoing\nmanagement strategies with\nrespect to quarterly changes\nin foreign exchange rates, and\nthe quarterly impact of these\nchanges on Citi\u2019s TCE and CET1\nCapital ratio, are shown in\nthe table below.

table\nabove, Citi\u2019s net interest\nincome on a taxable equivalent\nbasis also increased 16% year-\nover-year, or $1.9 billion.\nThe increase was driven by\nhigher net interest income in\nnon- ICG Markets, which\nincreased 12%, and ICG\nMarkets, which increased 46%.\nThe increase in net interest\nincome in non- ICG Markets\nprimarily reflected higher\ninterest rates, growth in U.S.\ncards interest-earning\nbalances and higher income\nfrom Citi\u2019s investment\nportfolio, partially offset by\nthe reduction from the exited\nmarkets and continued wind-\ndowns in Legacy Franchises .\nThe increase in ICG Markets\nnet interest income was\nprimarily driven by higher\ninterest rates as well as a\nchange in the mix of trading\npositions in support of client\nactivity.\n\nCiti\u2019s net interest margin was\n2.48% on a taxable equivalent\nbasis in the second quarter of\n2023, an increase of 7 basis\npoints from the prior quarter,\nprimarily driven by the\nbenefits of dividend\nseasonality in ICG Markets and\nhigher interest rates,\npartially offset by a mix\nshift to higher cost deposits.\n                               65                               \n

The benefit reflects the\nfact that the risks within individual and across risk types are\nnot perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VAR on a\ngiven day will be lower than the sum of the VARs relating to\neach risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of\nchanges to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination\nof the impact of both model parameter and position changes.\n\n(2) The total trading VAR includes mark-to-market and certain\nfair value option trading positions in ICG , with the exception\nof hedges to the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all\nCVA exposures.

Regulatory VAR back-\ntesting is the process in which the daily one-day VAR, at a 99%\nconfidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and\nloss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held\nconstant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day).\nBuy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market\nprofit and loss attributable to price movements in covered\npositions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-\nhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net\ninterest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and\nloss and changes in reserves. Based on a 99% confidence level,\nCiti would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-\nand-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VAR. Given the\nconservative calibration of Citi\u2019s VAR model (as a result of\ntaking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-\ntail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer\nexceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of\nunstable market conditions could increase the number of back-\ntesting exceptions. As of June 30, 2023, there was one back-\ntesting exception observed for Citi\u2019s Regulatory VAR in the last\n12 months.\n\nOTHER RISKS For additional information regarding other risks,\nincluding Citi\u2019s management of other risks, see \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. LIBOR Transition\nRisk The USD LIBOR bank panel ended on June 30, 2023. The\novernight and 12-month USD LIBOR settings have now permanently\nceased, and the Financial Conduct Authority is requiring ICE\nBenchmark Administration to continue publishing one-, three- and\nsix-month USD LIBOR settings using a synthetic methodology,\nwhich is based on the relevant CME Term SOFR Reference Rate plus\nthe respective ISDA fixed spread adjustment. These synthetic\nsettings are permanently unrepresentative of the underlying\nmarkets they previously sought to measure and are expected to\ncease on September 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2023, Citi has\ntransitioned nearly all of its USD LIBOR-referencing contracts\nto SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment. Remediation was\naccomplished through a range of methods. With respect to\nderivatives, most bilateral contracts were remediated through\nadherence to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocols or bilateral\namendments, and cleared contracts were remediated through\nconversions completed by central counterparty clearing houses.\nMost loan contracts were remediated through amendments that\nprovided for either an immediate transition to SOFR or a\ntransition on the first interest payment date immediately\nfollowing June 30, 2023. With respect to securities, contracts\ngoverned by U.S. law transitioned to SOFR by operation of law\npursuant to the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act or pursuant\nto Citi\u2019s exercise of discretion as the determining person with\nthe authority to select a replacement rate. Securities contracts\nnot governed by U.S. law were primarily remediated through\nconsent solicitations or Citi\u2019s exercise of discretion as the\ndetermining person with the authority to select a replacement\nrate. As of June 30, 2023, there were a de minimis number of\nunremediated USD LIBOR-referencing contracts. Most of these\ncontracts relate to non-U.S.-law-governed securities and loans\nthat will temporarily utilize synthetic LIBOR. Citi will\ncontinue to focus on remediating its remaining unremediated\ncontracts.

For example, a loan\nto a Chinese subsidiary of a\nSwitzerland-based corporation\nwill generally be categorized\nas a loan in China. In\naddition, Citi has developed\nregional booking centers in\ncertain countries,\n\nmost significantly in the\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.) and\nIreland, in order to more\nefficiently serve its\ncorporate customers.

Citi is unable to remit these funds\nto clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian\ngovernment.\n\n(6) The majority of AO Citibank\u2019s third-party exposures was\nfunded with the dividends under footnote 5 and domestic deposit\nliabilities from both corporate and personal banking clients.\n\n(7) Citigroup\u2019s CTA loss included in its AOCI related to its\nindirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, is excluded from the above\ntable, because the CTA loss is not held in AO Citibank and would\nbe recognized in Citigroup\u2019s earnings only upon either the\nsubstantial liquidation or a loss of control of AO Citibank.\nCiti has separately described these risks in \u201cDeconsolidation\nRisk\u201d below.\n                               73                               \nDuring the second quarter of\n2023, Citi\u2019s Russia-related\nexposures increased by $0.5\nbillion, as shown in the table\nabove. The increase in\nexposure was driven by $1.7\nbillion of dividends that Citi\nreceived as custodian for\ninvestor clients in Russia and\nis unable to remit due to\nRussian regulatory\nrestrictions (trapped\ndividends), partially offset\nby deposit outflows as well as\na $0.6 billion depreciation of\nthe ruble against the U.S.\ndollar. A portion ($1 billion,\nnet of ruble depreciation) of\nthese dividends were placed in\nreverse repurchase agreements.\nRoughly 65% of Citi\u2019s\nremaining Russia exposures are\nthe trapped dividends\ndiscussed above.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued risk\nmitigation efforts have\nincluded ICG borrower paydowns\nand limiting extensions of new\ncredit.\n\nCiti\u2019s net investment in\nRussia was approximately $1.1\nbillion as of June 30, 2023\n(compared to $1.2 billion at\nMarch 31, 2023). Citi hedges\nits ruble/USD spot FX exposure\nin AOCI through the purchase\nof FX derivatives. The ongoing\nmark-to-market of the hedging\nderivatives is also reported\nin AOCI . When the ruble\ndepreciates against the USD,\nthe USD equivalent value of\nCitigroup\u2019s investment in AO\nCitibank also declines. This\nchange in value is offset by\nthe change in value of the\nhedging instrument (FX\nderivative). Going forward,\nCiti may record devaluations\non its net ruble-denominated\nassets in earnings, without\nthe benefit from a change in\nthe fair value of derivative\npositions used to economically\nhedge the exposures.\n                                                                \n  Earnings and Other Impacts on Citi\u2019s Businesses               \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s ICG , PBWM and Legacy\nFranchises segments and\nCorporate/Other have been\nimpacted by various\nmacroeconomic factors and\nvolatilities, including\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\nand its direct and indirect\nimpact on the European and\nglobal economies. For a\nbroader discussion of these\nfactors and volatilities on\nCiti\u2019s businesses, see\n\u201cExecutive Summary\u201d and each\nbusiness\u2019s results of\noperations above.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023,\nCitigroup\u2019s ACL included a\n$0.2 billion remaining credit\nreserve for Citi\u2019s direct and\nindirect Russian\ncounterparties (unchanged from\nMarch 31, 2023).\n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations                     \n                                                                \nDuring 2022, Citi disclosed\nits decision to wind down its\nRussia consumer, local\ncommercial and institutional\nbanking businesses, including\nactively pursuing portfolio\nsales. In connection with this\nwind-down, Citi currently\nexpects to incur approximately\n$180 million (compared to $210\nmillion at March 31, 2023) in\ntotal estimated charges ($40\nmillion in ICG and $140\nmillion in Legacy Franchises ,\nexcluding the impact from any\nportfolio sales), largely\ndriven by restructuring,\nvendor termination fees and\nother related charges. Citi\u2019s\npreviously disclosed referral\nagreement with a Russian bank\nto settle a portfolio of\nruble-denominated credit card\nloans, subject to customer\nconsent, was signed in May\n2023 and is in the execution\nphase. The outstanding amount\nwith Citi is to be settled\nupon referral and refinancing.\nAs a result, the credit card\nloans will remain held-for-\ninvestment and are not\ntransferred to held-for-sale.\nFor additional information\nabout Citi\u2019s continued efforts\nto reduce its operations and\nexposure in Russia, see Note 2\nand \u201cRisk\n\nFactors\u201d and \u201cManaging Global\nRisk\u2014Other Risks\u2014Country\nRisk\u2014Russia\u201d in Citi\u2019s 2022\nForm 10-K.\n                                                                \n  Deconsolidation Risk                                          \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s remaining operations in\nRussia subject it to various\nrisks, including, among\nothers, foreign currency\nvolatility, including\nappreciation or devaluation;\nrestrictions arising from\nretaliatory Russian laws and\nregulations on the conduct of\nits business; sanctions or\nasset freezes; or other\ndeconsolidation events (for\nadditional information, see\n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Other Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K).\nExamples of triggers that may\nresult in deconsolidation of\nAO Citibank include voluntary\nor forced sale of ownership or\nloss of control due to actions\nof relevant governmental\nauthorities, including\nexpropriation (i.e., the\nentity becomes subject to the\ncomplete control of a\ngovernment, court,\nadministrator, trustee or\nregulator); revocation of\nbanking license; and loss of\nability to elect a board of\ndirectors or appoint members\nof senior management. As of\nJune 30, 2023, Citi continued\nto consolidate AO Citibank\nbecause none of the\ndeconsolidation factors were\ntriggered.\n\nIn the event Citi deems there\nis a loss of control, for\nexample, through expropriation\nof AO Citibank Russia, Citi\u2019s\nforeign entity in Russia, Citi\nwould be required to (i) write\noff the net investment of\napproximately $1.1 billion\n(compared to $1.2 billion as\nof March 31, 2023), (ii)\nrecognize a CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\n(compared to $1.4 billion as\nof March 31, 2023) through\nearnings and (iii) recognize a\nloss of $0.4 billion\n(unchanged from March 31,\n2023) on intercompany\nliabilities owed by AO\nCitibank to other Citi\nentities outside Russia. In\nthe sole event of a\nsubstantial liquidation, as\nopposed to a loss of control,\nCiti would be required to\nrecognize the CTA loss of\napproximately $1.6 billion\nthrough earnings and would\nevaluate its remaining net\ninvestment as circumstances\nevolve.\n                                                                \n  Citi as Paying Agent for Russian-related Clients              \n                                                                \nCiti serves or served as\npaying agent on bonds issued\nby various entities in Russia,\nincluding Russian corporate\nclients. Citi\u2019s role as paying\nagent is administrative. In\nthis role, Citi acts as an\nagent of its client, the bond\nissuer, receiving interest and\nprincipal payments from the\nbond issuer and then making\npayments to international\ncentral securities\ndepositories (e.g., Depository\nTrust Company, Euroclear,\nClearstream). The\ninternational central\nsecurities depositories\n(ICSDs) make payments to those\nparticipants or account\nholders (e.g., broker/dealers)\nthat have clients who are\ninvestors in the applicable\nbonds (i.e., bondholders). As\na paying agent, Citi generally\ndoes not have information\nabout the identity of the\nbondholders. As a result of\nsanctions or other\ngovernmental requirements and\nprohibitions, Citi may be\nexposed to risks due to its\nresponsibilities for receiving\nand processing payments on\nbehalf of its clients. To\nmitigate operational and\nsanctions risks, Citi has\nestablished policies,\nprocedures and controls for\nclient relationships and\npayment processing to help\nensure compliance with U.S.,\nU.K., EU and other\njurisdictions\u2019 sanctions laws.\n\nThese processes may require\nCiti to delay or withhold the\nprocessing of payments as a\nresult of sanctions on the\nbond issuer. Citi is also\nprevented from making payments\nto\n                               74                               \naccounts on behalf of\nbondholders should the ICSDs\ndisclose to Citi the presence\nof sanctioned bondholders. In\nboth instances, Citi is\ngenerally required to\nsegregate, restrict or block\nthe funds until applicable\nsanctions are lifted or the\npayment is otherwise\nauthorized under applicable\nlaw.\n                                                                \n  Reputational Risks                                            \n                                                                \nCiti has continued its efforts\nto enhance and protect its\nreputation with its\ncolleagues, clients,\ncustomers, investors,\nregulators and the public.\nCiti\u2019s response to the war in\nUkraine, including any action\nor inaction, may have a\nnegative impact on Citi\u2019s\nreputation with some or all of\nthese parties.\n\nFor example, Citi is exposed\nto reputational risk as a\nresult of its current presence\nin Russia and association with\nRussian individuals or\nentities, whether subject to\nsanctions or not, including\nCiti\u2019s inability to support\nits global clients in Russia,\nwhich could adversely affect\nits broader client\nrelationships and businesses;\ncurrent involvement in\ntransactions or supporting\nactivities involving Russian\nassets or interests; failure\nto correctly interpret and\napply laws and regulations,\nincluding those related to\nsanctions; perceived\nmisalignment of Citi\u2019s actions\nto its stated strategy in\nRussia; and the reputational\nimpact from Citi\u2019s activity\nand engagement with Ukraine or\nwith non-Russian clients\nexiting their Russia\nbusinesses. Citi has\nconsidered the potential for\nreputation risk and taken\nactions to mitigate such\nrisks. Citi established a\nRussia Special Review Process\nwith management\u2019s Reputation\nRisk Committee with oversight\nfor significant Russia-related\nreputation risks and completed\na number of reputation risk\nreviews of matters with a\nRussian nexus.\n\nWhile Citi announced its\nintention to wind down its\nbusinesses in Russia, Citi\nwill continue to manage those\noperations during the wind-\ndown process and will be\nrequired to maintain certain\nlimited operations to fulfill\nits remaining legal and\nregulatory obligations. Also,\nsanctions and sanctions\ncompliance are highly complex\nand may change over time and\nresult in increased\noperational risk. Failure to\nfully comply with relevant\nsanctions or the application\nof sanctions where they should\nnot be applied may negatively\nimpact Citi\u2019s reputation. In\naddition, Citi currently\nperforms services for,\nconducts business with or\ndeals in non-sanctioned\nRussian-owned businesses and\nRussian assets. This has\nattracted, and will likely\ncontinue to attract, negative\nattention, despite the\npreviously disclosed plan to\nwind down nearly all its\nactivities in the country,\ncessation of new business and\nclient originations, and\nreduction of other exposures.\n\nCiti\u2019s continued presence or\ndivestiture of businesses in\nRussia could also increase its\nsusceptibility to cyberattacks\nthat could negatively impact\nits relationships with clients\nand customers, harm its\nreputation, increase its\ncompliance costs and adversely\naffect its business operations\nand results of operations.

In\naddition to receiving regular\nbriefings from management, the\nfull Board has routinely been\ninvited to attend portions of\nthe RMC meetings for\ndiscussions related to the war\nin Ukraine, including with\nrespect to Citi\u2019s risk\nexposures and stress testing.\nThe reports to the Board and\nits Committees from senior\nmanagement who represent the\nimpacted businesses and the\nEMEA region, Independent Risk\nManagement, Finance,\nIndependent Compliance Risk\nManagement, including those\nindividuals responsible for\nsanctions compliance, and\nHuman Resources, have included\ndetailed information regarding\nfinancial impacts, impacts on\ncapital, cybersecurity,\nstrategic considerations,\nsanctions compliance, employee\nassistance and reputational\nrisks, enabling the Board and\nits Committees to properly\nexercise their oversight\nresponsibilities. In addition,\nsenior management has also\nprovided updates to Citi\u2019s\nExecutive Management Team and\nthe Board, outside of formal\nmeetings, regarding Citi\u2019s\nRussia-related risks,\nincluding with respect to\ncybersecurity matters.\n                                                                \n  Ukraine                                                       \n                                                                \nCiti has continued to operate\nin Ukraine throughout the war\nthrough its ICG businesses,\nserving the local subsidiaries\nof multinationals, along with\nlocal financial institutions\nand the public sector. Citi\nemploys approximately 230\npeople in Ukraine and their\nsafety continues to be Citi\u2019s\ntop priority. All of Citi\u2019s\ndomestic operations in Ukraine\nare conducted through a\nsubsidiary of Citibank, which\nuses the Ukrainian hryvnia as\nits functional currency.\nCiti\u2019s exposures in Ukraine\nare not significant enough to\nbe included in the \u201cTop 25\nCountry Exposures\u201d table\nabove. As of June 30, 2023,\nCiti had $1.3 billion of\ndirect exposures related to\nUkraine, compared to $1.2\nbillion as of March 31, 2023.\nThe increase in exposures\nreflected a $0.1 billion\nincrease in deposits.\n                               75                               \n                                                                \n  Argentina                                                     \n                                                                \nCiti operates in Argentina\nthrough its ICG businesses. As\nof June 30, 2023, Citi\u2019s net\ninvestment in its Argentine\noperations was approximately\n$1.9 billion (compared to $1.8\nbillion at March 31, 2023).\nUnder U.S. GAAP, Citi uses the\nU.S. dollar as the functional\ncurrency for its operations in\ncountries such as Argentina\nthat are deemed highly\ninflationary. Citi therefore\nrecords the impact of exchange\nrate fluctuations on its net\nArgentine peso\n(ARS)\u2013denominated assets\ndirectly in earnings.\nAccordingly, Citi seeks to\nreduce its overall ARS\nexposure in Argentina while\ncomplying with local capital\nand currency exposure\nlimitations. As of June 30,\n2023, Citi\u2019s net ARS exposure\nwas approximately $1.6\nbillion, which decreased from\nthe prior quarter as a result\nof Citi purchasing\napproximately $300 million of\ncertain local government bonds\nduring the second quarter that\nare indexed to the higher of\nthe U.S. dollar exchange rate\nor the local inflation index.\nSuch bonds may reduce the\nimpact to Citi of a potential\ncurrency devaluation in the\nfuture, although it remains\nunclear how effective Citi\u2019s\nstrategies to reduce its ARS\nexposure may be.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the\nCentral Bank of Argentina has\ncontinued to maintain certain\ncapital and currency controls\nthat generally restrict Citi\u2019s\nability to access U.S. dollars\nin Argentina and remit\nearnings from its Argentine\noperations. As a result,\nCiti\u2019s net investment in its\nArgentine operations is likely\nto continue to increase as\nCiti generates net income in\nits Argentine franchise and\nits earnings cannot be\nremitted. Due to the currency\ncontrols implemented by the\nCentral Bank of Argentina,\ncertain indirect foreign\nexchange mechanisms have\ndeveloped that some Argentine\nentities may use to obtain\nU.S. dollars, generally at\nrates that are significantly\nhigher than Argentina\u2019s\nofficial exchange rate.\nCitibank Argentina is\nprecluded from accessing these\nalternative mechanisms, and\nthese exchange mechanisms\ncannot be used to remeasure\nCiti\u2019s net monetary assets\ninto the U.S. dollar under\nU.S. GAAP. Citibank Argentina\ntherefore uses Argentina\u2019s\nofficial market exchange rate\nto remeasure its net ARS\nassets into the U.S. dollar,\nwhich was 256.7 ARS to 1 U.S.\ndollar as of June 30, 2023.\nHowever, if Argentina\u2019s\nofficial exchange rate\nconverges with the approximate\nrate implied by the indirect\nforeign exchange mechanisms,\nCiti could incur a significant\nloss on its capital in\nArgentina. Current\nmacroeconomic conditions in\nthe country, along with\nsustained high inflation and\nlow international reserves\nheld by the Central Bank of\nArgentina, may result in an\naccelerated or steep\ndepreciation of the official\nexchange rate in the near\nterm. Citi cannot predict\nfuture fluctuations in\nArgentina\u2019s official market\nexchange rate or to what\nextent Citi may be able to\naccess U.S. dollars at the\nofficial exchange rate in the\nfuture.\n\nCiti may economically hedge\nthe foreign currency risk in\nits net ARS-denominated assets\nto the extent possible and\nprudent using non-deliverable\nforward (NDF) derivative\ninstruments that are primarily\nexecuted outside of Argentina.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the\ninternational NDF market had\nvery limited liquidity,\nresulting in Citi\u2019s inability\nto economically hedge\nsubstantially all of its ARS\nexposure. Accordingly, and to\nthe extent that Citi does not\nexecute NDF contracts for this\nunhedged exposure in the\nfuture, Citi would record\ndevaluations on its net ARS-\ndenominated assets in\nearnings, without any benefit\nfrom a change in the fair\nvalue of derivative positions\nused to economically hedge the\nexposure.\n\nCiti continually evaluates its\neconomic exposure to its\nArgentine counterparties and\nreserves for changes in credit\nrisk and records mark-to-\nmarket adjustments for\nrelevant market risks\nassociated with its Argentine\nassets. Citi believes it has\nestablished an appropriate ACL\non its Argentine loans, and\nappropriate fair value\nadjustments on Argentine\nassets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value, for\ncredit and sovereign risks\nunder U.S. GAAP as of June 30,\n2023. However, Citi may need\nto record additional reserves\nin the future, resulting in\nhigher ICG cost of credit,\nshould there be an increase in\ntransfer risk associated with\nits Argentine exposures. For\nadditional information on\nCiti\u2019s emerging markets risks,\nincluding those related to its\nArgentine exposures, see \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Strategic Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n                               76                               \nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT\nESTIMATES\n\nThis section contains a\nsummary of Citi\u2019s most\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K contains a summary of all\nof Citigroup\u2019s significant\naccounting policies. These\npolicies, as well as estimates\nmade by management, are\nintegral to the presentation\nof Citi\u2019s results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. While all of these\npolicies require a certain\nlevel of management judgment\nand estimates, this section\nhighlights and discusses the\nsignificant accounting\npolicies that require\nmanagement to make highly\ndifficult, complex or\nsubjective judgments and\nestimates at times regarding\nmatters that are inherently\nuncertain and susceptible to\nchange (see also \u201cRisk\nFactors\u2014Operational Risks\u201d in\nCiti\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K).\nManagement has discussed each\nof these significant\naccounting policies, the\nrelated estimates and its\njudgments with the Audit\nCommittee of the Citigroup\nBoard of Directors.\n                                                                \n  Valuations of Financial Instruments                           \n                                                                \nCitigroup holds debt and\nequity securities,\nderivatives, retained\ninterests in securitizations,\ninvestments in private equity\nand other financial\ninstruments. A substantial\nportion of these assets and\nliabilities is reflected at\nfair value on Citi\u2019s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as\nTrading account assets ,\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nand Trading account\nliabilities .\n\nCiti purchases securities\nunder agreements to resell\n(reverse repos or resale\nagreements) and sells\nsecurities under agreements to\nrepurchase (repos), a\nsubstantial portion of which\nis carried at fair value. In\naddition, certain loans,\nshort-term borrowings, long-\nterm debt and deposits, as\nwell as certain securities\nborrowed and loaned positions\nthat are collateralized with\ncash, are carried at fair\nvalue. Citigroup holds its\ninvestments, trading assets\nand liabilities, and resale\nand repurchase agreements on\nCiti\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet to meet customer needs\nand to manage liquidity needs,\ninterest rate risks and\nprivate equity investing.\n\nWhen available, Citi generally\nuses quoted market prices to\ndetermine fair value and\nclassifies such items within\nLevel 1 of the fair value\nhierarchy established under\nASC 820-10, Fair Value\nMeasurement . If quoted market\nprices are not available, fair\nvalue is based on internally\ndeveloped valuation models\nthat use, where possible,\ncurrent market-based or\nindependently sourced market\nparameters, such as interest\nrates, currency rates and\noption volatilities. Such\nmodels are often based on a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis.\nIn addition, items valued\nusing such internally\ngenerated valuation techniques\nare classified according to\nthe lowest level input or\nvalue driver that is\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThus, an item may be\nclassified under the fair\nvalue hierarchy as Level 3\neven though there may be some\nsignificant inputs that are\nreadily observable.\n\nCiti is required to exercise\nsubjective judgments relating\nto the applicability and\nfunctionality of internal\nvaluation models, the\nsignificance of inputs or\nvalue drivers to the valuation\nof an instrument and the\ndegree of illiquidity and\nsubsequent lack of\nobservability in certain\nmarkets. The fair value of\nthese instruments is reported\non Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet with the changes in fair\nvalue recognized in either the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome or in AOCI .\n\nLosses on available-for-sale\nsecurities whose fair values\nare less than the amortized\ncost, where Citi intends to\nsell the security or could\nmore-likely-than-not be\nrequired to sell the security\nprior to recovery, are\nrecognized in earnings. Where\nCiti does not intend to sell\nthe security nor could more-\nlikely-than-not be required to\nsell the security, any portion\nof the loss that is\nattributable to credit is\nrecognized as an allowance for\ncredit losses with a\ncorresponding provision for\ncredit losses and the\nremainder of the loss is\nrecognized in AOCI . Such\nlosses are capped at the\ndifference between the fair\nvalue and amortized cost of\nthe security.\n\nFor equity securities carried\nat cost or under the\nmeasurement alternative,\ndecreases in fair value below\nthe carrying value are\nrecognized as impairment in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome. Moreover, for certain\nequity method investments,\ndecreases in fair value are\nonly recognized in earnings in\nthe Consolidated Statement of\nIncome if such decreases are\njudged to be an other-than-\ntemporary impairment (OTTI).\nAssessing if the fair value\nimpairment is temporary is\nalso inherently judgmental.\n\nThe fair value of financial\ninstruments incorporates the\neffects of Citi\u2019s own credit\nrisk and the market view of\ncounterparty credit risk, the\nquantification of which is\nalso complex and judgmental.\nFor additional information on\nCiti\u2019s fair value analysis,\nsee Notes 6, 22 and 23 in this\nForm 10-Q and Note 1 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K.\n                               77                               \n                                                                \n  Citi\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)                      \n                                                                \nThe table below presents\nCiti\u2019s allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\ntotal ACL as of the second\nquarter of 2023.

See Notes 1 and 14.\n\nCiti\u2019s reserves for expected\ncredit losses on funded loans\nand for unfunded lending\ncommitments, standby letters\nof credit and financial\nguarantees are reflected on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet\nin the Allowance for credit\nlosses on loans (ACLL) and\nOther liabilities (for\nAllowance for credit losses on\nunfunded lending commitments\n(ACLUC)), respectively. In\naddition, Citi\u2019s reserves for\nexpected credit losses on\nother financial assets carried\nat amortized cost, including\nheld-to-maturity securities,\nreverse repurchase agreements,\nsecurities borrowed, deposits\nwith banks and other financial\nreceivables are reflected in\nOther assets . These reserves,\ntogether with the ACLL and\nACLUC, are referred to as the\nACL. Changes in the ACL are\nreflected as Provision for\ncredit losses in the\nConsolidated Statement of\nIncome for each reporting\nperiod. Citi\u2019s ability to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses over the reasonable and\nsupportable (R&S) period is\nbased on the ability to\nforecast economic activity\nover an R&S timeframe. The R&S\nforecast period for consumer\nand corporate credit exposures\nis eight quarters.\n\nThe ACL is composed of\nquantitative and qualitative\nmanagement adjustment\ncomponents. The quantitative\ncomponent uses three forward-\nlooking macroeconomic forecast\nscenarios\u2014base, upside and\ndownside. The\n\nqualitative management\nadjustment component reflects\nrisks and current economic\nconditions not fully captured\nin the quantitative component.\nBoth the quantitative and\nqualitative components are\nfurther discussed below.\n                                                                \n  Quantitative Component                                        \n                                                                \nCiti estimates expected credit\nlosses for its quantitative\ncomponent using (i) its\ncomprehensive internal data on\nloss and default history, (ii)\ninternal credit risk ratings,\n(iii) external credit bureau\nand rating agencies\ninformation and (iv) R&S\nforecasts of macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nFor its consumer and corporate\nportfolios, Citi\u2019s expected\ncredit losses are determined\nprimarily by utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default (PD),\nloss given default (LGD) and\nexposure at default (EAD). The\nloss likelihood and severity\nmodels used for estimating\nexpected credit losses are\nsensitive to changes in\nmacroeconomic variables,\nincluding housing prices,\nunemployment rate and real\nGDP, and cover a wide range of\ngeographic, industry, product\nand business segments.\n\nIn addition, Citi\u2019s models\ndetermine expected credit\nlosses based on leading credit\nindicators, including loan\ndelinquencies, changes in\nportfolio size, default\nfrequency,\n                               78                               \nrisk ratings and loss recovery\nrates, as well as other credit\ntrends. Qualitative Component\nThe qualitative management\nadjustment component includes,\namong other things, risks that\nare not fully captured in the\nquantitative component. These\nmay include but are not\nlimited to portfolio\ncharacteristics, idiosyncratic\nevents, factors not within\nhistorical loss data or the\neconomic forecast, uncertainty\nin the environment and other\nfactors as required by banking\nsupervisory guidance for the\nACL. The primary examples of\nthese are: \u2022 Expected\nnormalization of portfolio\nperformance and consumer\nbehavior from recent low\nlosses as a result of\ngovernment stimulus and market\nliquidity during the COVID-19\npandemic \u2022 Potential impacts\non vulnerable industries and\nregions due to emerging\nmacroeconomic risks and\nuncertainties, including those\nrelated to potential global\nrecession, inflation, interest\nrates, commodity prices and\ngeopolitical tensions \u2022\nTransfer risk associated with\nexposures outside the U.S. for\ncertain safety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law Citi\u2019s qualitative\ncomponent of the ACL continued\nto decline quarter-over-\nquarter. The decline was\nprimarily driven by releases\nof COVID-19\u2013related\nuncertainty reserves as the\nportfolio continues to\nnormalize toward pre-pandemic\nlevels and as these risks are\ncaptured in the quantitative\ncomponent of the ACL. These\nreleases were partially offset\nby a build for transfer risk\nassociated with exposures\noutside the U.S. driven by\nsafety and soundness\nconsiderations under U.S.\nbanking law. Macroeconomic\nVariables Citi considers a\nmultitude of global\nmacroeconomic variables for\nthe base, upside and downside\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\nforecasts it uses to estimate\nthe ACL. Citi\u2019s forecasts of\nthe U.S. unemployment rate and\nU.S. real GDP growth rate\nrepresent the key\nmacroeconomic variables that\nmost significantly affect its\nestimate of the ACL.

Under the\nbase macroeconomic forecast as\nof 2Q23, U.S. real GDP growth\nis expected to decline for the\nremainder of 2023, while the\nunemployment rate is expected\nto increase modestly over the\neight-quarter forecast\nhorizon, broadly returning to\npre-pandemic levels. Scenario\nWeighting Citi\u2019s ACL is\nestimated using three\nprobability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenarios\u2014base,\nupside and downside. The\nmacroeconomic scenario weights\nare estimated using a\nstatistical model, which,\namong other factors, takes\ninto consideration key\nmacroeconomic drivers of the\nACL, severity of the scenario\nand other macroeconomic\nuncertainties and risks. Citi\nevaluates scenario weights on\na quarterly basis. Citi\u2019s\ndownside scenario incorporates\nmore adverse macroeconomic\nassumptions than the base\nscenario. For example,\ncompared to the base scenario,\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nreflects a more severe\nrecession, including an\nelevated average U.S.\nunemployment rate of 6.8% over\nthe eight-quarter R&S period,\nwith a peak difference of 3.0%\nin the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe downside scenario also\nreflects a year-over-year U.S.\nreal GDP contraction in 2024\nof 1.9%, with a peak quarter-\nover-quarter difference to the\nbase scenario of 1.0% in the\nfourth quarter of 2023. Citi\u2019s\nACL is sensitive to the\nvarious macroeconomic\nscenarios that drive the\nquantitative component of\nexpected credit losses due to\nchanges in the length and\nseverity of forecasted\neconomic variables or events\nin the respective scenarios.\nTo demonstrate this\nsensitivity, Citi applied 100%\nweight to the downside\nscenario as of June 30, 2023,\nto reflect the most severe\neconomic deterioration\nforecast in the multiple\nmacroeconomic scenarios.\nCiti\u2019s downside scenario\nincorporates more adverse\nmacroeconomic assumptions than\nthe weighted scenario\nassumptions; therefore,\napplying a 100% downside\nscenario weight would result\nin a hypothetical increase in\nthe ACL of approximately $4.5\nbillion related to lending\nexposures, except for loans\nindividually evaluated for\ncredit losses. This analysis\ndoes not incorporate any\nimpacts or changes to the\nqualitative component of the\nACL. These factors could\ndecrease the outcome of the\nsensitivity analysis based on\nhistorical experience and\ncurrent conditions at the time\nof the assessment. Given the\nuncertainty inherent in\nmacroeconomic forecasting,\nCiti continues to believe that\nits ACL estimate based on a\nthree probability-weighted\nmacroeconomic scenario\napproach combined with the\nqualitative component remains\nappropriate as of June 30,\n2023.\n                               79                               \n2Q23 Changes in the ACL\n\nAs further discussed below,\nCiti\u2019s ending ACL balance for\nthe second quarter of 2023 was\n$20.1 billion, compared to\n$19.8 billion as of March 31,\n2023. The net build of $0.3\nbillion was primarily driven\nby growth in card balances in\nPBWM , partially offset by a\nrelease in the corporate\nportfolios due to an improved\nmacroeconomic outlook. Based\non its latest macroeconomic\nforecast, Citi believes its\nanalysis of the ACL reflects\nthe forward view of the\neconomic environment as of\nJune 30, 2023. See Note 14 for\nadditional information.\n\nConsumer Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti\u2019s consumer ACLL is\nlargely driven by U.S. cards\n(Branded cards and Retail\nservices) in U.S. Personal\nBanking. Citi\u2019s total consumer\nACLL build was $0.4 billion in\nthe second quarter of 2023,\nprimarily driven by growth in\nU.S. cards balances, resulting\nin a June 30, 2023 ACLL\nbalance of $14.9 billion, or\n3.97% of total funded consumer\nloans.\n\nFor U.S. cards, the level of\nreserves relative to total\nfunded loans decreased to\n7.86% at June 30, 2023, due to\nvolume growth in lower-loss\nportfolios, compared to 8.08%\nat March 31, 2023. For the\nremaining consumer exposures,\nthe level of reserves relative\nto total funded loans was\n1.28% at June 30, 2023,\ncompared to 1.21% at March 31,\n2023.\n\nCorporate Allowance for Credit\nLosses on Loans\n\nCiti had a corporate ACLL\nrelease of $0.2 billion in the\nsecond quarter of 2023. The\nrelease was primarily driven\nby an improved macroeconomic\noutlook. The ACLL reserve\nbalance decreased by $0.2\nbillion to $2.6 billion, or\n0.94% of total funded\ncorporate loans.\n                                                                \n  ACLUC                                                         \n                                                                \nCiti had an ACLUC release of\n$0.1 billion in the second\nquarter of 2023, which reduced\nthe ACLUC reserve balance,\nincluded in Other liabilities\n, to $1.9 billion.

The\nincrease for the second quarter and year to date was primarily a\nresult of Citi\u2019s geographic mix of earnings. Of Citi\u2019s $28.5\nbillion of net DTAs, $16.8 billion was not deducted in\ncalculating regulatory capital and was appropriately risk\nweighted under the Basel III rules. The remaining $11.7 billion\n(compared to $11.1 billion at March 31, 2023) was deducted in\ncalculating Citi\u2019s regulatory capital.\n\nThe $11.7 billion of DTA deducted from regulatory capital was\ncomposed of $11.5 billion related to tax carry-forwards and $1.8\nbillion of temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15%\nregulatory limitations, reduced by $1.6 billion of deferred tax\nliabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain\nother intangible assets that were separately deducted from\ncapital. The largest component of the increase in the DTA\ndeducted from Citi\u2019s regulatory capital during the quarter was\nrelated to temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15%\nlimitations ($1.8 billion at June 30, 2023 compared to $1.1\nbillion at March 31, 2023), primarily attributable to higher\ntemporary differences in DTAs subject to the limitation. DTA\nRealizability Citi believes that realization of the net DTAs of\n$28.5 billion at June 30, 2023 is more-likely-than-not, based on\nmanagement\u2019s expectations of future taxable income generation in\nthe jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as\nconsideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined\nin ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ).\n                               81                               \n                                                                \n  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES                            \n                                                                \nCiti\u2019s disclosure controls and\nprocedures are designed to\nensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and\nreported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, including\nwithout limitation that\ninformation required to be\ndisclosed by Citi in its SEC\nfilings is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management,\nincluding the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (CFO), as\nappropriate, to allow for\ntimely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n\nCiti\u2019s Disclosure Committee\nassists the CEO and CFO in\ntheir responsibilities to\ndesign, establish, maintain\nand evaluate the effectiveness\nof Citi\u2019s disclosure controls\nand procedures. The Disclosure\nCommittee is responsible for,\namong other things, the\noversight, maintenance and\nimplementation of the\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures, subject to the\nsupervision and oversight of\nthe CEO and CFO.\n\nCiti\u2019s management, with the\nparticipation of its CEO and\nCFO, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of Citigroup\u2019s\ndisclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934) as of\nJune 30, 2023.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION,\nUPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAND ACCOUNTING CHANGES\n\nBasis of Presentation The\naccompanying unaudited\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements as of June 30, 2023\nand for the three- and six-\nmonth periods ended June 30,\n2023 and 2022 include the\naccounts of Citigroup Inc. and\nits consolidated subsidiaries.\nIn the opinion of management,\nall adjustments, consisting of\nnormal recurring adjustments,\nnecessary for a fair\npresentation have been\nreflected. The accompanying\nunaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements and related notes\nincluded within Citigroup\u2019s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31,\n2022 (2022 Form 10-K) and\nCitigroup\u2019s Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended March 31, 2023 (First\nQuarter of 2023 Form 10-Q).\nCertain financial information\nthat is normally included in\nannual financial statements\nprepared in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP),\nbut is not required for\ninterim reporting purposes,\nhas been condensed or omitted.\nManagement must make estimates\nand assumptions that affect\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the related\nfootnote disclosures. While\nmanagement uses its best\njudgment, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nAs noted above, the Notes to\nthese Consolidated Financial\nStatements are unaudited.\nThroughout these Notes,\n\u201cCitigroup,\u201d \u201cCiti\u201d and \u201cthe\nCompany\u201d refer to Citigroup\nInc. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Certain\nreclassifications and updates\nhave been made to the prior\nperiods\u2019 financial statements\nand notes to conform to the\ncurrent period\u2019s presentation.\nCash equivalents are defined\nas those amounts included in\nCash and due from banks and\npredominately all of Deposits\nwith banks . Cash flows from\nrisk management activities are\nclassified in the same\ncategory as the related assets\nand liabilities. Amounts\nincluded in Cash and due from\nbanks and Deposits with banks\napproximate fair value.\n\nUPDATED SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES The accounting\npolicies below have been\nupdated from those disclosed\nin Citi\u2019s 2022 Annual Report\non Form 10-K (2022 Form 10-K)\nas a result of accounting\nstandards adopted during the\nfirst quarter of 2023. See\nNote 1 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K for a summary\nof all of Citigroup\u2019s\nsignificant accounting\npolicies. Allowances for\nCredit Losses (ACL) Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi adopted\nAccounting Standards Update\n(ASU) No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures under the\nmethodology described below.\nFor information about Citi\u2019s\naccounting for troubled debt\nrestructurings (TDRs) prior to\nJanuary 1, 2023, see Note 1 to\nthe Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. ACCOUNTING CHANGES TDRs\nand Vintage Disclosures In\nMarch 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments\u2014Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures . Citi adopted the\nASU on January 1, 2023. Citi\nadopted the guidance on the\nrecognition and measurement of\nTDRs under the modified\nretrospective approach.\nAdopting these amendments\nresulted in a decrease to the\nACLL of $ 352million and an\nincrease in other assets\nrelated to held-for-sale\nbusinesses of $ 44million,\nwith a corresponding increase\nto retained earnings of $\n290million and a decrease in\ndeferred tax assets of $\n106million on January 1, 2023.\nThe ACL for corporate loans\nwas unaffected because the\nmeasurement approach used for\ncorporate loans is not in the\nscope of this ASU. ASU 2022-02\neliminates the accounting and\ndisclosure requirements for\nTDRs, including the\nrequirement to measure the\nACLL for TDRs using a\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF)\napproach. With the elimination\nof TDR accounting\nrequirements, reasonably\nexpected TDRs are no longer\nconsidered when determining\nthe term over which to\nestimate expected credit\nlosses. The ACLL for modified\nloans that are collateral\ndependent continues to be\nbased on the fair value of the\ncollateral. Consumer Loans\nUpon adoption of the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2023, Citi\ndiscontinued the use of a DCF\napproach for consumer loans\nformerly considered TDRs.\nBeginning January 1, 2023,\nCiti measures the ACLL for all\nconsumer loans under\napproaches that do not\nincorporate discounting,\nprimarily utilizing models\nthat consider the borrowers\u2019\nprobability of default, loss\ngiven default and exposure at\ndefault. In addition, upon\nadoption of the ASU, Citi\ncollectively evaluates\nsmaller-balance homogenous\nloans formerly considered TDRs\nfor expected\n                               95                               \ncredit losses, whereas\npreviously those loans had\nbeen individually evaluated.\nThe ASU also requires\ndisclosure of modifications of\nloans to borrowers\nexperiencing financial\ndifficulty if the modification\ninvolves principal\nforgiveness, an interest rate\nreduction, an other-than-\ninsignificant payment delay, a\nterm extension or a\ncombination of those types of\nmodifications. In addition,\nthe ASU requires the\ndisclosure of current-period\ngross write-offs by year of\nloan origination (vintage).\nThe amendments related to\ndisclosures are required to be\napplied prospectively\nbeginning as of the date of\nadoption. See Note 13 for\nthese new disclosures for\nperiods beginning on and after\nJanuary 1, 2023. Long-Duration\nInsurance Contracts In August\n2018, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2018-12, Financial\nServices\u2014Insurance: Targeted\nImprovements to the Accounting\nfor Long-Duration Contracts ,\nwhich changes the existing\nrecognition, measurement,\npresentation and disclosures\nfor long-duration contracts\nissued by an insurance entity.\nSpecifically, the guidance (i)\nimproves the timeliness of\nrecognizing changes in the\nliability for future policy\nbenefits and prescribes the\nrate used to discount future\ncash flows for long-duration\ninsurance contracts, (ii)\nsimplifies and improves the\naccounting for certain market-\nbased options or guarantees\nassociated with deposit (or\naccount balance) contracts,\n(iii) simplifies the\namortization of deferred\nacquisition costs and (iv)\nintroduces additional\nquantitative and qualitative\ndisclosures. Citi has certain\ninsurance subsidiaries,\nprimarily in Mexico, that\nissue long-duration insurance\ncontracts such as traditional\nlife insurance policies and\nlife-contingent annuity\ncontracts that are impacted by\nthe requirements of ASU\n2018-12. Citi adopted the\ntargeted improvements in ASU\n2018-12 on January 1, 2023,\nresulting in a $ 39million\ndecrease in Other liabilities\nand a $ 27million increase in\nAOCI , after-tax.\n\nFUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES\nAccounting for Investments in\nTax Credit Structures In March\n2023, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2023\u201002, Investments\u2014Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures\n(Topic 323): Accounting for\nInvestments in Tax Credit\nStructures Using the\nProportional Amortization\nMethod . The ASU expands the\nscope of tax equity\ninvestments eligible to apply\nthe proportional amortization\nmethod of accounting. Under\nthe proportional amortization\nmethod, the cost of an\neligible investment is\namortized in proportion to the\nincome tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits that are\nreceived by the investor, with\nthe amortization of the\ninvestment and the income tax\ncredits being presented net in\nthe income statement as\ncomponents of income tax\nexpense (benefit). Prior to\nthe issuance of this ASU, use\nof the proportional\namortization method was\nlimited to tax equity\ninvestments in Low\u2010Income\nHousing Tax Credit (LIHTC)\nstructures, and all other tax\nequity investments were\ntypically accounted for using\nthe equity method of\naccounting, which resulted in\ninvestment income, gains and\nlosses, and tax credits being\npresented gross on the income\nstatement in their respective\nline items. The ASU will\npermit the Company to elect to\nuse the proportional\namortization method to account\nfor all eligible tax equity\ninvestments, regardless of the\ntax credit program from which\nthe income tax credits are\nreceived, if certain\nconditions are met. For public\nentities, the ASU is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023,\nalthough early adoption is\npermitted in any interim\nperiod. However, if an entity\nadopts the amendments in an\ninterim period, it shall adopt\nthem as of the beginning of\nthe fiscal year that includes\nthat interim period. Adoption\nof the ASU must be applied on\neither a retrospective or a\nmodified retrospective basis.\nCiti plans to adopt the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2024 and is\ncurrently evaluating the\nimpact of the standard on tax\nequity investments. Citi does\nnot expect a material impact\nto its results of operations\nas a result of adopting the\nstandard. Fair Value\nMeasurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued\nASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value\nMeasurement (Topic 820): Fair\nValue Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to\nContractual Sale Restrictions\n. The ASU was issued to\naddress diversity in practice\nwhereby certain entities\nincluded the impact of\ncontractual restrictions when\nvaluing equity securities, and\nit clarifies that a\ncontractual restriction on the\nsale of an equity security\nshould not be considered part\nof the unit of account of the\nequity security and,\ntherefore, should not be\nconsidered in measuring fair\nvalue. The ASU also includes\nrequirements for entities to\ndisclose the fair value of\nequity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions,\nthe nature and remaining\nduration of the restrictions\nand the circumstances that\ncould cause a lapse in the\nrestrictions.\n\nThe ASU is to be adopted on a\nprospective basis and will be\neffective for Citi on January\n1, 2024, although early\nadoption is permitted.\nAdoption of the accounting\nstandard is not expected to\nhave an impact on Citi\u2019s\noperating results or financial\nposition, as the Company does\nnot include such restrictions\nwhen valuing equity\nsecurities.\n                               96                               \n2.

As a result, a CTA\nloss (net of hedges) in AOCI\nof approximately $ 400million\npretax ($ 345million after-\ntax) related to the legacy\noperation was released to\nearnings in the second quarter\nof 2022.

As part of the wind-down, Citi is also\nactively pursuing sales of certain Russian consumer banking\nportfolios. On October 14, 2022, Citi disclosed that it will be\nending nearly all of the institutional banking services it\noffers in Russia by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Going\nforward, Citi\u2019s only operations in Russia will be those\nnecessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory\nobligations. On December 12, 2022, Citi completed the sale of a\nportfolio of ruble-denominated personal installment loans,\ntotaling approximately $ 240million in outstanding loan\nbalances, to Uralsib, a Russian commercial bank, resulting in a\npretax net loss of approximately $ 12million. The net loss on\nsale of the loan portfolio included a $ 32million adjustment to\nrecord the loans at lower of cost or fair value recognized in\nOther revenue. In addition, the sale of the loans resulted in a\nrelease in the allowance for credit losses on loans of\napproximately $ 20million recognized in the Provision for credit\nlosses on loans . During the second quarter of 2023, Citi\nrecorded an incremental gain of $ 5million related to post-\nclosing contingency payments for the previously disclosed\npersonal installment loan sale in Other revenue. The previously\ndisclosed sale of a portfolio of ruble-denominated personal\ninstallment loans resulted in a pretax net loss on sale of\napproximately $ 7million. Citi\u2019s previously disclosed referral\nagreement with a Russian bank to settle a portfolio of ruble-\ndenominated credit card loans, subject to customer consents, was\nsigned in May 2023 and is in the execution phase. The\noutstanding amount with Citi is to be settled upon referral and\nrefinancing. As a result, the portfolio will remain held-for-\ninvestment and will not be transferred to held-for-sale. During\nthe second quarter of 2023, Citi recorded a pretax release of\napproximately $ 1million and a pretax charge of approximately $\n2million (approximately $ 29million and $ 12million program-to-\ndate) as Compensation and benefits composed of severance costs,\nreported in Legacy Franchises and Institutional Clients Group ,\nrespectively. Citi also recorded a pretax charge of\napproximately $ 4million (approximately $ 17million program-to-\ndate) as Other operating expenses composed of vendor termination\nand other costs, reported in Legacy Franchises . In connection\nwith this wind-down, Citi expects to incur approximately $\n180million in total estimated charges ($ 40million in ICG and $\n140million in Legacy Franchises , excluding the impact from any\nportfolio sales), of which approximately $ 58million has been\nincurred program-to-date, largely driven by restructuring,\nvendor termination fees and other related charges.\n                               99                               \n                                                                \n  3.

These agreements are\nsubject to contractually based performance thresholds that, if\nmet, would require Citi to make ongoing payments to the partner.\nThe threshold is based on the profitability of a program and is\ngenerally calculated based on predefined program revenues less\npredefined program expenses. In most of Citi\u2019s partner sharing\nagreements, program expenses include net credit losses and, to\nthe extent that an increase in net credit losses reduces Citi\u2019s\nliability for the partners\u2019 share for a given program year,\nwould generally result in lower payments to partners in total\nfor that year and vice versa.

funding rules as of January 1, 2023 and no\nminimum required funding is expected for 2023.\n(2) The nonqualified plans of the Company are unfunded.\n(3) The framework for the Company\u2019s pension oversight process\nincludes monitoring of potential settlement charges for all\nplans. Settlement accounting is triggered when either the sum of\nall settlements (including lump-sum payments) for the year is\ngreater than service plus interest costs or if more than 10% of\nthe plan\u2019s projected benefit obligation will be settled. Because\nsome of Citi\u2019s significant plans are frozen and have no material\nservice cost, settlement accounting may apply in the future.\n                              107

For resale and repurchase\nagreements, when necessary, the Company posts additional\ncollateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection. A\nsubstantial portion of the resale and repurchase agreements is\nrecorded at fair value as the Company elected the fair value\noption, as described in Notes 22 and 23. The remaining portion\nis carried at the amount of cash initially advanced or received,\nplus accrued interest, as specified in the respective\nagreements. A substantial portion of securities borrowing and\nlending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or\nreceived. The remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the\nCompany elected the fair value option for certain securities\nborrowed and loaned portfolios, as described in Note 23. With\nrespect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash\ncollateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value\nof the securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value\nof securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis\nand posts or obtains additional collateral in order to maintain\ncontractual margin protection. The following tables present the\ngross and net resale and repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing and lending agreements and the related offsetting\namounts permitted under ASC 210-20-45. The tables also include\namounts related to financial instruments that are not permitted\nto be offset under ASC 210-20-45, but would be eligible for\noffsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred\nand a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the offsetting\nrights has been obtained. Remaining exposures continue to be\nsecured by financial collateral, but the Company may not have\nsought or been able to obtain a legal opinion evidencing\nenforceability of the offsetting right.\n

invests in mortgage- and asset-backed\nsecurities, which are typically issued by VIEs through\nsecuritization transactions. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to\nloss from these VIEs is equal to the carrying amount of the\nsecurities, which is reflected in the table above. See Note 20\nfor mortgage- and asset-backed securitizations in which the\nCompany has other involvement.\n(2) In January 2023, Citi adopted ASU 2022-01. Upon adoption,\nCiti transferred $ 3.3billion of mortgage-backed securities from\nHTM classification to AFS classification as allowed under the\nASU. At the time of transfer, the securities were in an\nunrealized gain position of $ 0.1billion, which was recorded in\nAOCI upon transfer . See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K.\n(3) Amortized cost includes unallocated portfolio layer\ncumulative basis adjustments of $( 0.2) billion as of June 30,\n2023. Gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses on\nmortgage-backed securities excluding the effect of unallocated\nportfolio layer cumulative basis adjustments were $ 32million\nand $ 848million, respectively, as of June 30, 2023.\n                              116                               \nThe following table presents the fair value of AFS debt\nsecurities that have been in an

equity\nsecurities are required to be\nmeasured at fair value with\nchanges in fair value\nrecognized in earnings unless\n(i) the measurement\nalternative is elected or (ii)\nthe investment represents\nFederal Reserve Bank and\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock\nor certain exchange seats that\ncontinue to be carried at\ncost.\n\nThe election to measure a non-\nmarketable equity security\nusing the measurement\nalternative is made on an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. Under the measurement\nalternative, an equity\nsecurity is carried at cost\nplus or minus changes\nresulting from observable\nprices in orderly transactions\nfor the identical or a similar\ninvestment of the same issuer.\nThe carrying value of the\nequity security is adjusted to\nfair value on the date of an\nobserved transaction. Fair\nvalue may differ from the\nobserved transaction price due\nto a number of factors,\nincluding marketability\nadjustments and differences in\nrights and obligations when\nthe observed transaction is\nnot for the identical\ninvestment held by Citi.\n\nEquity securities under the\nmeasurement alternative are\nalso assessed for impairment.\nOn a quarterly basis,\nmanagement qualitatively\nassesses whether each equity\nsecurity under the measurement\nalternative is impaired. For\ndetails on impairment\nindicators that are\nconsidered, see Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K.\n\nWhen the qualitative\nassessment indicates that the\nequity security is impaired,\nits fair value is determined.\nIf the fair value of the\ninvestment is less than its\ncarrying value, the investment\nis written down to fair value\nthrough earnings.\nBelow is the carrying value of\nnon-marketable equity\nsecurities measured using the\nmeasurement alternative at\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022 :\n                                                                \n  In millions of                                  December 31,  \n  dollars                     June 30, 2023               2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement                                                   \n  alternative:                                                  \n  Carrying value           $          1,618    $         1,676  \n                                                                \nBelow are amounts recognized\nin earnings and life-to-date\namounts for non-marketable\nequity securities measured\nusing the measurement\nalternative:\n                                                                \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026           Three                       Six             \n  of               Months                    Months             \n  dollars           Ended                     Ended             \n  Measur\u2026        June 30,                  June 30,             \n  altern\u2026            2023       2022           2023       2022  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Impair\u2026    $         28    $     6    $        63    $     6  \n  losses                                                        \n  Downwa\u2026                                                       \n  changes                                                       \n  for                   \u2014          \u2014             20          \u2014  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n  Upward                                                        \n  changes                                                       \n  for                   3         48             33        134  \n  observ\u2026                                                       \n  prices                                                        \n                                                                \n(1) See Note 22 for additional\ninformation on these\nnonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements.\n                                                                \n                                       Life-to-date amounts on  \n                                         securities still held  \n  In millions of dollars                         June 30, 2023  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Measurement alternative:                                      \n  Impairment losses             $                          282  \n  Downward changes for                                      26  \n  observable prices                                             \n  Upward changes for                                       900  \n  observable prices                                             \n                                                                \nA similar impairment analysis\nis performed for non-\nmarketable equity securities\ncarried at cost.

past due are generally\nclassified as non-accrual. Corporate loans are considered past\ndue when principal or interest is contractually due but unpaid.\n(2) Non-accrual loans generally include those loans that are 90\ndays or more past due or those loans for which Citi believes,\nbased on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of\nthe collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of\ninterest and/or principal is doubtful.\n(3) Loans less than 30 days past due are presented as current.\n(4) The Total loans column includes loans at fair value, which\nare not included in the various delinquency columns, and\ntherefore the

difficulty to reduce Citi\u2019s exposure to\nloss, often providing the borrower with an opportunity to work\nthrough financial difficulties. Each modification is unique to\nthe borrower\u2019s individual circumstances. The following table\ndetails corporate loan modifications granted during the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2023 to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty by type of modification granted and the\nfinancial effect of those modifications. Citi defines a\ncorporate loan modification to a borrower experiencing financial\ndifficulty as a modification of a loan classified as substandard\nor worse at the time of modification.\n                                                                \n              For the                                           \n                Three                                           \n              and Six                                           \n               Months                                           \n  In            Ended                                           \n  mill\u2026          June                                           \n  of              30,                                           \n  doll\u2026          2023                                           \n  exce\u2026         Total                    Combin\u2026                \n  for         modifi\u2026                       Term    Weigh\u2026      \n  weig\u2026       balance                    extens\u2026    avera\u2026      \n  aver\u2026       at June                        and    term        \n  term            30,         Term       payment    exten\u2026      \n  exte\u2026       2023(1\u2026       exten\u2026       delay(\u2026    (mont\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Three                                                         \n  Mont\u2026                                                         \n  Ended                                                         \n  June                                                          \n  30,                                                           \n  2023                                                          \n  Comm\u2026                                                         \n  and      $       66    $      65    $        1            22  \n  indu\u2026                                                         \n  Fina\u2026             \u2014            \u2014             \u2014    \u2014           \n  inst\u2026                                                         \n  Mort\u2026                                                         \n  and              47           46             1            24  \n  real                                                          \n  esta\u2026                                                         \n  Othe\u2026             \u2014            \u2014             \u2014    \u2014           \n  Total    $      113    $     111    $        2                \n  Six                                                           \n  Mont\u2026                                                         \n  Ended                                                         \n  June                                                          \n  30,                                                           \n  2023                                                          \n  Comm\u2026                                                         \n  and      $      121    $      95    $       26            21  \n  indu\u2026                                                         \n  Fina\u2026             \u2014            \u2014             \u2014    \u2014           \n  inst\u2026                                                         \n  Mort\u2026                                                         \n  and              49           48             1            23  \n  real                                                          \n  esta\u2026                                                         \n  Othe\u2026             \u2014            \u2014             \u2014    \u2014           \n  Total    $      170    $     143    $       27                \n                                                                \n(1) The above table reflects activity for loans outstanding as\nof the end of the reporting period.

Citi uses various\nmetrics to identify consumer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, with the primary indicator being delinquency at the\ntime of modification. Citi\u2019s significant consumer modification\nprograms are described below. Credit Cards Citi seeks to assist\ncredit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty\nby offering long-term loan modification programs. These\nmodifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on\nthe credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan\nnot to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer\u2019s available\nline of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card\nborrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that\nseek to restructure customers\u2019 entire unsecured debt. In both\ncircumstances, if the cardholder does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age\nand will ultimately be charged off in accordance with Citi\u2019s\nstandard charge-off policy. In certain situations, Citi may\nforgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays\na required amount. Residential Mortgages Citi seeks to assist\nresidential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial\ndifficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions,\nprincipal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or\ncombinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs\ntypically have payments suspended until the end of the\nforbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently modifying\nthe contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi enters\ninto a trial modification with the borrower. Trial modifications\ngenerally represent a three-monthperiod during which the\nborrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified\npayment terms. These loans continue to age and accrue interest\nin accordance with their original contractual terms. Upon\nsuccessful completion of the trial period, and the borrower\u2019s\nformal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower\nenter into a permanent modification.

significant, regardless of the likelihood of\nloss.\n(4) Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and\nnon-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These\nSPEs are not consolidated.\n(5) Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored\nprivate equity funds, which represent $ 11billion and $\n69billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $ 534million and $\n498million in maximum exposure to loss as of June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\n                              160                               \nThe previous tables do not include: \u2022 certain investment funds\nfor which the Company provides investment management services\nand personal estate trusts for which the Company provides\nadministrative, trustee and/or investment management services; \u2022\ncertain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the\nCompany provides secured credit facilities. The Company has no\ndecision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some\nof which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company\u2019s maximum\nexposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-\nrelated commitment. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nthe Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss related to these\ntransactions was $ 16.8billion and $ 33.6billion, respectively\n(for more information on these positions, see Note 13 and Note\n27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K); \u2022 certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the\nCompany holds securities in inventory, as these investments are\nmade on arm\u2019s-length terms; \u2022 certain positions in mortgage- and\nasset-backed securities held by the Company, which are\nclassified as Trading account assets or Investments , in which\nthe Company has no other involvement with the related\nsecuritization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 12 and\n21 for more information on these positions); \u2022 certain\nrepresentations and warranties exposures in Citigroup\nresidential mortgage securitizations, in which the original\nmortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and \u2022 VIEs\nsuch as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the\nCompany\u2019s funding activities. The Company does not have a\nvariable interest in these trusts. The asset balances for\nconsolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets\nconsolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent\nthe amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets\ndepending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or\nsecurity) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that\nclassification. The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in\nwhich the Company has significant involvement represent the most\ncurrent information available to the Company. In most cases, the\nasset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard\nto impairments, unless fair value information is readily\navailable to the Company. The maximum funded exposure represents\nthe balance sheet carrying amount of the Company\u2019s investment in\nthe VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the\nVIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal\npayments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for\nincreases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value\nrecognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded\npositions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount,\nincluding liquidity and credit facilities provided by the\nCompany or the notional amount of a derivative instrument\nconsidered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions,\nthe Company has entered into derivative instruments or other\narrangements that are not considered variable interests in the\nVIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where\nthe Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit\ndefault swap or total return swap where the Company pays the\ntotal return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under\nsuch arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure\namounts.\n                              161                               \nThe following tables present certain assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs), which are\nincluded on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets in the\ntable below include those assets that can only be used to settle\nobligations of consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those\nobligations. In addition, the assets in the table below include\nthird-party assets of consolidated VIEs only and exclude\nintercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The\nliabilities in the table below include third-party liabilities\nof consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that\neliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts\nwhere creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to\nthe general credit of Citigroup.\n

Citi did not transfer\nnon-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization\nentities during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThese securities are backed by either residential or commercial\nmortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients. As of\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Citi held noretained\ninterests in private label re-securitization transactions\nstructured by Citi. The Company also re-securitizes U.S.\ngovernment-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency)\nsecurities. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,\nCiti transferred agency securities with a fair value of\napproximately $ 3.3billion and $ 8.6billion, respectively, to\nre-securitization entities, compared to approximately $\n5.6billion and $ 14.9billion for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, the fair value\nof Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization\ntransactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $\n1.4billion (including $ 402million related to re-securitization\ntransactions executed in 2023), compared to $ 1.4billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 (including\n                              165                               \n$ 801million related to re-securitization transactions executed\nin 2022), which is recorded in Trading account assets . The\noriginal fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in\nwhich Citi holds a retained interest as of June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 were approximately $ 86.8billion and $\n79.4billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the Company did not consolidate any private label or\nagency re-securitization entities. Citi-Administered Asset-\nBacked Commercial Paper Conduits At June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had\napproximately $ 18.6billion and $ 19.6billion of purchased\nassets outstanding, respectively, and had incremental funding\ncommitments with clients of approximately $ 16.1billion and $\n13.9billion, respectively. Substantially all of the funding of\nthe conduits is in the form of short-term commercial paper. At\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted average\nremaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits\nwere approximately 66and 64days, respectively. Each asset\npurchased by the conduit is structured with transaction-specific\ncredit enhancement features provided by the third-party client\nseller, including over-collateralization, cash and excess spread\ncollateral accounts, direct recourse or third-party guarantees.\nThese credit enhancements are sized with the objective of\napproximating a credit rating of A or above, based on Citi\u2019s\ninternal risk ratings. In addition to the transaction-specific\ncredit enhancements, the conduits, other than the government-\nguaranteed loan conduit, have obtained letters of credit from\nthe Company, which equal at least 8% to 10% of the conduit\u2019s\nassets with a minimum of $ 350million. The letters of credit\nprovided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $\n1.9billion and $ 1.9billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. The net result across multiseller conduits\nadministered by the Company is that, in the event that defaulted\nassets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancements\ndescribed above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first\nto the Company and then to the commercial paper investors. At\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company owned $\n7.7billion and $ 8.6billion, respectively, of the commercial\npaper issued by its administered conduits. The Company\u2019s\ninvestments were not driven by market illiquidity and the\nCompany is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the conduits. Municipal Securities\nTender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts At June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, none of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB\ntrusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the\nCompany. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, liquidity\nagreements provided with respect to customer TOB trusts totaled\n$ 0.7billion and $ 1.1billion, respectively, of which $\n0.5billion and $ 0.7billion, respectively, were offset by\nreimbursement agreements. For the remaining exposure related to\nTOB transactions, where the residual owned by the customer was\nat least 25% of the bond value at the inception of the\ntransaction, no reimbursement agreement was executed. The\nCompany also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of\ncredit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which\nare not variable interest entities, and municipality-related\nissuers that totaled $ 1.4billion and $ 1.4billion as of June\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. These liquidity\nagreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement\nagreements with various term-out provisions.\n\nAsset-Based Financing\n\nThe primary types of Citi\u2019s asset-based financings, total assets\nof the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and\nCiti\u2019s maximum exposure to loss are presented below.

All\nderivatives are recorded in\nTrading account assets/Trading\naccount liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor additional information\nregarding Citi\u2019s use of and\naccounting for derivatives,\nsee Note 23 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. Information pertaining\nto Citigroup\u2019s derivatives\nactivities, based on notional\namounts, is presented in the\ntable below. Derivative\nnotional amounts are reference\namounts from which contractual\npayments are derived and do\nnot represent a complete\nmeasure of Citi\u2019s exposure to\nderivative transactions.\nCiti\u2019s derivative exposure\narises primarily from\n\nmarket fluctuations (i.e.,\nmarket risk), counterparty\nfailure (i.e., credit risk)\nand/or periods of high\nvolatility or financial stress\n(i.e., liquidity risk), as\nwell as any market valuation\nadjustments that may be\nrequired on the transactions.\nMoreover, notional amounts do\nnot reflect the netting of\noffsetting trades. For\nexample, if Citi enters into a\nreceive-fixed interest rate\nswap with $100 million\nnotional, and offsets this\nrisk with an identical but\nopposite pay-fixed position\nwith a different counterparty,\n$200 million in derivative\nnotionals is reported,\nalthough these offsetting\npositions may result in de\nminimis overall market risk.\nIn addition, aggregate\nderivative notional amounts\ncan fluctuate from period to\nperiod in the normal course of\nbusiness based on Citi\u2019s\nmarket share, levels of client\nactivity and other factors.\n\nDerivative Notionals\n

asset\u201d to another party (protection seller). These\narrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk\nassociated with the reference asset without directly purchasing\nthat asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions\nfor purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement,\nreduction of credit concentrations and diversification of\noverall risk.\n                              167                               \nThe following tables present\nthe gross and net fair values\nof the Company\u2019s derivative\ntransactions and the related\noffsetting amounts as of June\n30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022. Gross positive fair\nvalues are offset against\ngross negative fair values by\ncounterparty, pursuant to\nenforceable master netting\nagreements. Under ASC\n815-10-45, payables and\nreceivables in respect of cash\ncollateral received from or\npaid to a given counterparty\npursuant to a credit support\nannex are included in the\noffsetting amount if a legal\nopinion supporting the\nenforceability of netting and\ncollateral rights has been\nobtained. GAAP does not permit\nsimilar offsetting for\nsecurity collateral. In\naddition, the following tables\nreflect rule changes adopted\nby clearing organizations that\nrequire or allow entities to\ntreat certain derivative\nassets, liabilities and the\nrelated variation margin as\nsettlement of the related\nderivative fair values for\nlegal and accounting purposes,\nas opposed to presenting gross\nderivative assets and\nliabilities that are subject\nto collateral, whereby the\ncounterparties would also\nrecord a related collateral\npayable or receivable. The\ntables also present amounts\nthat are not permitted to be\noffset, such as security\ncollateral or cash collateral\nposted at third-party\ncustodians, but which would be\neligible for offsetting to the\nextent that an event of\ndefault has occurred and a\nlegal opinion supporting\nenforceability of the netting\nand collateral rights has been\nobtained.\n                              168

These cash flow hedging relationships\nuse either regression analysis or dollar-offset ratio analysis\nto assess whether the hedging relationships are highly effective\nat inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges, the\nentire change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is\nrecognized in AOCI and then reclassified to earnings in the same\nperiod that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings.\nThe net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to\nbe reclassified from AOCI within 12 months of June 30, 2023 is\napproximately $( 1.3) billion. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted cash flows are hedged is 13years. The pretax\nchange in AOCI from cash flow hedges is presented below. The\nafter-tax impact of cash flow hedges on AOCI is shown in Note\n18.\n                                                                \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026                                                      \n         \u2026               \u2026                                      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $          \u2026    $          \u2026    $             $           \n                 \u2026               \u2026                              \n      $          \u2026    $          \u2026    $             $           \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                              \n                 \u2026               \u2026                              \n                                                                \n      $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $  \u2014    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n         \u2026       \u2014       \u2026       \u2014                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $      $      $      $    \n              $  \u2026            $  \u2026           $             $    \n                                                                \n(1) All amounts reclassified into earnings for interest rate\ncontracts are included in Interest income/Interest expense (Net\ninterest income) .

Citi records the\nchange in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the\ntranslation adjustment for the investments in these foreign\nsubsidiaries in Foreign currency translation adjustment (CTA)\nwithin AOCI . The pretax gain (loss) recorded in CTA within AOCI\n, related to net investment hedges, was $( 272) million and $(\n948) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023\nand $ 836million and $ 641million for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2022, respectively. June 30, 2022 includes a $\n47million pretax loss related to net investment hedges that was\nreclassified from AOCI into earnings (recorded in Other revenue\n).\n\nCredit Derivatives\nThe following

      \nCredit Risk-Related Contingent\nFeatures in Derivatives\nCertain derivative instruments\ncontain provisions that\nrequire the Company to either\npost additional collateral or\nimmediately settle any\noutstanding liability balances\nupon the occurrence of a\nspecified event related to the\ncredit risk of the Company.\nThese events, which are\ndefined by the existing\nderivative contracts, are\nprimarily downgrades in the\ncredit ratings of the Company\nand its affiliates. The fair\nvalue (excluding CVA) of all\nderivative instruments with\ncredit risk-related contingent\nfeatures that were in a net\nliability position at June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022 was\n$ 16billion and $ 18billion,\nrespectively. The Company\nposted $ 14billion and $\n15billion as collateral for\nthis exposure in the normal\ncourse of business as of June\n30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. A\ndowngrade could trigger\nadditional collateral or cash\nsettlement requirements for\nthe Company and certain\naffiliates. In the event that\nCitigroup and Citibank were\ndowngraded a single notch by\nall threemajor rating agencies\nas of June 30, 2023, the\nCompany could be required to\npost an additional $\n0.8billion as either\ncollateral or settlement of\nthe derivative transactions.\nIn addition, the Company could\nbe required to segregate with\nthird-party custodians\ncollateral previously received\nfrom existing derivative\ncounterparties in the amount\nof $ 16million upon the single\nnotch downgrade, resulting in\naggregate cash obligations and\ncollateral requirements of\napproximately $ 0.8billion.\n\nDerivatives Accompanied by\nFinancial Asset Transfers For\ntransfers of financial assets\naccounted for as a sale by the\nCompany, and for which the\nCompany has retained\nsubstantially all of the\neconomic exposure to the\ntransferred asset through a\ntotal return swap executed\nwith the same counterparty in\ncontemplation of the initial\nsale (and still outstanding),\nthe asset amounts derecognized\nand the gross cash proceeds\nreceived as of the date of\nderecognition were $\n2.7billion and $ 1.4billion as\nof June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022, respectively. At\nJune 30, 2023, the fair value\nof these previously\nderecognized assets was $\n2.7billion. The fair value of\nthe total return swaps as of\nJune 30, 2023 was $ 39million\nrecorded as gross derivative\nassets and $ 24million\nrecorded as gross derivative\nliabilities. At December 31,\n2022, the fair value of these\npreviously derecognized assets\nwas $ 1.4billion, and the fair\nvalue of the total return\nswaps was $ 27million recorded\nas gross derivative assets and\n$ 32million recorded as gross\nderivative liabilities. The\nbalances for the total return\nswaps are on a gross basis,\nbefore the application of\ncounterparty and cash\ncollateral netting, and are\nincluded primarily as equity\nderivatives in the tabular\ndisclosures in this Note.\n                              176                               \n22. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT For\nadditional information\nregarding fair value\nmeasurement at Citi, see Note\n25 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Citi\u2019s\n2022 Form 10-K. Fair Value\nHierarchy ASC 820-10 specifies\na hierarchy of inputs based on\nwhether the inputs are\nobservable or unobservable.\nObservable inputs are\ndeveloped using market data\nand reflect market participant\nassumptions, while\nunobservable inputs reflect\nthe Company\u2019s market\nassumptions. These two types\nof inputs have created the\nfollowing fair value\nhierarchy: \u2022 Level 1: Quoted\nprices for identical\ninstruments in active markets.\n\u2022 Level 2: Quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments in active\nmarkets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar\ninstruments in markets that\nare not active and model-\nderived valuations in which\nall significant inputs and\nsignificant value drivers are\nobservable in the market. \u2022\nLevel 3: Valuations derived\nfrom valuation techniques in\nwhich one or more significant\ninputs or significant value\ndrivers are unobservable . As\nrequired under the fair value\nhierarchy, the Company\nconsiders relevant and\nobservable market inputs in\nits valuations where possible.\nThe fair value hierarchy\nclassification approach\ntypically utilizes rules-based\nand data-driven selection\ncriteria to determine whether\nan instrument is classified as\nLevel 1, Level 2 or Level 3: \u2022\nThe determination of whether\nan instrument is quoted in an\nactive market and therefore\nconsidered a Level 1\ninstrument is based upon the\nfrequency of observed\ntransactions and the quality\nof independent market data\navailable on the measurement\ndate. \u2022 A Level 2\nclassification is assigned\nwhere there is observability\nof prices/market inputs to\nmodels, or where any\nunobservable inputs are not\nsignificant to the valuation.\nThe determination of whether\nan input is considered\nobservable is based on the\navailability of independent\nmarket data and its\ncorroboration, for example\nthrough observed transactions\nin the market. \u2022 Otherwise, an\ninstrument is classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nMarket Valuation Adjustments\nThe table below summarizes the\ncredit valuation

In other instances, market changes have\nresulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some\nunobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall\nvaluation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-\nin or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $\n1.3billion and $ 6.1billion of certain structured long-term debt\nproducts being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.

Changes in fair value of fair value\noption liabilities related to changes in Citigroup\u2019s own credit\nspreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of AOCI . See Note 18\nfor additional information. Among other variables, the fair\nvalue of liabilities for which the fair value option has been\nelected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities)\nis impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company\u2019s credit\nspreads. The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-\nderivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company\u2019s own\ncredit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a loss\nof $( 837) million and gain of $ 2,592million for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a loss of\n$( 1,270) million and gain of $ 3,642million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in fair\nvalue resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk\nwere estimated by incorporating the Company\u2019s current credit\nspreads observable in the bond market into the relevant\nvaluation technique used to value each liability as described\nabove. The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial\nLiabilities Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under\nAgreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under\nAgreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain\nUncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings The Company elected the\nfair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income\nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities\nborrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-\nterm borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In each case, the\nelection was made because the related interest rate risk is\nmanaged on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting\nderivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value\nthrough earnings. Changes in fair value for transactions in\nthese portfolios are recorded in Principal transactions . The\nrelated interest revenue and interest expense are measured based\non the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are\nreported as Interest revenue and Interest expense in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Loans and Other Credit\nProducts Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for\ncertain other originated and purchased loans, including certain\nunfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of\ncredit, executed by Citigroup\u2019s lending and trading businesses.\nNone of these credit products are highly leveraged financing\ncommitments. Significant groups of transactions include loans\nand unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold\nor securitized in the near term, or transactions where the\neconomic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as\npurchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the\nCompany pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third\nparty. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate\naccounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex\nand to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not\nelected for most lending transactions across the Company.\nThe following table provides information about certain credit\nproducts carried at fair value:\n                                                                \n                                           Decemb\u2026              \n                June 30,                       31,              \n                    2023                      2022              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  In                                                            \n  millio\u2026        Trading       Loans       Trading       Loans  \n  of              assets                    assets              \n  dollars                                                       \n  Carryi\u2026                                                       \n  amount                                                        \n  report\u2026                                                       \n  on the     $     4,482    $  5,766    $    6,011    $  5,360  \n  Consol\u2026                                                       \n  Balance                                                       \n  Sheet                                                         \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess             161         156           167          51  \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                                                         \n  Balance                                                       \n  of                                                            \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                \u2014           2             \u2014           2  \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n  Aggreg\u2026                                                       \n  unpaid                                                        \n  princi\u2026                                                       \n  balance                                                       \n  in                                                            \n  excess                                                        \n  of                                                            \n  (less                                                         \n  than)                                                         \n  fair                                                          \n  value                \u2014           1             \u2014           \u2014  \n  for                                                           \n  non-ac\u2026                                                       \n  loans                                                         \n  or                                                            \n  loans                                                         \n  more                                                          \n  than 90                                                       \n  days                                                          \n  past                                                          \n  due                                                           \n                                                                \n                              198                               \nIn addition to the amounts reported above, $ 651million and $\n729million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit\nproducts selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as\nof June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Changes in\nthe fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are\nclassified in Principal transactions in Citi\u2019s Consolidated\nStatement of Income. Related interest revenue is measured based\non the contractual interest rates and reported as Interest\nrevenue on Trading account assets or loan interest depending on\nthe balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The\nchanges in fair value for the three months ended June 30, 2023\nand 2022 due to instrument-specific credit risk totaled to a\nloss of $ 25million and $( 47) million, respectively. Changes in\nfair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated\nbased on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and\nrecovery assumptions. Certain Investments in Unallocated\nPrecious Metals Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals\naccounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of\nits commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment\nis bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity\nderivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option\nfor the debt host contract, and reports the contract within\nTrading account assets on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. The total carrying amount of debt host contracts across\nunallocated precious metals accounts was approximately $\n0.6billion and $ 0.3billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. As part of its commodity trading activities,\nCiti trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes\nforward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with\ntrading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious\nmetals investment, Citi\u2019s receivable from its depository bank is\nrepaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated\nprecious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the\ntrading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is\naccounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.\nCertain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS) Citigroup has elected\nthe fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime\nfixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans\nHFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are\nhedged with derivative instruments.

There was no net change in fair value\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to\ninstrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes\nin the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in\naddition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest\nincome continues to be measured based on the contractual\ninterest rates and reported as Interest revenue in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Certain Debt Liabilities The\nCompany has elected the fair value option for certain debt\nliabilities, because these exposures are considered to be\ntrading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair\nvalue basis.

For\ncertain contracts meeting the\ndefinition of a guarantee, the\nguarantor must recognize, at\ninception, a liability for the\nfair value of the obligation\nundertaken in issuing the\nguarantee. In addition, the\nguarantor must disclose the\nmaximum potential amount of\nfuture payments that the\nguarantor could be required to\nmake under the guarantee, if\nthere were a total default by\nthe guaranteed parties. The\ndetermination of the maximum\npotential future payments is\nbased on the notional\n\namount of the guarantees\nwithout consideration of\npossible recoveries under\nrecourse provisions or from\ncollateral held or pledged. As\nsuch, Citi believes such\namounts bear no relationship\nto the anticipated losses, if\nany, on these guarantees.

indemnifications\nwere not material for either period presented, as the\nprobability of potential liabilities arising from these\nguarantees is minimal.\n\n(2) At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, this maximum\npotential exposure was estimated to be approximately $\n128billion and $ 130billion, respectively. However, Citi\nbelieves that the maximum exposure is not representative of the\nactual potential loss exposure based on its historical\nexperience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as\nmost products and services are delivered when purchased and\namounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.\n                              201                               \nLoans Sold with Recourse Loans sold with recourse represent\nCiti\u2019s obligations to reimburse the buyers for loan losses under\ncertain circumstances. Recourse refers to the clause in a sales\nagreement under which a seller/lender will fully reimburse the\nbuyer/investor for any losses resulting from the purchased\nloans. This may be accomplished by the sellers taking back any\nloans that become delinquent. In addition to the amounts\npresented in the tables above, Citi has recorded a repurchase\nreserve for its potential repurchases or make-whole liability\nregarding residential mortgage representation and warranty\nclaims related to its whole loan sales to U.S. government-\nsponsored agencies and, to a lesser extent, private investors.\nThe repurchase reserve was approximately $ 10million and $\n10million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively,\nand these amounts are included in Other liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Card Arrangements with\nPartners Citi, in one of its credit card partner arrangements,\nprovides guarantees to the partner regarding the volume of\ncertain customer originations during the term of the agreement.\nTo the extent that such origination targets are not met, the\nguarantees serve to compensate the partner for certain payments\nthat otherwise would have been generated in connection with such\noriginations. Other Guarantees and Indemnifications Credit Card\nProtection Programs Citi, through its credit card businesses,\nprovides various cardholder protection programs on several of\nits card products, including programs that provide insurance\ncoverage for rental cars, coverage for certain losses associated\nwith purchased products, price protection for certain purchases\nand protection for lost luggage. These guarantees are not\nincluded in the table, since the total outstanding amount of the\nguarantees and Citi\u2019s maximum exposure to loss cannot be\nquantified. The protection is limited to certain types of\npurchases and losses, and it is not possible to quantify the\npurchases that would qualify for these benefits at any given\ntime. Citi assesses the probability and amount of its potential\nliability related to these programs based on the extent and\nnature of its historical loss experience. At June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the actual and estimated losses incurred and\nthe carrying value of Citi\u2019s obligations related to these\nprograms were immaterial. Value-Transfer Networks (Including\nExchanges and Clearing Houses) (VTNs) Citi is a member of, or\nshareholder in, hundreds of value-transfer networks (VTNs)\n(payment, clearing and settlement systems as well as exchanges)\naround the world. As a condition of membership, many of these\nVTNs require that members stand ready to pay a pro rata share of\nthe losses incurred by the organization due to another member\u2019s\ndefault on its obligations. Citi\u2019s potential obligations may be\nlimited to its membership interests in the VTNs, contributions\nto the VTN\u2019s funds, or, in certain narrow cases, to the full pro\nrata share. The maximum exposure is difficult to estimate as\nthis would require an assessment of claims that have not yet\noccurred; however, Citi believes the risk of loss is remote\ngiven historical experience with the VTNs. Accordingly, Citi\u2019s\nparticipation in VTNs is not reported in the guarantees tables\nabove, and there are no amounts reflected on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of June 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022 for\npotential obligations that could arise from Citi\u2019s involvement\nwith VTN associations. Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance\nIndemnification Citi has an indemnification contingency to\nBrighthouse Financial in connection with Citi\u2019s sale of an\ninsurance subsidiary. A liability under this indemnification\nagreement is currently remote because Brighthouse Financial\nwould become responsible for LTC policyholder claims only when\nboth the reinsurance provided by other parties ceases and trust\nassets set aside to meet these claims are not adequate. However,\nshould events occur causing both the reinsurance protection and\ntrust collateral to become insufficient to cover Brighthouse\nFinancial\u2019s LTC policyholder claims, Citi will be required to\neither estimate and disclose a reasonably possible loss or range\nof loss to the extent that such an estimate can be made, or to\naccrue for such liability if the event becomes probable and\nestimable. Citi continues to closely monitor its potential\nexposure under this indemnification obligation. For additional\ninformation, see Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K. Futures and Over-the-\nCounter Derivatives Clearing Citi provides clearing services on\ncentral clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear\nexchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts\nwith CCPs. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, Citi\nhas concluded that it acts as an agent for accounting purposes\nin its role as clearing member for these client transactions. As\nsuch, Citi does not reflect the underlying exchange-traded or\nOTC derivatives contracts in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. See Note 21 for a discussion of Citi\u2019s derivatives\nactivities that are reflected in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements. As a clearing member, Citi collects and remits cash\nand securities collateral (margin) between its clients and the\nrespective CCP. In certain circumstances, Citi collects a higher\namount of cash (or securities) from its clients than it needs to\nremit to the CCPs. This excess cash is then held at depository\ninstitutions such as banks or carry brokers. There are two types\nof margin: initial and variation. Where Citi obtains benefits\nfrom or controls cash initial margin (e.g., retains an interest\nspread), cash initial margin collected from clients and remitted\nto the CCP or depository institutions is reflected within\nBrokerage payables (payables to customers) and Brokerage\nreceivables (receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing\norganizations) or Cash and due from banks , respectively.\nHowever, for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives\ncontracts where Citi does not obtain benefits from or control\nthe client cash balances, the client cash initial margin\ncollected from clients and remitted to the CCP or depository\ninstitutions is not reflected on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance\nSheet. These conditions are met when Citi has contractually\nagreed with the client that (i) Citi will pass\n                              202                               \nthrough to the client all interest paid by the CCP or depository\ninstitutions on the cash initial margin, (ii) Citi will not\nutilize its right as a clearing member to transform cash margin\ninto other assets, (iii) Citi does not guarantee and is not\nliable to the client for the performance of the CCP or the\ndepository institution and (iv) the client cash balances are\nlegally isolated from Citi\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The total amount\nof cash initial margin collected and remitted in this manner was\napproximately $ 18.3billion and $ 18.0billion as of June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Variation margin due\nfrom clients to the respective CCP, or from the CCP to clients,\nreflects changes in the value of the client\u2019s derivative\ncontracts for each trading day. As a clearing member, Citi is\nexposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure\nof a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative\nchanges in the value of the client\u2019s derivative contracts). In\nthe event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to\nclose out the client\u2019s positions. The CCP would typically\nutilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP,\nwith any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as\nclearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or\nsecurities margin posted by the client, which would typically be\nexpected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi\u2019s credit risk in the\nevent the client fails to perform. As required by ASC\n860-30-25-5, securities collateral posted by clients is not\nrecognized on Citi\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Carrying\nValue\u2014Guarantees and Indemnifications At June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities\nrelated to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the\ntables above amounted to approximately $ 1.2billion and $\n1.4billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and\nperformance guarantees is included in Other liabilities . For\nloans sold with recourse, the carrying value of the liability is\nincluded in Other liabilities . Collateral Cash collateral\navailable to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these\nguarantees and indemnifications amounted to $ 51.5billion and $\n51.8billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as\ncollateral amounted to $ 73.4billion and $ 63.7billion at June\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The majority of\ncollateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities\nlending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in\nfavor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $ 3.0billion and $\n3.7billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nOther property may also be available to Citi to cover losses\nunder certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the\nvalue of such property has not been determined.\n                              203                               \nPerformance Risk Presented in the tables below are the maximum\npotential amounts of future payments that are classified based\non internal and external credit ratings. The determination of\nthe maximum potential future payments is based on the notional\namount of the guarantees without consideration of possible\nrecoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or\npledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no\nrelationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these\nguarantees.\n                                                                \n

For purposes of this\nNote, Citigroup, its\naffiliates and subsidiaries\nand current and former\nofficers, directors, and\nemployees, are sometimes\ncollectively referred to as\nCitigroup and Related Parties.\nIn accordance with ASC 450,\nCitigroup establishes accruals\nfor contingencies, including\nany litigation, regulatory, or\ntax matters disclosed herein,\nwhen Citigroup believes it is\nprobable that a loss has been\nincurred and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably\nestimated. Once established,\naccruals are adjusted from\ntime to time, as appropriate,\nin light of additional\ninformation. The amount of\nloss ultimately incurred in\nrelation to those matters may\nbe substantially higher or\nlower than the amounts accrued\nfor those matters. With\nrespect to previously incurred\nloss contingencies for which\nrecovery is expected, Citi\napplies loss recovery\naccounting when disputes and\nuncertainties affecting\nrecognition are resolved. If\nCitigroup has not accrued for\na matter because the matter\ndoes not meet the criteria for\naccrual (as set forth above),\nor Citigroup believes an\nexposure to loss exists in\nexcess of the amount accrued\nfor a particular matter, in\neach case assuming a material\nloss is reasonably possible\nbut not probable, Citigroup\ndiscloses the matter. In\naddition, for such matters,\nCitigroup discloses an\nestimate of the aggregate\nreasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss in excess of the\namounts accrued for those\nmatters for which an estimate\ncan be made. At June 30, 2023,\nCitigroup estimates that the\nreasonably possible unaccrued\nloss for these matters ranges\nup to approximately $\n1.3billion in the aggregate.\nAs available information\nchanges, the matters for which\nCitigroup is able to estimate\nwill change, and the estimates\nthemselves will change. In\naddition, while many estimates\npresented in financial\nstatements and other financial\ndisclosures involve\nsignificant judgment and may\nbe subject to significant\nuncertainty, estimates of the\nrange of reasonably possible\nloss arising from litigation,\nregulatory, tax, or other\nmatters are subject to\nparticular uncertainties. For\nexample, at the time of making\nan estimate, Citigroup may\nonly have preliminary or\nincomplete information about\nthe facts underlying the\nclaim; its assumptions about\nthe future rulings of the\ncourt or other tribunal on\nsignificant issues, or the\nbehavior and incentives of\nadverse parties, regulators,\nor tax authorities may prove\nto be wrong; and the outcomes\nit is attempting to predict\nare often not amenable to the\nuse of statistical or other\nquantitative analytical tools.\nIn addition, from time to time\nan outcome may occur that\nCitigroup had not accounted\nfor in its estimates because\nit had deemed such an outcome\nto be remote. For all these\nreasons, the amount of loss in\nexcess of amounts accrued in\nrelation to matters for which\nan estimate has been made\ncould be substantially higher\nor lower than the range of\nloss included in the estimate.\nSubject to the foregoing, it\nis the opinion of Citigroup\u2019s\nmanagement, based on current\nknowledge and after taking\ninto account its current\naccruals, that the eventual\noutcome of all\n\nmatters described in this Note\nwould not be likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the\nconsolidated financial\ncondition of Citigroup.\nNonetheless, given the\nsubstantial or indeterminate\namounts sought in certain of\nthese matters and the inherent\nunpredictability of such\nmatters, an adverse outcome in\ncertain of these matters\ncould, from time to time, have\na material adverse effect on\nCitigroup\u2019s consolidated\nresults of operations or cash\nflows in particular quarterly\nor annual periods. For further\ninformation on ASC 450 and\nCitigroup\u2019s accounting and\ndisclosure framework for\ncontingencies, including for\nany litigation, regulatory,\nand tax matters disclosed\nherein, see Note 29 to the\nConsolidated Financial\nStatements in Citi\u2019s 2022 Form\n10-K. FDIC Special Assessment\nOn May 11, 2023, the FDIC\nissued a notice of proposed\nrulemaking that would\nimplement a special\nassessment\u2014primarily upon\nlarge banks\u2014to recover the\nuninsured deposit losses from\nthe failures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank. The\nFDIC estimated that of the\ncost of the failures of\nSilicon Valley Bank and\nSignature Bank, approximately\n$15.8 billion was attributable\nto the protection of uninsured\ndepositors, an estimate that\nwill be periodically adjusted.\nThe FDIC has proposed\ncollecting the special\nassessment at an annual rate\nof approximately 12.5 basis\npoints of uninsured deposits\nover eight quarterly\nassessment periods beginning\nin 2024. There is sufficient\nuncertainty around the final\nFDIC regulation that would\nimpact both the timing and\namount. If the final rule for\nthe FDIC special assessment is\nenacted as proposed, which is\nexpected before the end of\n2023, Citi estimates that the\nimpact would be significant,\npotentially a pretax charge of\nup to $ 1.5billion. This\namount is not included in the\nreasonably possible loss\nestimate above.
