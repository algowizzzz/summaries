Our expenses primarily\nconsist of the provision for credit losses,\noperating expenses, marketing expenses and\nincome taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at\nthe consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments,\nare included in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d).\n                                              \n  4    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our commercial and industrial\ncustomers typically include companies with\nannual revenues between $20 million and $2\nbillion.\n                                              \n   Business Developments                      \n                                              \nWe regularly explore and evaluate\nopportunities to acquire financial services\nand products as well as financial assets,\nincluding credit card and other loan\nportfolios, and enter into strategic\npartnerships as part of our growth strategy.\nWe also explore opportunities to acquire\ntechnology companies and related assets to\nimprove our information technology\ninfrastructure and to deliver on our digital\nstrategy.

We transformed how we work\nin order to protect the well-being of our\nassociates and our customers, and were able to\ncontinue to serve our customers, successfully\nmanage critical functions, and keep our lines\nof business operating.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a\nsignificant majority of our associates across\nour workforce have transitioned to working\nremotely, relying on our technology\ninfrastructure and systems that have been\ndesigned for resilience and security. The\nmajority of our associates will continue to\nwork remotely through the summer of 2021. Our\ncurrent plan is to adopt a hybrid work\nmethodology on September 7, 2021 that allows\nfor in-office collaboration while still\nenabling associates to work remotely. We\ncontinue to monitor local conditions to ensure\nthe safety of our associates.\n\nFor more information see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Overview\u2014Coronavirus Disease 2019\n(COVID-19) Pandemic\u201d and \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1A.

metrics provide\nuseful insight to investors and users of our\nfinancial information as they provide an\nalternate measurement of our performance and\nassist in assessing our capital adequacy and\nthe level of return generated.\n                                              \n   Table 1:                                   \n                                              \n

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\ncalculation of our residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments, are included in the\nOther category.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenue and expenses directly or\nindirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation process is\nunique to each business segment and acquired\nbusiness. We regularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n\nWe refer to the business segment results\nderived from our internal management\naccounting and reporting process as our\n\u201cmanaged\u201d presentation, which differs in some\ncases from our reported results prepared based\non U.S. GAAP.

Moreover, the Banks,\nas insured depository institutions, are\nsubject to prompt corrective action (\u201cPCA\u201d)\ncapital regulations.\n                                              \n  Basel III and United States Capital Rules   \n                                              \nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer and countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirements, as described\nbelow.\n\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve, OCC and\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the\n\u201cFDIC,\u201d and collectively, the \u201cFederal Banking\nAgencies\u201d) amended the Basel III Capital Rules\nto provide for tailored application of certain\ncapital requirements across different\ncategories of banking institutions (the\n\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). These categories are\ndetermined primarily by an institution\u2019s asset\nsize, with adjustments to a more stringent\ncategory possible if the institution exceeds\ncertain risk-based thresholds. As a bank\nholding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nthat does not exceed any of the applicable\nrisk-based thresholds, we are a Category III\ninstitution under the Tailoring Rules.\nTherefore, effective January 1, 2020, we are\nno longer subject to the Basel III \u201cAdvanced\nApproaches\u201d framework and certain associated\ncapital requirements, and we have elected to\nexclude certain elements of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our\nregulatory capital as permitted by the\nTailoring Rules. We remain subject to the\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%) and\nsupplementary leverage ratio requirement,\nwhich were previously required only for Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches institutions.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe G-SIB Surcharge. We are not a G-SIB based\non the most recent available data and thus we\nare not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. The\ncapital conservation buffer for BHCs was\npreviously fixed at 2.5%. In March 2020, the\nFederal Reserve issued a final rule to\nimplement the stress capital buffer\nrequirement (the \u201cStress Capital Buffer\nRule\u201d). The stress capital buffer requirement\nis institution-specific and replaces the fixed\n2.5% capital conservation buffer for BHCs.\n\nPursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule,\nthe Federal Reserve will use the results of\nits supervisory stress test to determine the\nsize of a BHC\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement. In particular, a BHC\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement will equal, subject\nto a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the\ndifference between the BHC\u2019s starting CET1\ncapital ratio and its lowest projected CET1\ncapital\n                                              \n  30    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nratio under the severely adverse scenario of\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test\nplus (ii) the ratio of the BHC\u2019s projected\nfour quarters of common stock dividends (for\nthe fourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the BHC\u2019s projected\nCET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under\nthe supervisory stress test.\n\nUnder the Stress Capital Buffer Rule\nframework, the Company\u2019s new \u201cstandardized\napproach capital conservation buffer\u201d includes\nits stress capital buffer requirement (which\nwill be recalibrated every year based on the\nCompany\u2019s supervisory stress test results),\nany G-SIB surcharge (which is not applicable\nto us) and the countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement (which is currently set at 0%).\nAny determination to increase the\ncountercyclical capital buffer generally would\nbe effective twelve months after the\nannouncement of such an increase, unless the\nFederal Banking Agencies set an earlier\neffective date.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2020 supervisory stress\ntesting results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement is 5.6% for the period from\nOctober 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021.\nTherefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 10.1%,\n11.6% and 13.6%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2020 through September 30,\n2021.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2021 supervisory stress\ntesting results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is\n2.5%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%,\n8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Banks. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, each Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios remain at 7.0%, 8.5% and\n10.5% respectively.\n\nIf we fail to maintain our capital ratios\nabove the minimum capital requirements plus\nthe applicable buffer requirements, we will\nface increasingly strict automatic limitations\non capital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively, each of the Company and the\nBanks exceeded the minimum capital\nrequirements and the buffer requirements\napplicable to them, and each of the Banks was\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d under PCA requirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading portfolios. The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more. As of June 30, 2021, the Company and\nCONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d below for\nadditional information.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (the \u201c2020 CECL Transition Rule\u201d) that\nprovides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the current expected credit loss\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) standard on their regulatory capital\n(the \u201c2020 CECL Transition Election\u201d).\n\nPursuant to the 2020 CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution may elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies use a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions are permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. Beginning January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year.

As\na BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely\ndependent upon the receipt of dividends or\nother payments from our subsidiaries.

As of June 30, 2021, funds available\nfor dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were\n$2.1 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively.\nThere can be no assurance that we will declare\nand pay any dividends to stockholders.\n\nOn January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors\nauthorized the repurchase of up to $7.5\nbillion of shares of our common stock. We\nrepurchased approximately $1.7 billion of\nshares of our common stock during the second\nquarter of 2021 and $2.2 billion during the\nfirst six months of 2021, consistent with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s temporary capital\ndistribution restrictions in place during the\nfirst six months of 2021.\n\nThe timing and exact amount of any future\ncommon stock repurchases will depend on\nvarious factors, including regulatory\napproval, market conditions, opportunities for\ngrowth, our capital position and the amount of\nretained earnings. Our stock repurchase\nprogram does not include specific price\ntargets, may be executed through open market\npurchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1\nprograms, and may be suspended at any time.\nFor additional information on dividends and\nstock repurchases, see \u201cMD&A\u2014Capital\nManagement\u2014Capital Planning and Regulatory\nStress Testing\u201d and \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Dividends,\nStock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds\u201din\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  35    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                   \n  RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                   \n                                              \n   Risk Management Framework                  \n                                              \nOur Risk Management Framework (the\n\u201cFramework\u201d) sets consistent expectations for\nrisk management across the Company.

Each\nline of business or first line function is\nresponsible for managing the risks associated\nwith their activities, including identifying,\nassessing, measuring, monitoring, controlling\nand reporting the risks within its business\nactivities, consistent with the risk\nframework. The \u201cSecond Line of Defense\u201d\nconsists of two types of functions:\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d) and\nSupport Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking\nactivities and assesses risks and issues\nindependent from the first line of defense.\nSupport Functions are centers of specialized\nexpertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting,\nLegal) that provide support services to the\nCompany. The \u201cThird Line of Defense\u201d is\ncomprised of the Internal Audit and Credit\nReview functions. The third line provides\nindependent and objective assurance to senior\nmanagement and to the Board of Directors that\nthe first and second lines of defense have\nsystems and governance processes which are\nwell-designed and working as intended, and\nthat the Framework is appropriate for our\nsize, complexity and risk profile.\n\nOur Framework consists of the following nine\nelements:\n                                              \n  Govern\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Accoun\u2026                                     \n  Strate\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Risk                                        \n  Alignm\u2026                                     \n             Assessm\u2026    Monitor\u2026    Aggreg\u2026  \n  Risk       Measure\u2026    and         Report\u2026  \n  Identi\u2026    and         Testing     and      \n             Response                Escala\u2026  \n  Capital                                     \n  and                                         \n  Liquid\u2026                                     \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Stress                                      \n  Testin\u2026                                     \n  Risk                                        \n  Data                                        \n  and                                         \n  Enabli\u2026                                     \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Culture                                     \n  and                                         \n  Talent                                      \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  36    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe provide additional discussion of our risk\nmanagement principles, roles and\nresponsibilities, framework and risk appetite\nunder \u201cMD&A\u2014Risk Management\u201d in our 2020 Form\n10-K.\n                                              \n  Risk Categories                             \n                                              \nWe apply our Framework to protect the Company\nfrom the major categories of risk that we are\nexposed to through our business activities.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 22 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of June 30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020.\n                                              \n  Table 22: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            June 30,         December     \n  portfoli\u2026         2021         31, 2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             72  %            69  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or              28               31     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             48  %            46  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660           20               20     \n  620 or              32               34     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

Interest income\nforegone related to nonperforming loans was\n$30 million and $35 million in the first six\nmonths of 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nForegone interest income represents the amount\nof interest income in excess of recognized\ninterest income that would have been recorded\nduring the period for nonperforming loans as\nof the end of the period had the loans\nperformed according to their contractual\nterms.\n\n(2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated\nbased on nonperforming loans for each category\ndivided by period-end total loans held for\ninvestment for each respective category.\n\n(3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit\ncard loans, nonperforming loans as a\npercentage of total loans held for investment\nwas 0.67% and 0.65% as of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.\n\n(4) The denominators used in calculating\nnonperforming asset rates consist of total\nloans held for investment and other\nnonperforming assets.\n                                              \n  Net Charge-Offs                             \n                                              \nNet charge-offs consist of the amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, of loans\nheld for investment that we determine to be\nuncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We\ncharge off loans as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses when we determine\nthe loan is uncollectible and record\nsubsequent recoveries of previously charged\noff amounts as increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Uncollectible finance charges\nand fees are reversed through revenue and\ncertain fraud losses are recorded in other\nnon-interest expense. Generally, costs to\nrecover charged off loans are recorded as\ncollection expenses as incurred and included\nin our consolidated statements of income as a\ncomponent of other non-interest expense.

The effective\ninterest rate in effect immediately prior to\nthe loan modification is used as the effective\ninterest rate for purposes of measuring\nimpairment using the present value of expected\ncash flows. If the customer does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then the\ncredit card loan agreement may revert to its\noriginal payment terms, generally resulting in\nany loan outstanding reflected in the\nappropriate delinquency category and charged\noff in accordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, an interest rate reduction or\nprincipal reduction, or a combination of these\nconcessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\namortized cost.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, with a portion of these loans\nreceiving an interest rate reduction or a\ngross balance reduction. The impairment on\nmodified commercial loans is generally\ndetermined based on the underlying collateral\nvalue.\n\nWe provide additional information on modified\nloans accounted for as TDRs, including the\nperformance of those loans\n                                              \n  46    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nsubsequent to modification, in \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans.\u201d\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance.

The\nprovision for losses on unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in the provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income and the related reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments is included in other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.

The NSFR Rule requires the Company and\neach of the Banks to maintain an amount of\navailable stable funding, which is a weighted\nmeasure of a company\u2019s funding sources over a\none-year time horizon, calculated by applying\nstandardized weightings to equity and\nliabilities based on their expected stability,\nthat is no less than the amount of required\nstable funding, which is calculated by\napplying standardized weightings to assets,\nderivatives exposures and certain other items\nbased on their liquidity characteristics. As a\nCategory III institution, the Company and the\nBanks are required to maintain available\nstable funding in an amount at least equal to\n85% of its required stable funding. The NSFR\nRule became effective on July 1, 2021 and\napplies to the Company and each of the Banks.\nThe NSFR Rule includes a semi-annual\ndisclosure requirement, with the first public\ndisclosure required after June 30, 2023.\n                                              \n  Borrowing Capacity                          \n                                              \nWe maintain a shelf registration with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) so\nthat we may periodically offer and sell an\nindeterminate aggregate amount of senior or\nsubordinated debt securities, preferred stock,\ndepositary shares, common stock, purchase\ncontracts, warrants and units.

In addition to\nour existing assets and liabilities, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions, such as loan and deposit growth\nand pricing, and plans for projected changes\nin our funding mix in our baseline forecast.\nIn measuring the sensitivity of interest rate\nmovements on our projected net interest\nincome, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous\nparallel shift in the level of interest rates\ndetailed in Table 35 below. At the current\nlevel of interest rates, our net interest\nincome is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate\nscenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward\nshocks has decreased as compared to December\n31, 2020, mainly due to the increase in long-\nterm interest rates.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity                    \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact on the net\npresent value of our assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivative exposures, resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Key\nassumptions used in the calculation include\nprojecting rate sensitive prepayments for\nmortgage securities, loans and other assets,\nterm structure modeling of interest rates,\ndiscount spreads, and deposit volume and\npricing assumptions. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\neconomic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n35 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity increasing in\nmoderately higher interest rate scenarios (+50\nand +100 bps), while decreasing in a lower\ninterest rate scenario (-50 bps). Similar to\nthe changes in net interest income\nsensitivity, our current economic value of\nequity sensitivity to upward shocks has also\ndecreased as compared to December 31, 2020\nmainly due to the increase in long term\ninterest rates.\n\nTable 35 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand economic value of equity calculated under\nthe methodology described above as of June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020. In instances where\nan interest rate scenario would result in a\nrate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for\nthat scenario. This assumption applies only to\njurisdictions that do not have negative policy\nrates. In jurisdictions that have negative\npolicy rates, we do not floor interest rates\nat 0%.\n                                              \n  54    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   Table 35: Interest Rate Sensitivity        \n   Analysis                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n                June 30,         December     \n                    2021         31, 2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  projected                                   \n  baseline                                    \n  net                                         \n  interest                                    \n  income:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis              4.0  %           5.6  %  \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis              3.3              4.3     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis          1.9              2.4     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis         -1.3             -0.9     \n  points                                      \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  economic                                    \n  value of                                    \n  equity:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis             -0.2              4.2     \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis              2.8              6.0     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis          2.1              4.0     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis         -3.7             -7.0     \n  points                                      \n                                              \nIn addition to these industry standard\nmeasures, we also consider the potential\nimpact of alternative interest rate scenarios,\nsuch as stressed rate shocks as well as\nsteepening and flattening yield curve\nscenarios in our internal interest rate risk\nmanagement decisions.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments. Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on the existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cNote 8\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities.\u201d\n                                              \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                       \n                                              \nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to\nchanges in the values of current holdings and\nfuture cash flows denominated in other\ncurrencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nintercompany funding outstanding was 320\nmillion GBP as of both June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, and 4.7 billion CAD and 5.3\nbillion CAD as of June 30, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively. Our EUR-denominated\nborrowings outstanding were 1.3 billion EUR as\nof both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n                                              \n  55    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet to\ntranslation risk in AOCI and our capital\nratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 1.7 billion\nGBP as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020, and 1.7 billion CAD and 1.5 billion CAD\nas of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal. For further information on our\nrisk related to customer accommodation\nderivatives, see \u201cNote 8\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\nTransition\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority (\u201cFCA\u201d), the regulator for the\nadministration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR\nwould be transitioned as an interest rate\nbenchmark and that it will no longer compel\nbanks to contribute LIBOR data beyond December\n31, 2021. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nestablished the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a group of private market\nparticipants and ex-officio members\nrepresenting banking and financial sector\nregulators. The ARRC has recommended Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the\npreferred alternative rate for certain U.S.\ndollar derivative and cash instruments. While\nthe ARRC has recommended SOFR as the\nreplacement rate for LIBOR, some market\nparticipants have begun using alternate rates\nfeaturing a credit-sensitive element. We are\ncontinuing to evaluate the different LIBOR\nalternatives and how their progression will\nimpact our transition efforts.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark\nAdministration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of\nLIBOR, confirmed its intention to cease\npublication of the 1-week and 2-month USD\nLIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR\npublication on December 31, 2021, and the\nremaining USD LIBOR tenors (overnight; 1, 3,\n6, and 12 months) immediately following the\nLIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The\ncontinuation of USD LIBOR as a representative\nrate into mid-2023 will allow many legacy USD\nLIBOR contracts to mature prior to cessation.\nFollowing IBA\u2019s announcement, the FCA formally\nannounced the future permanent cessation and\nloss of representativeness of LIBOR\nbenchmarks.\n\nWe have exposures to LIBOR, including loans,\nderivative contracts, unsecured debt,\nsecuritizations, vendor agreements and other\ninstruments with attributes that are either\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. To\nfacilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR,\nwe have established a company-wide, cross-\nfunctional initiative to oversee and manage\nour transition away from LIBOR and other\nInterbank Offered Rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d) to\nalternative reference rates.\n\nWe have made progress on our transition\nefforts as we continue to insert LIBOR\ntransition language (\u201cfallback language\u201d) in\nnew and existing lending contracts as well as\nfallback language in derivatives contracts and\nagreements that adheres to the International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association (\u201cISDA\u201d)\nfallback protocol.\nWe also continue to focus our transition\nefforts on:\n\n\u2022 monitoring market developments and industry\npractices related to SOFR and other LIBOR\nreplacement indexes;\n\n\u2022 originating loans and transacting in\ninstruments indexed to SOFR and other LIBOR\nreplacement rates;\n\n\u2022 reviewing existing legal contracts and\nagreements and assessing fallback language\nimpacts;\n\n\u2022 monitoring and reducing our inventory of\nLIBOR exposures;\n                                              \n  56    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u2022 building internal operational readiness and\nrisk management processes, including exposure\nreporting;\n\n\u2022 implementing necessary updates to our\ninfrastructure including systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes; and\n\n\u2022 engaging with our clients, industry working\ngroups, and regulators.\nFor a further discussion of the various risks\nwe face in connection with the expected\nreplacement of LIBOR on our operations, see\n\u201cPart I\u2014Item 1A.

We present our auto\nloan portfolio by FICO scores at origination\nand our retail banking loan portfolio by\ndelinquency status, which includes all past\ndue loans, both performing and nonperforming.\nTable 3.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by\nCredit Quality Indicator\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  83    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Amounts represent period-end loans held\nfor investment in each credit score category.\nAuto credit scores generally represent average\nFICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus\nat the time of application and are not\nrefreshed thereafter.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses for commercial loans. Generally,\nloans that are designated as criticized\nperforming and criticized nonperforming are\nreviewed quarterly by management to determine\nif they are appropriately classified/rated and\nwhether any impairment exists. Noncriticized\nloans are also generally reviewed, at least\nannually, to determine the appropriate risk\nrating. In addition, we evaluate the risk\nrating during the renewal process of any loan\nor if a loan becomes past due.\n                                              \n  84    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of June 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. When developing an estimate of\nexpected credit losses, we use both\nquantitative and qualitative methods in\nconsidering all available information relevant\nto assessing collectability. This may include\ninternal information, external information or\na combination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nSignificant judgment is applied in our\nestimation of lifetime credit losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d in our 2020 Form 10-K for further\ndiscussion of the methodology and policy for\ndetermining our allowance for credit losses\nfor each of our loan portfolio segments, as\nwell as information on our reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020.

partnership\nagreements that are presented within our\nconsolidated financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses. See \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\u201d in our 2020 Form 10-K for\nfurther discussion of our credit card\npartnership agreements.\nThe table below summarizes the

transactions with\nentities that are considered to be variable\ninterest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which have provided a source of funding\nfor us and enabled us to transfer a certain\nportion of the economic risk of the loans or\nrelated debt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet our maximum remaining funding\nobligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We\nseparately present information for\nconsolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  9\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       31       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       57       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  94    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       17       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       43       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities owned by the VIE, which\nincludes the seller\u2019s interest and repurchased\nnotes held by other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.2billion of assets and $\n606million of liabilities as of June 30, 2021,\nand $ 2.3billion of assets and $ 596million of\nliabilities as of December 31, 2020.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to Government-\nsponsored enterprise (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service\nthe transferred loans pursuant to the\nguidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an\ninvestor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and\nABS in our investment securities portfolio,\nwhich represent variable interests in the\nrespective securitization trusts from which\nthose securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either invest in securities issued by\nthe VIE and were not involved in the design of\nthe VIE or no transfers have occurred between\nthe VIE and us. Our maximum exposure to loss\nas a result of our involvement with these VIEs\nis the carrying value of the MSRs and\ninvestment securities on our consolidated\nbalance sheets as well as our contractual\nobligations under loss sharing arrangements.\nSee \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d\nfor information related to our MSRs associated\nwith these securitizations and \u201cNote\n2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for more information\non the securities held in our investment\nsecurities portfolio. In addition, where we\nhave certain lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business with entities that\ncould be VIEs, we have also excluded these\nVIEs from the tables presented in this note.\nSee \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for additional information\nregarding our lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business.\n                                              \n  95    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents our continuing\ninvolvement in certain securitization-related\nVIEs as of June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020.\nTable 5.2: Continuing Involvement in\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n                                              \n  (Doll\u2026                                      \n  in                                          \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  June                                        \n  30,           Credit                        \n  2021:           Card             Auto       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  held                                        \n  by        $    9,054         $  1,507       \n  third\u2026                                      \n  inves\u2026                                      \n  Recei\u2026                                      \n  in the        21,803            1,664       \n  trust                                       \n  Cash                                        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  spread             0               10       \n  or                                          \n  reser\u2026                                      \n  accou\u2026                                      \n  Retai\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Servi\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  retai\u2026                                      \n  Decem\u2026                                      \n  31,                                         \n  2020:                                       \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  held                                        \n  by        $   10,361         $  2,053       \n  third\u2026                                      \n  inves\u2026                                      \n  Recei\u2026                                      \n  in the        23,683            2,243       \n  trust                                       \n  Cash                                        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  spread             0               10       \n  or                                          \n  reser\u2026                                      \n  accou\u2026                                      \n  Retai\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Servi\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  retai\u2026                                      \n                                              \nCredit Card Securitizations\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card\nloans which provides a source of funding for\nus. Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritization involves the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain investments in qualified\naffordable housing projects using the\nproportional amortization method if certain\ncriteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the six months ended June 30,\n2021 and June 30, 2020, we recognized\namortization of $ 317million and $ 285million,\nrespectively, and tax credits of $ 423million\nand $ 622million, respectively, associated\nwith these investments within income tax\nprovision or benefit. The carrying value of\nour equity investments in these qualified\naffordable housing projects was $ 4.6billion\nand $ 4.5billion as of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively. We are\nperiodically required to provide additional\nfinancial or other support during the period\nof the investments.

We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.8billion and $ 4.6billion as of June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The\ncreditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit and we do not provide\nadditional financial or other support other\nthan during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n11.6billion and $ 11.0billion as of June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.0billion as of both June 30,\n2021 and December 31, 2020 are reflected on\nour consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans\nheld for investment, and other assets. The\nliabilities are reflected in other\nliabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no\nrecourse to our general credit. We have not\nprovided additional financial or other support\nother than during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it.\n\nOther\n\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We were not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance. Our maximum exposure to these\nVIEs is limited to the investments on our\nconsolidated balance sheets of $ 411million\nand $ 436million as of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020, respectively.

and Accounting for\nDerivatives\nWe regularly enter into derivative\ntransactions to support our overall risk\nmanagement activities. Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency swaps to hedge, but we may\nalso use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We then enter\ninto derivative contracts with counterparties\nto economically hedge substantially all of our\nsubsequent exposures.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d) . Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the forecasted transactions\nimpact earnings and presented in the same line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income\nas the earnings effect of the hedged items.\nOur cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps\nand floors that are intended to hedge the\nvariability in interest receipts or interest\npayments on some of our variable-rate\nfinancial assets or liabilities. We also enter\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  100    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that arises from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the\nIntercontinental Exchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH\nGroup (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs for our centrally\ncleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral\ncontracts, we enter into agreements directly\nwith our derivative counterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements, where possible, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. The amount of collateral\nexchanged is dependent upon the fair value of\nthe derivative instruments as well as the fair\nvalue of the pledged collateral and will vary\nover time as market variables change. When\nvaluing collateral, an estimate of the\nvariation in price and liquidity over time is\nsubtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d to\ndiscount the value of the collateral pledged.\nOur exposure to derivative counterparty credit\nrisk, at any point in time, is equal to the\namount reported as a derivative asset on our\nbalance sheet. The fair value of our\nderivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis\nto take into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand any associated cash collateral received or\npledged. See Table 8.3 for our net exposure\nassociated with derivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. Futures commission merchants\n(\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the intermediary between\nCCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial\nand variation margin through our FCMs to\nmitigate the risk of non-payment or default.\nInitial margin is required upfront by CCPs as\ncollateral against potential losses on our\ncleared derivative contracts and variation\nmargin is exchanged on a daily basis to\naccount for mark-to-market changes in those\nderivative contracts. For CME, ICE and LCH-\ncleared OTC derivatives, we characterize\nvariation margin cash payments as settlements.\nOur FCM agreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand collateral agreements, where possible,\nwith bilateral derivative counterparties to\nmitigate the risk of default. We review our\ncollateral positions on a daily basis and\nexchange collateral with our counterparties in\naccordance with these agreements. These\nbilateral agreements typically provide the\nright to offset exposure with the same\ncounterparty and require the party in a net\nliability position to post collateral.\nAgreements with certain bilateral\ncounterparties require both parties to\nmaintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of derivative instruments exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty.

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period. We consider all available\ninformation, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs.\nFor additional information on the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities on a\nrecurring basis, see \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value\nMeasurement\u201d in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following table displays our assets and\nliabilities measured on our consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of June 30, 2021 and December 31,\n2020.\nTable 11.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       9      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       2       \u2026      0             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  115    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents balance sheet netting of\nderivative assets and liabilities, and related\npayables and receivables for cash collateral\nheld or placed with the same counterparty.

Generally, transfers into Level\n3 were primarily driven by the usage of\nunobservable assumptions in the pricing of\nthese financial instruments as evidenced by\nwider pricing variations among pricing vendors\nand transfers out of Level 3 were primarily\ndriven by the usage of assumptions\ncorroborated by market observable information\nas evidenced by tighter pricing among multiple\npricing sources.\nTable 11.2: Level 3 Recurring Fair Value\nRollforward\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  116    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n                                              \n  117    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n(1) Realized gains (losses) on securities\navailable for sale are included in net\nsecurities gains (losses) and retained\ninterests in securitizations are reported as a\ncomponent of non-interest income in our\nconsolidated statements of income.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity\nand credit spreads, in isolation, would result\nin a decrease in the fair value measurement.\nIn addition, an increase in default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by a decrease\nin recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and\nan increase in liquidity spreads.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements\n\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a segment, such as management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio,\nasset/liability management by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and residual tax\nexpense or benefit to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate that is not\nassessed to our primary business segments, are\nincluded in the Other category.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess provides a funds credit for sources of\nfunds, such as deposits generated by our\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a funds charge for the use of\nfunds by each segment. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate third-party rates. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d in\nour 2020 Form 10-K.\nSegment Results and Reconciliation\nWe may periodically change our business\nsegments or reclassify business segment\nresults based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies or changes\nin organizational alignment. The following\ntable presents our business segment results\nfor the three and six months ended June 30,\n2021 and 2020, selected balance sheet data as\nof June 30, 2021 and 2020, and a\nreconciliation of our total business segment\nresults to our reported consolidated income\nfrom continuing operations, loans held for\ninvestment and deposits.\n                                              \n  122

Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as overdrafts and\nAutomated teller machine (\u201cATM\u201d) usage.\nService charges and other customer-related\nfees within our Commercial Banking business\nare mostly related to fees earned on treasury\nmanagement and capital markets services. Other\ncontract revenue in our Credit Card business\nconsists primarily of revenue from our\npartnership arrangements. Other contract\nrevenue in our Consumer Banking business\nconsists primarily of revenue earned on\ncertain marketing and promotional events from\nour auto dealers. Revenue from contracts with\ncustomers is included in non-interest income\nin our consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table presents revenue from\ncontracts with customers and a

The contractual amount of these\ncommitments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to us should the counterparty draw\nupon the commitment. We generally manage the\npotential risk of unfunded lending commitments\nby limiting the total amount of arrangements,\nmonitoring the size and maturity structure of\nthese portfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of June 30, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020.

We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of the loans.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair\nvalue option on new loss sharing agreements.\nUnrealized gains and losses are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income. For those loss sharing\nagreements entered into as of and prior to\nDecember 31, 2019, we amortize the liability\nrecorded at inception into non-interest income\nas we are released from risk of payment under\nthe loss sharing agreement and record our\nestimate of expected credit losses each period\nin provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The\nliability recognized on our consolidated\nbalance sheets for these loss sharing\nagreements was $ 93million and $ 97million as\nof June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\nSee \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and\nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for\nmore information related to our credit card\npartnership loss sharing arrangements.\n                                              \n  126    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nLitigation\n\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for litigation-related matters that\narise from the ordinary course of our business\nactivities when it is probable that a loss\nassociated with a claim or proceeding has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of June\n30, 2021 are approximately $ 250million. Our\nreserve and reasonably possible loss estimates\ninvolve considerable judgment and reflect that\nthere is still significant uncertainty\nregarding numerous factors that may impact the\nultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding, our\nattempt to estimate a reasonably possible\nrange of loss beyond our current accrual\nlevels for some litigation matters based on\ncurrent information, it is possible that\nactual future losses will exceed both the\ncurrent accrual level and the range of\nreasonably possible losses disclosed here.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties involved in\nthese matters, especially those involving\ngovernmental agencies, and the very large or\nindeterminate damages sought in some of these\nmatters, there is significant uncertainty as\nto the ultimate liability we may incur from\nthese litigation matters and an adverse\noutcome in one or more of these matters could\nbe material to our results of operations or\ncash flows for any particular reporting\nperiod.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds settlements for its member\nbanks, and any settlements related to\nMasterCard-allocated losses have either\nalready been paid or are reflected in our\nreserves.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we\nare subject to numerous legal proceedings and\nother inquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We were named as a\ndefendant in approximately 74putative consumer\nclass action cases ( 61in U.S. federal courts\nand 13in Canadian courts) alleging harm from\nthe Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various\nremedies, including monetary and injunctive\nrelief. The lawsuits allege breach of\ncontract, negligence, violations of various\nprivacy laws and a variety of other legal\ncauses of action. The U.S. consumer class\nactions have been consolidated for pretrial\nproceedings before a multi-district litigation\n(\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria\nDivision, where the remaining 29consumer class\nactions are currently pending. In the third\nquarter of 2020, the MDL court denied in part\nand granted in part Capital One\u2019s motion to\ndismiss and permitted pretrial discovery to\ncontinue.\n                                              \n  127    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nSecurities class action . The Company and\ncertain officers have also been named as\ndefendants in a putative class action pending\nin the MDL alleging violations of certain\nfederal securities laws in connection with\nstatements and alleged omissions in securities\nfilings relating to our information security\nstandards and practices. The complaint seeks\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief.\n\nGovernmental inquiries . We have received\ninquiries and requests for information\nrelating to the Cybersecurity Incident from\nCongress, federal regulators, relevant\nCanadian regulators, the Department of\nJustice, and the offices of approximately\nfourteen state Attorneys General. We are\ncooperating with these offices and responding\nto their inquiries.\n\nIn August 2020, we entered into consent orders\nwith the Federal Reserve and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) resulting\nfrom regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity\nIncident and relating to ongoing enhancements\nof our cybersecurity and operational risk\nmanagement processes. We paid an $ 80million\npenalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the\nOCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement\ndid not contain a monetary penalty.\nTaxi Medallion Finance Investigations\nBeginning in 2019, we have received subpoenas\nfrom the New York Attorney General\u2019s office\nand from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nSouthern District of New York, Civil and\nCriminal Divisions, relating to investigations\nof the taxi medallion finance industry we\nexited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek,\namong other things, information regarding our\nlending counterparties and practices. We are\ncooperating with these investigations.\nU.K. PPI Litigation\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received\ncustomer complaints and regulatory claims\nrelating to PPI. As of the first quarter of\n2021, COEP has materially resolved the PPI\ncomplaints and regulatory claims received\nprior to the deadline. Some of the claimants\nin the U.K. PPI regulatory claims process have\nsubsequently initiated legal proceedings,\nseeking additional redress. We are responding\nto these proceedings as we receive them.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  128    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.
