Our expenses primarily\nconsist of the provision for credit losses,\noperating expenses, marketing expenses and\nincome taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at\nthe consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments,\nare included in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in the United\nKingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) and Canada.\n                                              \n  4    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our commercial and industrial\ncustomers typically include companies with\nannual revenues between $20 million and $2\nbillion.\n                                              \n   Business Developments                      \n                                              \nWe regularly explore and evaluate\nopportunities to acquire financial services\nand products as well as financial assets,\nincluding credit card and other loan\nportfolios, and enter into strategic\npartnerships as part of our growth strategy.\nWe also explore opportunities to acquire\ntechnology companies and related assets to\nimprove our information technology\ninfrastructure and to deliver on our digital\nstrategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund\nour acquisitions. In addition, we regularly\nconsider the potential disposition or exit of\ncertain assets, branches, partnership\nagreements or lines of business.\n                                              \n  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)         \n  Pandemic                                    \n                                              \nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global\npublic-health crisis, disrupting economies and\nintroducing significant volatility into\nfinancial markets. We transformed how we work\nin order to protect the well-being of our\nassociates and our customers, and were able to\ncontinue to serve our customers, successfully\nmanage critical functions, and keep our lines\nof business operating.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a\nsignificant majority of our associates across\nour workforce have transitioned to working\nremotely, relying on our technology\ninfrastructure and systems that have been\ndesigned for resilience and security. The\nmajority of our associates continue to work\nremotely. In the future, we plan to adopt a\nhybrid work methodology that allows for in-\noffice collaboration while still enabling\nassociates to work remotely. We continue to\nmonitor local conditions to ensure the safety\nof our associates.\n\nFor the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic\nimpacted our financial results, refer to \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 2. MD&A.\u201d The extent to which the\nCOVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial\ncondition will depend on future developments\nthat are still uncertain and cannot be\npredicted, including the scope and duration of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by\ngovernmental authorities and other third\nparties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor more information see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1A.

We also provide\nselected key metrics we use in evaluating our\nperformance, including certain metrics that\nare computed using non-GAAP measures. We\nconsider these metrics to be key financial\nmeasures that management uses in assessing our\noperating performance, capital adequacy and\nthe level of returns generated.

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\ncalculation of our residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments, are included in the\nOther category.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenue and expenses\n                                              \n  16    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Total interest income and\nnon-interest income are directly attributable\nto the segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation process is\nunique to each business segment and acquired\nbusiness. We regularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nWe refer to the business segment results\nderived from our internal management\naccounting and reporting process as our\n\u201cmanaged\u201d presentation, which differs in some\ncases from our reported results prepared based\non U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore,\nthe managed presentation of our business\nsegment results may not be comparable to\nsimilar information provided by other\nfinancial services companies. In addition, our\nindividual business segment results should not\nbe used as a substitute for comparable results\ndetermined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nWe summarize our business segment results for\nthe first quarters of 2022 and 2021 and\nprovide a comparative discussion of these\nresults, as well as changes in our financial\ncondition and credit performance metrics as of\nMarch 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021.\nWe provide a reconciliation of our total\nbusiness segment results to our reported\nconsolidated results in \u201cNote 12\u2014Business\nSegments and Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers.\u201d\n                                              \n  Business Segment Financial Performance      \n                                              \nTable 8 summarizes our business segment\nresults, which we report based on revenue\n(loss) and income (loss) from continuing\noperations, for the first quarters of 2022 and\n2021.\n                                              \n   Table                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n   8                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n   : Business Segment Results                 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Total net revenue (loss) consists of net\ninterest income and non-interest income.\n\n(2) Net income (loss) for our business\nsegments and the Other category is based on\nincome (loss) from continuing operations, net\nof tax.\n\n(3) Some of our commercial investments\ngenerate tax-exempt income, tax credits or\nother tax benefits.

our\nConsumer Banking business for the first\nquarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter\nof 2021, and changes in financial condition\nand credit performance between March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021 include the following:\n\n\u2022 Net Interest Income: Net interest income\nincreased by $83 million to $2.1 billion in\nthe first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by\ngrowth in our auto loan portfolio as well as\nhigher deposits in our Retail Banking\nbusiness.\n\n\u2022 Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income\nremained substantially flat at $105 million in\nthe first quarter of 2022.\n\n\u2022 Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for\ncredit losses increased by $256 million to\n$130 million as our allowance for credit\nlosses was held substantially flat in the\nfirst quarter of 2022 compared to an allowance\nrelease in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n\u2022 Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense\nincreased by $119 million to $1.2 billion in\nthe first quarter of 2022 primarily driven by\ncontinued investment in technology and\ninfrastructure, as well as growth in our auto\nloan portfolio.\n\nLoans Held for Investment:\n\n\u2022 Period-end loans held for investment\nincreased by $2.7 billion to $80.3 billion as\nof March 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021\nprimarily driven by growth in our auto loan\nportfolio due to higher originations.\n\n\u2022 Average loans held for investment increased\nby $9.5 billion to $78.7 billion in the first\nquarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter\nof 2021 primarily driven by growth in our auto\nloan portfolio due to higher originations.\n\nDeposits:\n\n\u2022 Period-end deposits increased by $2.0\nbillion to $258.4 billion as of March 31, 2022\nfrom December 31, 2021 primarily driven by our\nnational banking strategy.\n\nNet Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics:\n\n\u2022 The net charge-off rate increased by 23\nbasis points to 0.75% in the first quarter of\n2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021\nprimarily driven by lower auto recoveries as\nfavorable credit performance in recent\nquarters led to a decrease in recoverable\nbalances.\n\n\u2022 The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 53\nbasis points to 4.13% as of March 31, 2022\nfrom December 31, 2021 primarily driven by\nseasonally lower auto delinquency inventories.\n

loans and deposits and non-\ninterest income earned from products and\nservices provided to our clients such as\ncapital markets and treasury management.\nBecause our Commercial Banking business has\nloans and investments that generate tax-exempt\nincome, tax credits or other tax benefits, we\npresent the revenues on a taxable-equivalent\nbasis. Expenses primarily consist of the\nprovision for credit losses and operating\ncosts.\n\nOur Commercial Banking business generated net\nincome from continuing operations of $296\nmillion and $416 million in the first quarters\nof 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nTable 11 summarizes the financial results of\nour Commercial Banking business and displays\nselected key metrics for the

We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer and countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirements as described\nbelow.\n\nAs a Category III institution, we are not\nsubject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches\nframework and certain associated capital\nrequirements, and we have elected to exclude\ncertain elements of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our\nregulatory capital as permitted for a Category\nIII institution.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe \u201cG-SIB Surcharge.\u201d We are not a G-SIB\nbased on the most recent available data and\nthus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s final rule to implement the\nstress capital buffer requirement (the \u201cStress\nCapital Buffer Rule\u201d), the Company\u2019s\n\u201cstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer\u201d includes its stress capital buffer\nrequirement (as described below), any G-SIB\nSurcharge (which is not applicable to us) and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%). Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC\nand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the\n\u201cFDIC\u201d), hereafter collectively referred to as\nthe \u201cFederal Banking Agencies\u201d, set an earlier\neffective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be recalibrated every year\nbased on the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults. In particular, the Company\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement equals, subject to\na floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference\nbetween the Company\u2019s starting CET1 capital\nratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital\nratio under the severely adverse scenario of\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test\nplus (ii) the ratio of the Company\u2019s projected\nfour quarters of common stock dividends (for\nthe fourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the Company\u2019s\nprojected CET1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2021 supervisory stress\ntesting results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is\n2.5%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%,\n8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Banks. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, each Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%\nrespectively.\n\nIf the Company or any of the Banks fails to\nmaintain its capital ratios above the minimum\ncapital requirements plus the applicable\ncapital conservation buffer requirements, it\nwill face increasingly strict automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments to certain\nexecutive officers.\n\nAs of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively, each of the Company and the\nBanks exceeded the minimum capital\nrequirements and the capital conservation\nbuffer requirements applicable to them, and\neach of the Company and the Banks were \u201c well-\ncapitalized .\u201d The \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nstandards applicable to the Company are\nestablished in the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nregulations, and the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nstandards applicable to the Banks are\nestablished in the OCC\u2019s PCA capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading book. The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more.

We adopted\nthe CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as\nof January 1, 2020, and made the CECL\nTransition Election (for regulatory capital\npurposes) in the first quarter of 2020.\nTherefore, the applicable amounts presented in\nthis Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

As\na BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely\ndependent upon the receipt of dividends or\nother payments from our subsidiaries. The\nBanks are subject to regulatory restrictions\nthat limit their ability to transfer funds to\nour BHC. As of March 31, 2022, there were $892\nmillion of funds available for dividend\npayments from COBNA and no funds available for\ndividend payments from CONA. There can be no\nassurance that we will declare and pay any\ndividends to stockholders.\n\nIn January 2022, our Board of Directors\nauthorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion\nof shares of our common stock. We repurchased\napproximately $2.4 billion of shares of our\ncommon stock during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn April 2022, our Board of Directors\nauthorized the repurchase of up to an\nadditional $5 billion of shares of our common\nstock beginning in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nThe timing and exact amount of any future\ncommon stock repurchases will depend on\nvarious factors, including regulatory\napproval, market conditions, opportunities for\ngrowth, our capital position and the amount of\nretained earnings. Our stock repurchase\nprogram does not include specific price\ntargets, may be executed through open market\npurchases, tender offers, or privately\nnegotiated transactions, including utilizing\nRule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at\nany time.

It also\nsets expectations for our \u201cThree Lines of\nDefense\u201d model, which defines the roles,\nresponsibilities and accountabilities for\ntaking and managing risk across the Company.\nAccountability for overseeing an effective\nFramework resides with our Board of Directors\neither directly or through its committees.\n\nThe \u201cFirst Line of Defense\u201d consists of any\nline of business or function that is\naccountable for risk taking and is responsible\nfor: (i) engaging in activities designed to\ngenerate revenue or reduce expenses; (ii)\nproviding operational support or servicing to\nany business function for the delivery of\nproducts or services to customers; or (iii)\nproviding technology services in direct\nsupport of first line business areas. Each\nline of business or first line function must\nmanage the risks associated with their\nactivities, including identifying, assessing,\nmeasuring, monitoring, controlling and\nreporting the risks within its business\nactivities, consistent with the risk\nframework. The \u201cSecond Line of Defense\u201d\nconsists of two types of functions:\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d) and\nSupport Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking\nactivities and assesses risks and issues\nindependent from the first line of defense.\nSupport Functions are centers of specialized\nexpertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting,\nLegal) that provide support services to the\nCompany. The \u201cThird Line of Defense\u201d is\ncomprised of the Internal Audit and Credit\nReview functions. The third line provides\nindependent and objective assurance to senior\nmanagement and to the Board of Directors that\nthe first and second lines of defense have\nsystems and governance processes which are\nwell-designed and working as intended, and\nthat the Framework is appropriate for our\nsize, complexity and risk profile.\n\nOur Framework consists of the following nine\nelements:\n                                              \n  Govern\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Accoun\u2026                                     \n  Strate\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Risk                                        \n  Alignm\u2026                                     \n             Assessm\u2026    Monitor\u2026    Aggreg\u2026  \n  Risk       Measure\u2026    and         Report\u2026  \n  Identi\u2026    and         Testing     and      \n             Response                Escala\u2026  \n  Capital                                     \n  and                                         \n  Liquid\u2026                                     \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Stress                                      \n  Testin\u2026                                     \n  Risk                                        \n  Data                                        \n  and                                         \n  Enabli\u2026                                     \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Culture                                     \n  and                                         \n  Talent                                      \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  33    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe provide additional discussion of our risk\nmanagement principles, roles and\nresponsibilities, framework and risk appetite\nunder \u201cMD&A\u2014Risk Management\u201d in our 2021 Form\n10-K.\n                                              \n  Risk Categories                             \n                                              \nWe apply our Framework to protect the Company\nfrom the major categories of risk that we are\nexposed to through our business activities.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021.\n                                              \n  Table 21: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            March 31,        December     \n  portfoli\u2026          2022        31, 2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater              70  %           71  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or               30              29     \n  below                                       \n  Total               100  %          100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater              51  %           50  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660            20              20     \n  620 or               29              30     \n  below                                       \n  Total               100  %          100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

We\ncharge off loans as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses when we determine\nthe loan is uncollectible and record\nsubsequent recoveries of previously charged\noff amounts as increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Uncollectible finance charges\nand fees are reversed through revenue and\ncertain fraud losses are recorded in other\nnon-interest expense. Generally, costs to\nrecover charged off loans are recorded as\ncollection expenses as incurred and are\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense. Our charge-off policy for loans\nvaries based on the loan type.

The effective\ninterest rate on the loan immediately prior to\nthe loan modification is used as the effective\ninterest rate for purposes of measuring\nimpairment using the present value of expected\ncash flows. If the customer does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then the\ncredit card loan agreement may revert to its\noriginal payment terms, generally resulting in\nany loan outstanding reflected in the\nappropriate delinquency category and charged\noff in accordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our loans modified as TDRs receive an\nextension, an interest rate reduction or\nprincipal reduction, or a combination of these\nmodifications. In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\namortized cost.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of loans modified as TDRs receive an\nextension, with a portion of these loans\nreceiving an interest rate reduction or a\ngross balance reduction. The impairment on\nmodified commercial loans is generally\ndetermined based on the underlying collateral\nvalue.\n\nAs part of our response to the COVID-19\npandemic, we offered programs to accommodate\ncustomer hardship across our lines of business\nin the first quarter of 2020. Our COVID-19\nprograms were designed to be short-term\naccommodations so that we could provide our\ncustomers with prompt relief. Also in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic, additional guidance\nwas issued by the Federal Banking Agencies and\ncontained in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) which\nprovided banking organizations with TDR relief\nfor loan modifications to certain qualifying\nborrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile the majority of enrollments in our\nCOVID-19 programs were short-term and would\ngenerally not have resulted in TDR\nclassification under our existing policies,\nsome of these modification would have been\ndesignated as TDRs without the relief provided\nby the additional guidance issued by the\nFederal Banking Agencies and contained in the\nCARES Act. Therefore, the expiry of the\nguidance in the CARES Act on January 1, 2022,\nalong with our concurrent cessation in\napplying the additional guidance issued by the\nFederal Banking Agencies, drove an increase in\nreported TDRs for the three months ending\nMarch 31, 2022 as seen in the table below.\n                                              \n  43    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 27 presents our amortized cost of loans\nmodified in TDR as of March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, which excludes loan\nmodifications that do not meet the definition\nof a TDR.\n                                              \n  Table 27: Troubled Debt Restructurings      \n                                              \n                                              \n           Ma\u2026                  D\u2026            \n           31,                  3\u2026            \n           20\u2026                  2\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (\u2026               %                    %     \n  in       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026     \n                  M\u2026                  Mo\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026    $  389    2\u2026    %    $  3\u2026    23\u2026  %  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       174        9.3       1\u2026    10\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       563        30\u2026       5\u2026    34\u2026     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  b\u2026                                          \n  A\u2026       740    3\u2026            6\u2026    36\u2026     \n  R\u2026        13    0\u2026            13    0.8     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       753    4\u2026            6\u2026    37\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       557    2\u2026            4\u2026    27\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  1,\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    10\u2026  %  \n  S\u2026                                          \n  of                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    $  1,\u2026    8\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    78\u2026  %  \n  N\u2026       355    1\u2026            3\u2026    21\u2026     \n  T\u2026    $  1,\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    10\u2026  %  \n                                              \nWe provide additional information on modified\nloans accounted for as TDR, including the\nperformance of those loans subsequent to\nmodification, in \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans.\u201d Recently\nissued accounting standards eliminate the\naccounting guidance for TDRs effective for\nfiscal years beginning on or after December\n15, 2022, see \u201cMD&A\u2014Accounting Changes and\nDevelopments\u201d for additional information on\naccounting standards issued but not yet\nadopted.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date.

The NSFR Rule requires the\nCompany and each of the Banks to maintain an\namount of available stable funding, which is a\nweighted measure of a company\u2019s funding\nsources over a one-year time horizon,\ncalculated by applying standardized weightings\nto equity and liabilities based on their\nexpected stability, that is no less than a\nspecified percentage of its required stable\nfunding, which is calculated by applying\nstandardized weightings to assets, derivatives\nexposures and certain other items based on\ntheir liquidity characteristics. As a Category\nIII institution, the Company and the Banks are\neach required to maintain available stable\nfunding in an amount at least equal to 85% of\nits required stable funding. The NSFR Rule\nbecame effective on July 1, 2021 and applies\nto the Company and each of the Banks. The NSFR\nRule includes a semi-annual public disclosure\nrequirement, with the first disclosure due 45\ndays after the end of the second quarter of\n2023. The Company and the Banks exceeded the\nNSFR Rule requirement as of March 31, 2022.\n                                              \n  Borrowing Capacity                          \n                                              \nWe maintain a shelf registration with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) so\nthat we may periodically offer and sell an\nindeterminate aggregate amount of senior or\nsubordinated debt securities, preferred stock,\ndepositary shares, common stock, purchase\ncontracts, warrants and units. There is no\nlimit under this shelf registration to the\namount or number of such securities that we\nmay offer and sell, subject to market\nconditions. In addition, we also maintain a\nshelf registration that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $30 billion\nof securitized debt obligations from our\ncredit card loan securitization trust and,\neffective as of April 18, 2022, a shelf\nregistration that allows us to periodically\noffer and sell up to $25 billion of\nsecuritized debt obligations from our auto\nloan securitization trusts, which represents a\n$5 billion increase from the previous shelf\nregistration. The registered amounts under\nthese shelf registration statements are\nsubject to continuing review and change in the\nfuture, including as part of the routine\nrenewal process.\n\nIn addition to our issuance capacity under the\nshelf registration statements, we also have\naccess to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve\nDiscount Window and the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation\u2019s general collateral financing\nrepurchase agreement service. The ability to\nborrow utilizing these sources is based on\nmembership status and the amount is dependent\nupon the Banks\u2019 ability to post collateral. As\nof March 31, 2022, we pledged both loans and\nsecurities to the FHLB to secure a maximum\nborrowing capacity of $18.6 billion, of which\n$4.1 billion was used. Our FHLB membership is\nsupported by our investment in FHLB stock of\n$180 million and $32 million as of March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively,\nwhich was determined in part based on our\noutstanding advances. As of March 31, 2022, we\npledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity\nof $22.9 billion under the Federal Reserve\nDiscount Window.

We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or re-pricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments which could\ninclude caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact on our projected 12-month\nbaseline net interest income resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. In addition to\nour existing assets and liabilities, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions, such as loan and deposit growth\nand pricing, and plans for projected changes\nin our funding mix in our baseline forecast.\nIn measuring the sensitivity of interest rate\nmovements on our projected net interest\nincome, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous\nparallel shift in the level of interest rates\ndetailed in Table 34 below. At the current\nlevel of interest rates, our net interest\nincome is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease in lower rate\nscenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward\nshocks has decreased as compared to December\n31, 2021, mainly due to the increase in market\ninterest rates.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity                    \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact on the net\npresent value of our assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivative exposures, resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Key\nassumptions used in the calculation include\nprojecting rate sensitive prepayments for\nmortgage securities, loans and other assets,\nterm structure modeling of interest rates,\ndiscount spreads, and deposit volume and\npricing assumptions. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\neconomic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n34 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity decreases in all\ninterest rate scenarios. Our current economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity to upward shocks\nin an extreme interest rate scenario (+200\nbps) became more negative as compared to\nDecember 31, 2021 mainly due to the increase\nin long-term interest rates.\n\nTable 34 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand economic value of equity calculated under\nthe methodology described above as of March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In instances\nwhere an interest rate scenario would result\nin a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%\nfor that scenario. This assumption applies\nonly to jurisdictions that do not have\nnegative policy rates. In jurisdictions that\nhave negative policy rates, we do not floor\ninterest rates at 0%.\n                                              \n  51    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   Table 34: Interest Rate Sensitivity        \n   Analysis                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n                March 31,        December     \n                     2022        31, 2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  projected                                   \n  baseline                                    \n  net                                         \n  interest                                    \n  income:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis               1.3  %          3.4  %  \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis               1.1             2.5     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis           0.6             1.5     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis          -0.7            -1.8     \n  points                                      \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  economic                                    \n  value of                                    \n  equity:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis              -5.1            -0.7     \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis              -0.8             1.9     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis          -0.2             1.4     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis          -0.5            -2.6     \n  points                                      \n                                              \nIn addition to these industry standard\nmeasures, we also consider the potential\nimpact of alternative interest rate scenarios,\nsuch as stressed rate shocks as well as\nsteepening and flattening yield curve\nscenarios in our internal interest rate risk\nmanagement decisions.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments. Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on the existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cNote 8\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities.\u201d\n                                              \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                       \n                                              \nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to\nchanges in the values of current holdings and\nfuture cash flows denominated in other\ncurrencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nintercompany funding outstanding was 545\nmillion GBP and 520 million GBP as of March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively,\nand 3.0 billion CAD and 5.0 billion CAD as of\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. Our EUR-denominated borrowings\noutstanding were 1.2 billion EUR as of both\nMarch 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n                                              \n  52    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet to\ntranslation risk in AOCI and our capital\nratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 1.8 billion\nGBP as of both March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, and 2.1 billion CAD and 1.9 billion CAD\nas of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal. For further information on our\nrisk related to customer accommodation\nderivatives, see \u201cNote 8\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\nTransition\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority (\u201cFCA\u201d), the regulator for the\nadministration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR\nwould be transitioned as an interest rate\nbenchmark and that it will no longer compel\npanel banks to contribute LIBOR data beyond\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark\nAdministration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of\nLIBOR, confirmed its intention to cease\npublication of the 1-week and 2-month USD\nLIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR\npublication on December 31, 2021, and the\nremaining USD LIBOR tenors (overnight; 1, 3,\n6, and 12 months) immediately following the\nLIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The\ncontinuation of USD LIBOR as a representative\nrate into mid-2023 will allow many legacy USD\nLIBOR contracts to mature prior to cessation.\nFollowing IBA\u2019s announcement, the FCA formally\nannounced the future permanent cessation and\nloss of representativeness of LIBOR\nbenchmarks. The Federal Banking Agencies\nissued further guidance that banking\norganizations should cease using USD LIBOR as\na reference rate in new contracts as soon as\npracticable and in any event by December 31,\n2021. Consistent with the Federal Banking\nAgencies\u2019 guidance, we ceased entering into\nnew contracts referencing USD LIBOR as a\nreference rate as of January 1, 2022, subject\nto certain permissible exceptions.\n\nOur enterprise LIBOR transition program team,\nwhich has been working on this effort since\n2018 and includes senior management\nrepresentatives from across the enterprise,\nprovides monthly reporting to senior\nmanagement and quarterly reporting to our\nBoard of Directors. The information provided\nto senior management and the Board of\nDirectors includes exposure reporting, updates\non progress toward our goals to reduce our\nLIBOR exposure and relevant regulatory or\nindustry developments.\n\nOur LIBOR transition effort is focused on\nproactively transitioning exposures to an\nalternative rate or incorporating transition\nlanguage (\u201cfallback language\u201d) to provide a\ncontractual mechanism for transitioning upon\nthe LIBOR cessation. Our fallback language\naligns with the language recommended by the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d)\nin our existing lending contracts and the\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (\u201cISDA\u201d) in our derivative\ncontracts and agreements to the greatest\nextent possible.\n\nWe continue to focus our LIBOR transition\nefforts on:\n\n\u2022 monitoring established controls to prevent\nthe origination of LIBOR indexed instruments\n\n\u2022 working with impacted customers and\ncounterparties to remediate remaining LIBOR\ncontracts\n\n\u2022 engaging with our clients, industry working\ngroups, and regulators\n                                              \n  53    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 assessing the remediation offered by\nrecently enacted federal legislation. The\nlegislation provides clarity on a replacement\nbenchmark rate for certain contracts if a\npracticable interest rate fallback method has\nnot been established.\n\nThe majority of LIBOR contracts that we have\ntransitioned to alternative rates have\nemployed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d). In the U.S., SOFR has been selected\nas the preferred alternative rate by the ARRC\nfor certain U.S. dollar derivative and cash\ninstruments. We have proactively worked with\ncustomers and prepared our systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes to focus\noriginations on SOFR and other non-LIBOR rates\nand will continue to do so. While the majority\nof our non-LIBOR transactions have utilized\nSOFR, we have also employed credit sensitive\nalternative rates to LIBOR, to a limited\nextent, in response to customer demand.\n\nTo track transition status, instruments are\ncategorized based on whether they have\nfallback language (which may or may not adhere\nto the ISDA and ARRC standards), have no\nfallback language or have not yet been\nassessed for fallback language. Instruments\nwith no fallback language or those not yet\nassessed represent a higher risk for not\ntransitioning from LIBOR by June 30, 2023. The\nmajority of the instruments maturing after\nJune 30, 2023 are derivatives and commercial\nloans, which are summarized in the table\nbelow. Of these instruments, the majority\ncontain fallback language which adheres to the\nISDA and ARRC standards. We will continue to\nfocus on reducing our LIBOR exposures through\nour transition efforts, normal operations and\ncustomer interactions.\nTable 35: LIBOR Exposures on Derivatives and\nCommercial Loans\n                                              \n                                       Total  \n                                       LIBOR  \n                                       Comm\u2026  \n                           Total       Matu\u2026  \n                           LIBOR       after  \n              March       Commi\u2026        June  \n  (Dol\u2026         31,       Matur\u2026         30,  \n  in           2022        after        2023  \n  mill\u2026       Total         June       With\u2026  \n  Expo\u2026       LIBOR          30,       Fall\u2026  \n  Type\u2026       Comm\u2026         2023       Lang\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comm\u2026    $  81,4\u2026    $  61,383    $  1,841  \n  loans                                       \n  Deri\u2026       91,9\u2026       59,433       14,1\u2026  \n  Total    $  173,\u2026    $  120,8\u2026    $  15,9\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n                                       Total  \n                                       LIBOR  \n                                       Comm\u2026  \n                           Total       Matu\u2026  \n                           LIBOR       after  \n              Dece\u2026       Commi\u2026        June  \n  (Dol\u2026         31,       Matur\u2026         30,  \n  in           2021        after        2023  \n  mill\u2026       Total         June       With\u2026  \n  Expo\u2026       LIBOR          30,       Fall\u2026  \n  Type\u2026       Comm\u2026         2023       Lang\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Comm\u2026    $  101,\u2026    $  71,874    $  2,047  \n  loans                                       \n  Deri\u2026       103,\u2026       64,605       14,5\u2026  \n  Total    $  205,\u2026    $  136,4\u2026    $  16,5\u2026  \n                                              \n_________\n(1) Commercial loan balances represent maximum\npotential exposures and derivatives represent\nnotional exposure.\n\nThese transition efforts have been implemented\nto remediate our remaining LIBOR contracts by\nJune 30, 2023.\n\nFor a further discussion of the various risks\nwe face in connection with the expected\nreplacement of LIBOR on our operations, see\n\u201cPart I\u2014Item 1A.

We therefore generally\nmanage credit risk based on portfolios with\ncommon risk characteristics. The risk in our\ncredit card loan portfolio correlates to broad\neconomic trends, such as unemployment rates\nand and the U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product\n(\u201cGDP\u201d) Rate, as well as consumers\u2019 financial\ncondition, all of which can have a material\neffect on credit performance.

We present our auto\nloan portfolio by FICO scores at origination\nand our retail banking loan portfolio by\ndelinquency status, which includes all past\ndue loans, both performing and nonperforming.\nTable 3.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by\nCredit Quality Indicator\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  78    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Amounts represent period-end loans held\nfor investment in each credit score category.\nAuto credit scores generally represent average\nFICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus\nat the time of application and are not\nrefreshed thereafter.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses for commercial loans. Generally,\nloans that are designated as criticized\nperforming and criticized nonperforming are\nreviewed quarterly by management to determine\nif they are appropriately classified/rated and\nwhether any impairment exists. Noncriticized\nloans are also generally reviewed, at least\nannually, to determine the appropriate risk\nrating. In addition, we evaluate the risk\nrating during the renewal process of any loan\nor if a loan becomes past due.\n                                              \n  79    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. Significant judgment is applied in\nour estimation of lifetime credit losses. When\ndeveloping an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d in our 2021 Form 10-K for further\ndiscussion of the methodology and policy for\ndetermining our allowance for credit losses\nfor each of our loan portfolio segments, as\nwell as information on our reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the three months ended March 31,\n2022 and 2021.

financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses.

Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which has provided a source of funding\nfor us and enabled us to transfer a certain\nportion of the economic risk of the loans or\nrelated debt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet the maximum amount of any remaining\nfunding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We\nseparately present information for\nconsolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       53       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       79       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  87    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       27       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       53       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities of the VIE, which includes the\nseller\u2019s interest and repurchased notes held\nby other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.2billion of assets and $\n551million of liabilities as of March 31,\n2022, and $ 2.2billion of assets and $\n568million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2021.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to government-\nsponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service\nthe transferred loans pursuant to the\nguidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an\ninvestor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and\nABS in our investment securities portfolio,\nwhich represent variable interests in the\nrespective securitization trusts from which\nthose securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either invest in securities issued by\nthe VIE and were not involved in the design of\nthe VIE or no transfers have occurred between\nthe VIE and us.

Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritizations involve the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain investments in qualified\naffordable housing projects using the\nproportional amortization method if certain\ncriteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the first three months of 2022\nand 2021, we recognized amortization of $\n161million and $ 156million, respectively, and\ntax credits of $ 250million and $ 258million,\nrespectively, associated with these\ninvestments within income tax provision. The\ncarrying value of our equity investments in\nthese qualified affordable housing projects\nwas $ 4.7billion as of both March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. We are periodically\nrequired to provide additional financial or\nother support during the period of the\ninvestments. Our liability for these unfunded\ncommitments was $ 1.7billion as of both March\n31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and is largely\nexpected to be paid from 2022 to 2024.\n                                              \n  89    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.7billion and $ 4.8billion as of March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The\ncreditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit and we do not provide\nadditional financial or other support other\nthan during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n12.2billion and $ 11.9billion as of March 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.2billion and $ 2.1billion as\nof March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively, are reflected on our\nconsolidated balance sheets in cash, loans\nheld for investment, and other assets. The\nliabilities are reflected in other\nliabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no\nrecourse to our general credit. We have not\nprovided additional financial or other support\nother than during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it.\n\nOther\n\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We are not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance. Our maximum exposure to these\nVIEs is limited to the investments on our\nconsolidated balance sheets of $ 367million\nand $ 383million as of March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively. The creditors\nof the other VIEs have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit.

and Accounting for\nDerivatives\nWe regularly enter into derivative\ntransactions to support our overall risk\nmanagement activities. Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency swaps to hedge, but we may\nalso use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We then enter\ninto derivative contracts with counterparties\nto economically hedge substantially all of our\nsubsequent exposures.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of AOCI. Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the forecasted transactions\nimpact earnings and presented in the same line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income\nas the earnings effect of the hedged items.\nOur cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps\nand floors that are intended to hedge the\nvariability in interest receipts or interest\npayments on some of our variable-rate\nfinancial assets or liabilities. We also enter\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  93    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that stems from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the\nIntercontinental Exchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH\nGroup (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs for our centrally\ncleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral\ncontracts, we enter into agreements directly\nwith our derivative counterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements, where applicable, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. We exchange collateral in\ntwo primary forms: variation margin, which\nmitigates the risk of changes in value due to\ndaily market movements and is exchanged daily,\nand initial margin, which mitigates the risk\nof potential future exposure of a derivative\nand is exchanged at the outset of a\ntransaction and adjusted daily. We exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin on our\ncleared derivatives. For uncleared bilateral\nderivatives, we exchange variation margin, and\nfrom September 2021 we exchange initial margin\non any new trades executed after September 1,\n2021, where such trades are in scope for\ninitial margin.\n\nThe amount of collateral exchanged for\nvariation margin is dependent upon the fair\nvalue of the derivative instruments as well as\nthe fair value of the pledged collateral and\nwill vary over time as market variables\nchange. The amount of the initial margin\nexchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation\nof initial margin exposure, as prescribed by\n1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators\u2019 margin\nrules for uncleared derivatives (\u201cPR Rules\u201d)\nor 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and\n2) the fair value of the pledged collateral;\nit will vary over time as market variables\nchange. When valuing collateral, an estimate\nof the variation in price and liquidity over\ntime is subtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d\nto discount the value of the collateral\npledged. Our exposure to derivative\ncounterparty credit risk, at any point in\ntime, is equal to the amount reported as a\nderivative asset on our balance sheet. The\nfair value of our derivatives is adjusted on\nan aggregate basis to take into consideration\nthe effects of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and any associated\ncollateral received or pledged. See Table 8.3\nfor our net exposure associated with\nderivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. We also clear exchange-traded\ninstruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures\ncommission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the\nintermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require\nthat we post initial and variation margin\nthrough our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-\npayment or default. Initial margin is required\nby CCPs as collateral against potential losses\non our exchange-traded and cleared derivative\ncontracts and variation margin is exchanged on\na daily basis to account for mark-to-market\nchanges in those derivative contracts. For\nCME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives,\nvariation margin cash payments are required to\nbe characterized as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with bilateral derivative\ncounterparties, where applicable, to mitigate\nthe risk of default. These bilateral\nagreements typically provide the right to\noffset exposure with the same counterparty and\nrequire the party in a net liability position\nto post collateral. Agreements with certain\nbilateral counterparties require both parties\nto maintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of uncleared derivatives exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\n                                              \n  94    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty. We also\nrecord debit valuation adjustments (\u201cDVAs\u201d) to\nadjust the fair values of our derivative\nliabilities to reflect the impact of our own\ncredit quality.\nBalance Sheet Presentation\nThe following table summarizes the notional\namounts and fair values of our derivative\ninstruments as of March 31, 2022 and December\n31, 2021, which are segregated by derivatives\nthat are designated as accounting hedges and\nthose that are not, and are further segregated\nby type of contract within those two\ncategories. The total derivative assets and\nliabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis\nto take into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand any associated cash collateral received or\npledged. Derivative assets and liabilities are\nincluded in other assets and other\nliabilities, respectively, on our consolidated\nbalance sheets, and their related gains or\nlosses are included in operating activities as\nchanges in other assets and other liabilities\nin the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTable 8.1: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nat Fair Value\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n             $      $             $      $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Does not reflect $ 10million and $\n11million recognized as a net valuation\nallowance on derivative assets and liabilities\nfor non-performance risk as of March 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021 , respectively.

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n              observable in the market.       \n  Level\u00a03:    Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d)               \n              methodologies or similar        \n              techniques.                     \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period. We consider all available\ninformation, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs.\nFor additional information on the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities on a\nrecurring basis, see \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value\nMeasurement\u201d in our 2021 Form 10-K .\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following table displays our assets and\nliabilities measured on our consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of March 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021.\nTable 11.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       4       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  105    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       9      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       6       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents balance sheet netting of\nderivative assets and liabilities, and related\npayables and receivables for cash collateral\nheld or placed with the same counterparty.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity or\ncredit spreads, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. In\naddition, an increase in default rates would\ngenerally be accompanied by a decrease in\nrecovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an\nincrease in liquidity spreads, and would lead\nto a decrease in the fair value measurement.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasureme nts\n\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess provides a funds credit for sources of\nfunds, such as deposits generated by our\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a funds charge for the use of\nfunds by each segment. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate third-party rates.

Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as automated teller\nmachine (\u201cATM\u201d) usage and overdrafts. Service\ncharges and other customer-related fees within\nour Commercial Banking business are mostly\nrelated to fees earned on treasury management\nand capital markets services. Other contract\nrevenue in our Credit Card business consists\nprimarily of revenue from our partnership\narrangements. Other contract revenue in our\nConsumer Banking business consists primarily\nof revenue earned on certain marketing and\npromotional events from our auto dealers.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is\nincluded in non-interest income in our\nconsolidated statements of income.\n                                              \n  112    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents revenue from\ncontracts with customers and a reconciliation\nto non-interest income by business segment for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022 and\n2021.\nTable 12.2: Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers and Reconciliation to Segment\nResults\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  71    $  \u2026    $   1    $  \u2026  \n         0       26       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         \u2026       17       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       -9       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  57    $  \u2026    $   0    $  \u2026  \n         0       44       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       19       1        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       21       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Some of our commercial investments\ngenerate tax-exempt income, tax credits or\nother tax benefits.

The contractual amount of these\ncommitments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to us should the counterparty draw\nupon the commitment. We generally manage the\npotential risk of unfunded lending commitments\nby limiting the total amount of arrangements,\nmonitoring the size and maturity structure of\nthese portfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of March 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.

We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of the loans.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair\nvalue option on new loss sharing agreements.\nUnrealized gains and losses are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income. For those loss sharing\nagreements entered into as of and prior to\nDecember 31, 2019, we amortize the liability\nrecorded at inception into non-interest income\nas we are released from risk of payment under\nthe loss sharing agreement and record our\nestimate of expected credit losses each period\nin provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The\nliability recognized on our consolidated\nbalance sheets for these loss sharing\nagreements was $ 88million and $ 90million as\nof March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.

None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of March\n31, 2022 are approximately $ 200million. Our\nreserve and reasonably possible loss estimates\ninvolve considerable judgment and reflect that\nthere is still significant uncertainty\nregarding numerous factors that may impact the\nultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding, our\nattempt to estimate a reasonably possible\nrange of loss beyond our current accrual\nlevels for some litigation matters based on\ncurrent information, it is possible that\nactual future losses will exceed both the\ncurrent accrual level and the range of\nreasonably possible losses disclosed here.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties involved in\nthese matters, especially those involving\ngovernmental agencies, and the very large or\nindeterminate damages sought in some of these\nmatters, there is significant uncertainty as\nto the ultimate liability we may incur from\nthese litigation matters and an adverse\noutcome in one or more of these matters could\nbe material to our results of operations or\ncash flows for any particular reporting\nperiod.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds settlements for its member\nbanks, and any settlements related to\nMasterCard-allocated losses have either\nalready been paid or are reflected in our\nreserves.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we\nare subject to numerous legal proceedings and\nother inquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We were named as a\ndefendant in approximately 75putative consumer\nclass action cases (primarily in U.S. courts\nwith cases also in Canadian courts) alleging\nharm from the Cybersecurity Incident and\nseeking various remedies, including monetary\nand injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege\nbreach of contract, negligence, violations of\nvarious privacy laws and a variety of other\nlegal causes of action. The U.S. consumer\nclass actions have been consolidated for\npretrial proceedings before a multi-district\nlitigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia,\nAlexandria Division. In the third quarter of\n2020, the MDL court denied in part and granted\nin part Capital One\u2019s motion to dismiss and\npermitted pretrial discovery to continue. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2021, the parties agreed\nto a settlement of the U.S. consumer class\naction cases for an amount within existing\nreserves. The parties are in the process of\nseeking the required court approval of the\nclass settlement.\n                                              \n  115    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nSecurities class action . The Company and\ncertain officers have also been named as\ndefendants in a putative class action pending\nin the MDL alleging violations of certain\nfederal securities laws in connection with\nstatements and alleged omissions in securities\nfilings relating to our information security\nstandards and practices. The complaint seeks\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief. The Company\u2019s motion\nto dismiss the case is pending.\n\nGovernmental inquiries . We have received\ninquiries and requests for information\nrelating to the Cybersecurity Incident from\nCongress, federal regulators, relevant\nCanadian regulators, the Department of\nJustice, and the offices of approximately\nfourteen state Attorneys General. We have\ncooperated with these offices and responded to\ntheir inquiries.\n\nIn August 2020, we entered into consent orders\nwith the Federal Reserve and the OCC resulting\nfrom regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity\nIncident and relating to ongoing enhancements\nof our cybersecurity and operational risk\nmanagement processes. We paid an $ 80million\npenalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the\nOCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement\ndid not contain a monetary penalty.\nTaxi Medallion Finance Investigations\nBeginning in 2019, we have received subpoenas\nfrom the New York Attorney General\u2019s office\nand from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nSouthern District of New York, Civil and\nCriminal Divisions, relating to investigations\nof the taxi medallion finance industry we\nexited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek,\namong other things, information regarding our\nlending counterparties and practices. We have\ncooperated with these investigations.\nU.K. PPI Litigation\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received\ncustomer complaints and regulatory claims\nrelating to PPI. COEP has materially resolved\nthe PPI complaints and regulatory claims\nreceived prior to the deadline. Some of the\nclaimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims\nprocess have subsequently initiated legal\nproceedings, seeking additional redress. We\nare responding to these proceedings as we\nreceive them.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  116    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.
