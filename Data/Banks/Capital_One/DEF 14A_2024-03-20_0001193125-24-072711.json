Our\nBoard is presenting the following twelve      \nnominees for election as directors at the 2024\nAnnual Stockholder Meeting. Each nominee is a \ncurrent Board member who was elected by       \nstockholders at the 2023 Annual Stockholder   \nMeeting, with the exception of Ms. Suni P.    \nHarford, who was appointed to the Board in    \naccordance with our Bylaws on February 28,    \n2024, with an effective date of April 1, 2024.\nEach nominee has consented to serve a one-    \nyearterm. Information about the proposed      \nnominees for election as directors is set     \nforth under \u201cOur Director Nominees\u201d beginning \non page 13. In the event a nominee becomes    \nunable to serve, or for good cause, will not  \nserve as a director, the Board may designate a\nsubstitute nominee or reduce the size of the  \nBoard. If the Board designates a substitute   \nnominee, proxies will be voted for the        \nelection of such substitute. As of the date of\nthis proxy statement, the Board has no reason \nto believe that any of the nominees will be   \nunable or unwilling to serve as a director.   \nThe nominees for election as directors at the \n2024 Annual Stockholder Meeting are:          \n                                              \n                        Dir\u2026            Oth\u2026  \n  Na\u2026    Age    Occ\u2026    Sin\u2026    Ind\u2026    Pub\u2026  \n                                        Boa\u2026  \n                Cha\u2026                          \n                and                           \n                Chi\u2026                          \n  Ri\u2026           Exe\u2026                          \n  D.      73    Off\u2026    1994    No         0  \n  Fa\u2026           Cap\u2026                          \n                One                           \n                Fin\u2026                          \n                Cor\u2026                          \n                Vice                          \n                Pre\u2026                          \n                Pro\u2026                          \n                Man\u2026                          \n  Ime           and                           \n  Ar\u2026     42    Head    2021    Yes        0  \n                of                            \n                Pro\u2026                          \n                at                            \n                Mes\u2026                          \n                Meta                          \n                For\u2026                          \n                Dir\u2026                          \n                Head                          \n                of                            \n                the                           \n                Ame\u2026                          \n  Ch\u2026           Fin\u2026                          \n  De\u2026     65    Ser\u2026    2021    Yes        2  \n                Pra\u2026                          \n                For\u2026                          \n                Sen\u2026                          \n                Adv\u2026                          \n                Bain                          \n                &                             \n                Com\u2026                          \n  Ann           For\u2026                          \n  Fr\u2026     70    Str\u2026    2004    Yes        2  \n  Ha\u2026           Con\u2026                          \n                Par\u2026                          \n                For\u2026                          \n  Su\u2026           Pre\u2026                          \n  P.      61    UBS     2024    Yes        0  \n  Ha\u2026           Ass\u2026                          \n                Man\u2026                          \n                For\u2026                          \n  Pe\u2026           Vice                          \n  Th\u2026     56    Pre\u2026    2016    Yes        3  \n  Ki\u2026           of                            \n                Tec\u2026                          \n                Ama\u2026                          \n                For\u2026                          \n                Gro\u2026                          \n                Chi\u2026                          \n  Eli     63    Ope\u2026    2019    Yes        0  \n  Le\u2026           Off\u2026                          \n                Qui\u2026                          \n                Pri\u2026                          \n                Bank                          \n                Pre\u2026                          \n                Chi\u2026                          \n                Exe\u2026                          \n  Fr\u2026           Off\u2026                          \n  Lo\u2026     52    and     2019    Yes        1  \n                Dir\u2026                          \n                F5                            \n                Net\u2026                          \n                Inc.                          \n                For\u2026                          \n                Cha\u2026                          \n                Pre\u2026                          \n  Pe\u2026           and                           \n  E.      67    Chi\u2026    2012    Yes        0  \n  Ra\u2026           Exe\u2026                          \n                Off\u2026                          \n                Nat\u2026                          \n                City                          \n                Cor\u2026                          \n                For\u2026                          \n                Sen\u2026                          \n                Adv\u2026                          \n                JP                            \n                Mor\u2026                          \n                Cha\u2026                          \n  Ei\u2026           &                             \n  Se\u2026     69    Co.;

an engaged and effective manner.\nOther Considerations For new candidates, the  \nGovernance and Nominating Committee also      \nconsiders the results of the candidate\u2019s      \ninterviews with directors and/or members of   \nsenior management and any background checks   \nthe Governance and Nominating Committee deems \nappropriate. In 2023, Capital One continued   \nits engagement with Spencer Stuart, a third-  \nparty director search firm, to identify and   \nevaluate potential director candidates based  \non the criteria and principles described      \nabove. When evaluating incumbent directors,   \nthe Governance and Nominating Committee also  \nconsiders the director\u2019s performance          \nthroughout the year, including the director\u2019s \nattendance, preparation for, and participation\nin Board and committee meetings, the          \ndirector\u2019s annual evaluation, including       \nfeedback received from fellow Board members,  \nand the director\u2019s willingness to serve for an\nadditional term, as further described in the  \nsection \u201cAnnual Assessment of Individual      \nDirector Nominees\u201d on page 31.                \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  20    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section I - Election of Directors (Item 1   \n  on Proxy                                    \n  Card)                                       \n                                              \nSkills and Experience of Our Director Nominees\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee and   \nthe Board regularly review the Board\u2019s        \nmembership in light of Capital One\u2019s business \nmodel and strategic goals and objectives, the \nregulatory environment, and financial market  \nconditions. In its review, the Governance and \nNominating Committee considers whether the    \nBoard continues to possess the appropriate mix\nof skills and experience to oversee the       \nCompany in achieving these goals, and may seek\nadditional directors as a result of this      \nreview. Our director nominees have the        \nrequisite experiences that, in the aggregate, \nmeet an articulated set of director skills    \nestablished by the Governance and Nominating  \nCommittee. These skills collectively allow our\ndirector nominees to effectively oversee the  \nCompany and create an engaged, effective, and \nstrategically oriented board.

Capital One is dedicated to strong\nand effective corporate governance that is    \ndesigned to provide the appropriate framework \nfor the Board to engage with and oversee the  \nmanagement of the

Robust and dynamic \ncorporate governance policies and practices   \nare the foundation of an effective and well-  \nfunctioning board and are vital to preserving \nthe trust of our stakeholders, including      \ncustomers, stockholders, regulators,          \nsuppliers, associates, our communities, and   \nthe general public. Information About Our     \nCorporate Governance Policies and Guidelines  \nThe Board has adopted Corporate Governance    \nGuidelines to formalize its governance        \npractices and provide its view of effective   \ngovernance. Our Corporate Governance          \nGuidelines embody many of our long-standing   \npractices, policies, and procedures, which    \ncollectively form a corporate governance      \nframework that promotes the long-term         \ninterests of our stockholders, promotes       \nresponsible decision-making and               \naccountability, and fosters a culture that    \nallows our Board and management to pursue     \nCapital One\u2019s strategic objectives. To        \nmaintain and enhance independent oversight,   \nour Board regularly reviews and refreshes its \ngovernance policies and practices in          \nconnection with changes in corporate strategy,\nthe regulatory environment, financial market  \nconditions, or other significant events, as   \nwell as in response to investor and other     \nstakeholder feedback and engagement. The Board\nhas also adopted Capital One\u2019s Code of        \nConduct, which applies to Capital One\u2019s       \ndirectors, executives and associates,         \nincluding Capital One\u2019s CEO, CFO, Principal   \nAccounting Officer, and other persons         \nperforming similar functions.

Recognizing the  \nimportance of independent perspectives to the \nBoard to balance the combined Chairman and CEO\nroles, Capital One appropriately maintains    \nstrong independent and effective oversight of \nour business and affairs through our Lead     \nIndependent Director; fully independent Board \ncommittees with independent chairs that       \noversee the Company\u2019s operations, risks,      \nperformance, and business strategy;           \nexperienced and committed directors; and      \nregular executive sessions. Our Lead          \nIndependent Director and our Independent      \nDirectors act as a strong counterbalance to   \nMr. Fairbank\u2019s combined roles of Chairman of  \nthe Board and CEO.

Director Independence Except for \nour CEO, who is the Company\u2019s founder, the    \nBoard has affirmatively determined that the   \nother nominees for election to our Board are  \nindependent under Capital One\u2019s Director      \nIndependence Standards (\u201cIndependence         \nStandards\u201d), which have been adopted by the   \nBoard as part of Capital One\u2019s Corporate      \nGovernance Guidelines. The Independence       \nStandards reflect the director independence   \nrequirements set forth in the New York Stock  \nExchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules and other applicable  \nlegal and regulatory rules, and also describe \ncertain categorical relationships that the    \nBoard has determined to be immaterial for     \npurposes of determining director independence.\nThe categorical relationships that the Board  \nhas deemed immaterial for purposes of         \ndetermining director independence are: (i)    \nrelationships between Capital One and an      \nentity where the director serves solely as a  \nnon-managementdirector; (ii) transactions     \nbetween Capital One and a director or a       \ndirector\u2019s immediate family member (or their  \nprimary business affiliations) that fall below\nthe numerical thresholds in the NYSE rules (or\ndo not otherwise preclude independence under  \nthose standards), and that are ordinary       \ncourse, on arm\u2019s-lengthmarket terms, and, in  \nthe case of extensions of credit, followed    \nusual underwriting procedures, present no more\nthan the normal collectability risk, or other \nunfavorable features and are in compliance    \nwith applicable legal and regulatory          \nrequirements; and (iii) discretionary         \ncontributions made by Capital One to not-for- \nprofitorganizations, foundations, or          \nuniversities in which a director (or immediate\nfamily member) serves as an executive officer \nthat in any single fiscal year within the last\nthree years do not exceed the greater of $1   \nmillion or 2% of that entity\u2019s consolidated   \ngross revenues. In making its independence    \nrecommendations, the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee and the Board evaluate information  \nobtained from non-managementdirectors\u2019        \nresponses to a questionnaire inquiring about  \ntheir relationships, transactions, or         \narrangements with Capital One, and those of   \ntheir immediate family members and primary    \nbusiness or charitable affiliations and other \npotential conflicts of interest. Following    \nthis review, the Board determined that each of\nthe director nominees (excluding our CEO) is  \nindependent under the Independence Standards. \nCapital One\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines,\nincluding information relating to the         \nIndependence Standards, are available at      \nwww.capitalone.com under \u201cInvestors,\u201d then    \n\u201cGovernance & Leadership,\u201d then               \n\u201cOrganizational and Governance Documents.\u201d    \nDirector Onboarding and Education The Company,\nin consultation with the Governance and       \nNominating Committee, has established director\nonboarding and continuing director education  \nprograms to support our directors in          \nfulfilling their responsibilities and to      \nassist them in keeping current on industry,   \ncorporate, regulatory, and other developments.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  28    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nAll new directors participate in the Company\u2019s\ndirector onboarding program which provides    \ntraining relating to the Company\u2019s values,    \nstrategic plans, accounting policies,         \nfinancial reporting, risk management, code of \nethics, key regulatory issues, competition,   \nand industry dynamics. As part of this        \nonboarding program, over a period of          \napproximately 18 months, new directors meet   \nwith members of senior management serving in  \nvarious roles and functions, as well as Board \ncommittee chairs, the Lead Independent        \nDirector, and individual directors, to review \nand discuss information about the Company, the\nbusiness, the boardroom, and individual       \ndirector roles and responsibilities.          \nAdditionally, new directors are assigned an   \nexperienced director to serve as a mentor to  \nfacilitate their onboarding to the Board and  \nthe Company. As we continue to enhance our    \ndirector onboarding experience, the Company   \ndeveloped committee onboarding programs, which\nare designed to facilitate and accelerate     \ndirectors\u2019 integration and contribution to the\ncommittees on which they serve. Our continuing\ndirector education program is designed to     \nprovide: (i) regular updates on external      \nopportunities for continuing education offered\nby applicable regulators, professional        \norganizations, and academic institutions; (ii)\ninternal director education programs; (iii)   \nvarious board-related publications; and (iv)  \naccess to various peer-to-peernetworks. Our   \ndirectors are also encouraged to pursue other \neducational opportunities, at the Company\u2019s   \nexpense, to enhance directors\u2019 ability to     \nperform their duties. Executive Sessions Our  \nIndependent Directors regularly convene       \nexecutive sessions led by the Lead Independent\nDirector at Board and committee meetings, as  \nneeded. The executive sessions allow the      \nIndependent Directors to discuss strategy, CEO\nand senior management performance and         \ncompensation, succession planning, Board      \neffectiveness, and other matters without      \nmanagement present. In 2023, the Board and    \neach Board committee met in executive session \nwithout members of management present. During \nthese executive sessions, Independent         \nDirectors have access to members of senior    \nmanagement upon request, including, but not   \nlimited to, the CEO, CFO, General Counsel and \nCorporate Secretary, Chief Risk Officers,     \nChief Audit Officer, Chief Information        \nSecurity Officer, Chief Technology Risk       \nOfficer, Chief Credit Review Officer, and     \nChief Compliance Officer. The Lead Independent\nDirector and/or any director may request      \nadditional executive sessions of the          \nIndependent Directors. Directors Are Actively \nEngaged Outside of Board Meetings Engagement  \noutside of Board meetings provides our        \ndirectors with additional insight into our    \nbusiness and industry.

In assessing their\nperformance, the Board and its committees take\na multi-year perspective to identify and      \nevaluate trends and assure themselves that    \nareas identified for improvement are addressed\nappropriately and in a timely manner. To      \nensure the process stays current and continues\nto generate rich insights, the Board follows a\ncyclical, programmatic approach when          \nconducting Board and committee evaluations.   \nThis approach includes regular, holistic      \nreviews of the evaluation framework,          \nmethodology, and form. While the Board and    \neach of its committees conducts a formal      \nevaluation annually, the Board considers its  \nperformance and that of its committees        \ncontinuously throughout the year and shares   \nfeedback with management. Seek Input Each     \nyear, the Lead Independent Director and       \ncommittee chairs, with input and support from \nmanagement and the Governance and Nominating  \nCommittee, develop a process to seek feedback \non the Board from directors and select members\nof management. Follow-Up A summary of the     \noverall evaluation results is shared with     \nmanagement to address any requests or         \nenhancements in practices that may be         \nwarranted. Committee chairs report on their   \nrespective evaluations to the full Board and  \nshare key actions with management for follow- \nup. Discuss The Lead Independent Director and \ncommittee chairs, with the assistance of      \nmanagement, leverage feedback to develop key  \nthemes that emerge from the feedback and lead \na robust discussion in their respective       \nexecutive sessions. Each year, the Board and  \nits committees may conduct their annual       \nevaluations through one or a combination of   \nevaluative approaches, including written      \nsurveys, individual director interviews, group\ndiscussions in executive session, and/or      \nengagement of a third-party facilitator. In   \n2023, the Company\u2019s General Counsel and       \nCorporate Secretary conducted individual      \ndirector interviews. As part of the Board\u2019s   \nself-evaluation process, directors consider   \nvarious topics related to Board composition,  \neffectiveness, structure, and performance and \nthe overall mix of director skills,           \nexperience, and background.

Annual Assessment of the Lead   \nIndependent Director To support the           \nIndependent Directors in selecting the Lead   \nIndependent Director, the Governance and      \nNominating Committee oversees an annual       \nprocess to evaluate the performance and       \neffectiveness of the Lead Independent         \nDirector.

The    \nBoard\u2019s Role in Corporate Oversight Capital   \nOne is dedicated to strong and effective      \ncorporate governance that provides the        \nappropriate framework for the Board to engage \nwith and oversee the Company. Our Board is    \naccountable for oversight of Capital One\u2019s    \nbusiness affairs and operations. In carrying  \nout this responsibility, among other things,  \nthe Board and its committees oversee          \nmanagement\u2019s development and implementation of\nthe Company\u2019s (i) corporate culture; (ii)     \ncorporate strategy; (iii) financial           \nperformance and associated risks; (iv) the    \nenterprise-wide risk management framework,    \nincluding cybersecurity and technology risk;  \n(v) succession planning for the Company\u2019s CEO \nand other key executives; (vi) compensation   \npolicies and practices; and (vii) policies,   \nprograms, and strategies related to ESG       \nmatters. The Board and its committees         \nregularly review and approve key governance   \npolicies and plans. Our Corporate Governance  \nGuidelines formalize the Company\u2019s key        \ncorporate governance practices and facilitate \nefficient and effective Board oversight. These\nGuidelines enable our Board to engage in      \nresponsible decision-making, work with        \nmanagement to pursue Capital One\u2019s strategic  \nobjectives and promote the long-term interests\nof our stockholders. Corporate Culture Capital\nOne believes that a strong, ethical corporate \nculture is a key element of sound and         \nsustainable corporate governance practices,   \nbeginning at the top with the CEO and other   \nsenior leadership. The Board plays a critical \nrole in supporting and overseeing Capital     \nOne\u2019s corporate culture, mission, values, and \nsetting the \u201ctone at the top\u201d by adopting     \npolicies, a code of ethics, a philosophy for  \nhiring, and compensation practices that       \npromote ethical behavior, compliance with laws\nand regulations, including those pertaining to\nconsumer protection and privacy, effective    \ninternal controls and risk management, and    \nsound governance.

Management, with      \nguidance from the Board, is responsible for   \ndeveloping, communicating, and implementing a \nstrategy that allows Capital One to: (i)      \ninvest in long-term capabilities and          \nopportunities; (ii) secure competitive,       \nendgame positions in our key businesses; (iii)\nattract and retain customers; (iv) grow       \nresiliently; (v) promote ethical behavior and \ncompliance with applicable laws and           \nregulations; (vi) withstand economic stress   \nand market volatility; and (vii) adhere to the\nBoard\u2019s established risk appetite. These      \nstrategies allow us to deliver long-term value\nto our stockholders while helping customers   \nsucceed, associates grow, and communities     \nthrive. The development, vetting, and         \ncommunication of Capital One\u2019s strategy is an \nongoing, iterative process that involves the  \nBoard, the CEO, the Presidents of our lines of\nbusiness, the CFO, the General Counsel and    \nCorporate Secretary, the Chief Enterprise Risk\nOfficer, the Chief Audit Officer, all other   \nExecutive Committee members, our Corporate    \nStrategy team, and other leaders across the   \nenterprise. Each year, the Board participates \nin a dedicated long-term strategy meeting     \nwhere the CEO and key senior leaders present  \nthe Company\u2019s top strategic initiatives to the\nBoard. The Board provides effective challenge,\nfeedback, and input that guides the Company\u2019s \nstrategic priorities and investments.         \nFollowing the meeting, the Board reviews      \nassessments of the Company\u2019s strategic        \ninitiatives, performed by the independent risk\nmanagement and internal audit functions, and  \napproves the Company\u2019s strategic plan.        \nFurthermore, the independent risk management  \nfunction regularly provides the Risk Committee\nwith, among other things, reporting on the    \nCompany\u2019s performance against its risk        \nappetite metrics, assessments of the external \nenvironment and the Company\u2019s positioning in  \nthe context of key risk categories. The Board \nregularly reviews the financial, competitive, \nand risk performance of the Company and       \nreceives updates on key strategic initiatives.\nEach line of business also reports to the     \nBoard the progress on their strategic and     \nfinancial initiatives on an annual basis.     \nCapital One assesses performance against      \nstrategic initiatives by reviewing the        \nCompany\u2019s financial performance, competitive  \npositioning and market share, technology      \ncapabilities, performance against risk        \nappetites and limits, customer satisfaction   \nand advocacy scores, talent management, system\navailability and downtime statistics, risk    \nratings and measurements, market-based        \nindicators, and other quantitative and        \nqualitative performance assessments.

The Board also regularly     \nengages management in discussions regarding   \nfinancial performance and trajectory, capital \nallocation, strategy implementation, risk     \nmitigation plans, and other matters affecting \nthe Company\u2019s strategy, as appropriate.       \nFinancial Performance and Associated Risks The\nBoard oversees the Company\u2019s financial        \nperformance by reviewing with management, on a\nregular basis, the Company\u2019s quarterly and    \nannual financial statements. The Audit        \nCommittee oversees the integrity of the       \nCompany\u2019s financial statements by, among other\nthings, obtaining independent assurance as to \nthe completeness and accuracy of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial statements from an independent      \nregistered public accounting firm, whose      \nqualifications, independence, and performance,\nit reviews on an annual basis. The Audit      \nCommittee also oversees the integrity of the  \nCompany\u2019s internal controls over financial    \nreporting by, among other things, reviewing   \nperiodic assessments of the adequacy and      \neffectiveness of the Company\u2019s financial      \ncontrols performed by both the Company\u2019s      \nindependent registered public accounting firm \nand the Company\u2019s internal audit function. In \naddition, the Board, either directly or       \nthrough the Risk Committee, plays an integral \nrole in the oversight of capital management,  \nfunding of the balance sheet, liquidity and   \nmarket risk management, management of the     \ninvestment portfolio management, and the      \nmanagement of other asset and liability risk  \nmatters. Enterprise-Wide Risk Management      \nFramework Effective risk management and       \ncontrol processes are critical to our safety  \nand soundness, our ability to predict and     \nmanage the challenges that Capital One and the\nfinancial services industry face and,         \nultimately, our long-term corporate success.  \nThe enterprise-wide risk management framework \ndefines the Board\u2019s appetite for risk taking  \nand enables senior management to understand,  \nmanage and report on risk. The risk management\nframework is implemented enterprise-wide and  \nincludes seven major risk categories:         \ncompliance, credit, liquidity, market,        \noperational, reputation, and strategic. The   \nBoard\u2019s role in risk oversight of Capital One \nis consistent with its leadership structure,  \nwith the CEO and other members of senior      \nmanagement having responsibility for assessing\nand managing Capital One\u2019s risk exposure on a \nday-to-daybasis, and the Board and its        \ncommittees providing oversight in connection  \nwith these efforts. The full Board, with the  \nsupport of its committees, oversees the entire\nenterprise-wide risk management framework for \nthe Company. The Board\u2019s oversight focuses on \nour material risks and any notable emerging   \nrisks to ensure that Capital One\u2019s risk       \nmanagement is adequate. The Chair of the Risk \nCommittee, in collaboration with the Lead     \nIndependent Director, helps ensure that the   \nBoard has appropriate discussions on risk     \ntopics. The Risk Committee is responsible for \nreviewing and recommending to the Board for   \napproval certain risk appetites taking into   \naccount the Company\u2019s structure, risk profile,\ncomplexity, activities, size, and other       \nappropriate risk-related factors. The Risk    \nCommittee considers both current risk,        \nincluding timeframes reflected by those risks,\nas well as emerging risks and future threats. \nAt the management level, senior management    \ncommittees serve as governance forums for the \nCEO, Chief Risk Officers, and other members of\nsenior management to receive and discuss risk \nmanagement information, reports, views, and   \nescalated matters from the lines of business, \nthe independent risk management function, the \ninternal audit function, and other areas of   \nthe Company. Enterprise-wide risk management  \nis generally the responsibility of the Chief  \nRisk Officers. The Chief Enterprise Risk      \nOfficer has accountability for proposing risk \nappetites, limits, and reporting levels       \nrelated to compliance, operational,           \nreputation, and strategic risk, and the Chief \nCredit and Financial Risk Officer has         \naccountability for proposing risk appetites,  \nlimits, and reporting levels related to       \ncredit, liquidity, and market risk. The Chief \nEnterprise Risk Officer is also responsible   \nfor ensuring that the Company has an overall  \nenterprise risk framework and that it         \nroutinely assesses and reports on enterprise  \nlevel risks. The Chief Risk Officers report   \nboth to the CEO and to the Risk Committee, and\nupdate the Risk Committee regularly on a      \nvariety of risk matters, including the        \nCompany\u2019s performance against risk metrics, in\naddition to ad hoc reports on emerging risks. \nThe Board and its committees meet with outside\nadvisors periodically, as appropriate and     \nnecessary, and are empowered to consult at any\ntime with outside advisors to support their   \noversight responsibilities. The Audit         \nCommittee also plays an important risk        \noversight function, and oversees elements of  \ncompliance, including                         \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  34    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nfinancial reporting that encompasses          \ndisclosure controls and procedures. The       \nCompensation Committee oversees compensation  \npolicies and practices to ensure balanced     \nrisk-taking in our compensation programs,     \npractices, and decisions as further described \nin \u201cCompensation Policies and Practices\u201d      \nbelow. Cybersecurity and Technology Risk As a \nfinancial services company entrusted with the \nsafeguarding of sensitive information,        \nincluding sensitive personal information, we  \nbelieve that a strong enterprise cybersecurity\nprogram is a vital component of effectively   \nmanaging risks related to the confidentiality,\nintegrity, availability and security of our   \ndata. The Risk Committee of the Board is      \nresponsible for overseeing our enterprise risk\nmanagement framework, including cybersecurity \nand technology risk. At least quarterly, the  \nRisk Committee receives reports from          \nmanagement on our cybersecurity and technology\nrisk profile, key enterprise cybersecurity    \ninitiatives, and on any identified significant\nthreats or incidents, or new risk             \ndevelopments. The Risk Committee coordinates  \nwith the full Board regarding the strategic   \nimplications of cyber and technology risks. At\nleast annually, the Board, either directly or \nthrough the Risk Committee, reviews the       \nCompany\u2019s technology strategy with the Chief  \nInformation Officer; reviews the Company\u2019s    \ninformation security program with the Chief   \nInformation Security Officer and Chief        \nTechnology Risk Officer; and approves the     \nCompany\u2019s information security program. In    \naddition, the Risk Committee and the Board    \nparticipate in periodic cybersecurity         \neducation sessions. Succession Planning       \nPursuant to our Corporate Governance          \nGuidelines, the Board is responsible for      \nmaintaining a succession plan for the CEO and \ncertain senior executive positions. A planning\nprocess has been developed and maintained to  \nidentify, develop, and assess successors to   \nthe CEO and such positions. The Board reviews \nand updates these succession plans at least   \nannually, including the most recent review and\nupdate in late 2023. Our Board believes that  \nthe directors and the CEO should work together\non executive succession planning and that the \nentire Board should be involved. Each year, as\npart of the succession planning process, our  \nCEO provides the Board with recommendations   \non, and evaluations of, potential CEO         \nsuccessors. The Board considers a number of   \nfactors such as experience, skills,           \ncompetencies, diversity, and potential in its \nreview of the senior executive team to assess \nwhich executives possess or can develop the   \nattributes that the Board believes are        \nnecessary to lead and achieve the Company\u2019s   \ngoals. Among other steps taken to promote this\nprocess throughout the year, executives one   \nand two levels below the CEO often attend     \nBoard meetings and present to the Board,      \nproviding the Board with numerous             \nopportunities to interact with our senior     \nmanagement and assess their leadership        \ncapabilities. Additionally, each line of      \nbusiness, independent risk management,        \ninternal audit, and finance functions engage  \nin succession planning for key roles at least \nonce per year. The Chief Human Resources      \nOfficer reviews these line of business and    \nfunctional area succession plans. In addition \nto the general succession plan, our Board     \nproactively reviewed plans for temporary      \nemergency successors across key roles in 2023.\nThe temporary emergency succession plan is    \nintended to identify the leaders who can      \nassume the responsibilities in the immediate  \nshort-term to ensure business continuity, day-\nto-daymanagement of the team and business for \nour senior management and other key roles. Our\nBoard also has established steps to address   \nemergency CEO succession planning for an      \nunplanned CEO succession event. Our emergency \nCEO succession planning is intended to enable \nour Company to respond to an unexpected CEO   \ntransition by continuing our Company\u2019s safe   \nand sound operation and minimizing potential  \ndisruption or loss of continuity to our       \nCompany\u2019s operations and strategy. The Board  \nreviews annually the CEO\u2019s emergency successor\nrecommendations. As a result of this evergreen\nprocess, there is a named CEO emergency       \nsuccessor should the CEO become unexpectedly  \nunable to serve. Compensation Policies and    \nPractices The Compensation Committee oversees \nall of our compensation policies and          \npractices, including our incentive            \ncompensation policies and practices, with a   \nview toward ensuring that such policies and   \npractices encourage balanced risk-taking, are \ncompatible with effective controls and risk   \nmanagement, align with our business           \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            35  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nstrategy, and enable the Company to attract   \nand retain top talent, especially in key job  \nfunctions. Every two years, the Compensation  \nCommittee reviews and approves the Incentive  \nCompensation Governance Policy, which applies \nto all Company associates and governs         \nincentive compensation decisions. The         \nIncentive Compensation Governance Policy      \nprovides the framework for oversight of the   \ndesign of incentive compensation programs. In \nsetting executive compensation, the           \nCompensation Committee assesses each of the   \nNEOs against one or more performance          \nobjectives specifically designed to evaluate  \nthe degree to which the NEOs balanced risks   \ninherent in their specific roles. The         \nCompensation Committee also implements        \nadditional risk-balancing features for certain\nequity awards, as described in more detail in \nthe \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d    \nbeginning on page 63. In addition, the        \nCompensation Committee reviews the Company\u2019s  \nNEO and other senior executive compensation   \nprograms, as well as any other material       \nincentive compensation programs, plans or     \nagreements. During these reviews, the         \nCompensation Committee discusses the Company\u2019s\nmost significant risks, including the         \nCompany\u2019s status with respect to managing     \nthose risks and the relationship of those     \nrisks to compensation programs. The review    \nincludes discussion and analysis of risk-     \nbalancing features embedded in these incentive\ncompensation programs and other actions taken \nby the Company to appropriately balance risk  \nand achieve conformance with regulatory       \nguidance. The Compensation Committee also     \ndiscusses these programs with the Company\u2019s   \nChief Enterprise Risk Officer, Chief Human    \nResources Officer, and the Compensation       \nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation          \nconsultant, as appropriate.

We use \na variety of waste, recycling, and compost    \nhaulers across our geographic footprint to    \nmanage and track waste. Inconsistencies in the\noperational practices and estimation          \nmethodologies among these vendors has         \nchallenged our ability to obtain comparable   \nand actionable data. We are working with our  \nwaste brokers on potential solutions and      \nanticipate disclosing a waste-related goal and\ndata in the future. We remain committed to    \nwaste reduction, and plan to continue our     \nexisting efforts to increase landfill         \ndiversion and minimize our procurement of     \nsingle-useitems across our campuses in the    \nmeantime. Highlights of our environmental     \nsustainability efforts include:               \n                                              \n       Operational Emissions. Operational     \n       emissions are inclusive of our direct  \n       GHG emissions (Scope 1), the indirect  \n       GHG emissions associated with          \n       purchased electricity, steam and heat  \n       (Scope 2) and the GHG emissions        \n  \u220e    associated with our supply chain       \n       (Scope 3, Categories 1-14). Category   \n       15 financed emissions are covered      \n       separately below. We continue to       \n       invest in efforts to improve our       \n       measurement and controls and deliver   \n       on our operational emissions goals.    \n                                              \nIn 2023, we evolved our methodologies to make \nour operational emissions estimates more      \nprecise and actionable. For example, we       \nincreased the proportion of our Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions that are calculated using billed    \nutility data, decreasing our reliance on      \nconsumption estimates. We also engaged with   \nseveral                                       \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  52    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nof our largest suppliers to understand key    \nsources of emissions in their value chain,    \ncollect higher quality data, and move toward  \nthe use of emissions factors more tailored to \nour business activities. This allows us to    \ncontinue moving beyond exclusively using      \nindustry-level estimates for our supply chain \nemissions and account for local procurement   \ndecisions and supplier-specific               \ndecarbonization progress. Over time, this     \ninvestment in our emissions methodology will  \nmake it easier to track the impact of our     \nactions. To support Scope 1 and 2 emissions   \nreductions in 2023, we invested in greater    \nenergy efficiency and lower-carbon solutions  \nfor our emissions-generating assets. For      \nexample, we have begun replacing higher global\nwarming potential (\u201cGWP\u201d) refrigerants with   \nlower GWP alternatives in order to reduce     \nemissions from any unintended refrigerant     \nleaks. We have also continued to invest in the\nefficiency of our lighting, heating and       \ncooling systems, and began assessments in 2023\nto understand the electrification potential of\nnatural gas assets nearing end of life. To    \nsupport our goal of achieving greater         \nlocation-aligned procurement across our       \noperational footprint, we installed two       \nadditional on-sitesolar systems and are       \ncontinuing to evaluate other renewable energy \nprocurement options for our own electricity   \nneeds. Given that nearly half of our Scope 3  \nemissions from purchased goods and services   \ncome from electricity used by our suppliers,  \nwe are exploring ways to support the uptake of\nrenewable energy among our suppliers to       \naccelerate progress toward our Scope 3        \n(Categories 1-14)emissions reduction goal.    \n                                              \n       Internal Price on Carbon. In 2020,     \n       Capital One established an internal    \n       price on carbon of $15.00 per metric   \n       ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, or   \n       CO2e for Scope 1, Scope 2 and          \n  \u220e    verified Scope 3 (Categories 1-14)     \n       emissions. This carbon fee creates a   \n       monetary value on the GHG emissions    \n       in our carbon footprint, which can     \n       enable greater visibility and          \n       incentive alignment in the future.     \n                                              \nThe fee has supported a dedicated budget to   \nfund our carbon reduction efforts and         \nsustainability initiatives. These initiatives \nhave included energy efficiency improvements  \nlike LED light installations, renewable on-   \nsiteenergy production including solar panel   \ninstallation, and water conservation efforts. \nWe are currently evaluating our price of      \ncarbon and related processes and expect to    \nupdate them in 2024.                          \n                                              \n       Financed Emissions. Financed           \n       emissions are the GHG emissions        \n       associated with our lending            \n       activities and investments (Scope 3,   \n       Category 15). In 2023, we continued    \n       to refine our methodologies, data and  \n       controls and identify the long-term    \n       processes and infrastructure required  \n  \u220e    to support potential future            \n       disclosures of these emissions. To     \n       support these efforts, we joined the   \n       Partnership for Carbon Accounting      \n       Financials (\u201cPCAF\u201d), an industry-led   \n       initiative that is developing          \n       standards to enable financial          \n       institutions to measure implied        \n       emissions of loans and investments.    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Consumer Climate Strategy.

We have also instituted several climate-\nspecific governance processes at both the     \nenterprise and line of business levels, which \nroll up through our broader enterprise ESG    \ngovernance structure. The Board is actively   \nengaged in the development of Capital One\u2019s   \nenterprise climate strategy and risk          \nmanagement, including climate-related goals   \nand targets. The Board receives updates from  \nmanagement on our enterprise-wide climate     \nstrategy and risk management at least once a  \nyear. In 2021, we named a Senior Advisor to   \nthe CEO with previous senior management       \nexperience in risk, strategy, and line-of-    \nbusinessleadership at Capital One, to serve as\nthe Head of Climate for the enterprise. The   \nHead of Climate is responsible for the        \nformulation and coordination of our enterprise\nclimate strategy. Capital One\u2019s senior        \nleadership also integrates climate            \nconsiderations into individual line of        \nbusiness strategies where appropriate. Climate\nand other ESG-relatedissues are also discussed\nin existing senior management committees at   \nCapital One. Climate Risk Management Capital  \nOne looks at how risks, including climate-    \nrelated risks, could impact our Company across\nseven risk categories each quarter. We also   \nidentify emerging risks that may occur across \na longer time horizon, happen in the future,  \nor have a potential impact that is difficult  \nto predict. The seven risk categories we use  \nto evaluate climate risks are consistent with \nthose we use to evaluate and manage all of our\nenterprise risks: credit, operational,        \nstrategic, reputational, market, liquidity,   \nand compliance risks. As we continue to       \nenhance climate risk management capabilities, \nand in alignment with emerging regulatory     \nguidance, we are conducting climate-specific  \nscenario analysis to better understand the    \nlong-term impact of climate change on our     \nportfolios. We will also continue to improve  \nour risk identification process to take       \nclimate-related risks into consideration when \nmaking decisions across the enterprise.

Director Compensation    \nProcedures The Compensation Committee annually\nreviews the compensation program for Capital  \nOne\u2019s non-managementdirectors. FW Cook        \nprovides competitive compensation data and    \ndirector compensation program recommendations \nto the Compensation Committee. The competitive\ncompensation data includes information        \nregarding the compensation (cash, equity, and \nother benefits) of the non-managementdirectors\nwithin Capital One\u2019s peer comparator group.   \nThe Compensation Committee considers this     \ninformation and FW Cook\u2019s recommendations, and\nfinalizes a proposed director compensation    \nstructure for review and approval by the full \nBoard, typically in the second quarter of each\nyear. See the discussion under \u201cCompensation  \nCommittee Consultant\u201d beginning on page 42 for\nfurther information on the role and           \nresponsibilities of FW Cook and \u201cPeer Groups\u201d \nbeginning on page 99 for further information  \non the selection of the Company\u2019s peer        \ncomparator group. Based on its review of      \ncompetitive market data and guidance from FW  \nCook in the second quarter of 2023, the       \nCompensation Committee determined that the    \nCompany\u2019s director compensation program meets \nthe objectives listed above. Director         \nCompensation Structure On May 4, 2023, the    \nBoard approved a compensation program for     \nCapital One\u2019s non-managementdirectors for the \nperiod from May 4, 2023 through our 2024      \nAnnual Stockholder Meeting that is similar to \nthe program for the preceding year. The       \ncompensation program consists of an annual    \ncash retainer of $100,000 for service on the  \nBoard. In addition, directors receive annual  \ncash retainers for committee service and for  \nservice as committee chairs and Lead          \nIndependent Director.

The increase to the annual cash\nretainer was in recognition of the demands of \nservice for Board members and to further align\ncompensation for such service with the        \nCompany\u2019s peer comparator group. In addition, \neach non-managementdirector serving on May 4, \n2023, received on such date an award of 2,453 \nRSUs under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan with \na grant date fair value of $210,050, or $85.63\nper share. The RSUs were valued based on the  \nfair market value of a share of Capital One   \ncommon stock on the date of grant and vest one\nyear from the date of grant, with the delivery\nof the underlying shares deferred until the   \ndirector\u2019s service with the Board ends. Other \nBenefits Under the Capital One Financial      \nCorporation Non-EmployeeDirectors Deferred    \nCompensation Plan (\u201cNEDDCP\u201d), non-            \nmanagementdirectors who reside in the United  \nStates may voluntarily defer all or a portion \nof their cash compensation and receive        \ndeferred income benefits. Participants in the \nplan can direct their individual cash         \ndeferrals among ten investments available     \nthrough the plan. Beginning in 2023, under the\nNEDDCP, non-managementdirectors who have met  \ntheir stock ownership requirement may also    \nelect to defer their entire annual RSU award  \nissued for their service as a director. Non-  \nmanagementdirectors participating in the      \nNEDDCP receive their deferred cash income     \nbenefits and/or deferred stock benefits when  \nthey cease serving as directors, upon certain \nother distribution events specified in the    \nplan, or at such earlier time as authorized by\nthe Compensation Committee, in cash or in     \nCapital One common stock, respectively. Upon a\nchange of control, Capital One will pay each  \ndirector within 30 days of the change of      \ncontrol. Those who elect to defer cash will   \nreceive a lump sum cash payment equal to the  \ndirector\u2019s cash account balance as of the date\nof the change of control. Those who elect to  \ndefer RSUs will receive shares of Capital One \ncommon stock or cash for each RSU in an amount\nequal to the per-shareamount paid to Capital  \nOne\u2019s stockholders in connection with the     \nchange of control. Capital One also offers    \nnon-managementdirectors the opportunity to    \ndirect a contribution of up to $10,000        \nannually from Capital One to charitable       \norganization(s) of their choice. All eleven   \nnon-managementdirectors who served during 2023\nelected to make such a charitable contribution\nin 2023. In addition, all directors who served\nduring 2023 were eligible, and six directors  \nelected, to participate in a Capital One      \nbroad-based charitable contribution program,  \nwhich is available to Capital One associates, \nunder which Capital One made a contribution of\n$5,000 per director to a charitable           \norganization of their choice. Directors also  \noccasionally have access to certain Capital   \nOne-sponsoredevents for which they receive    \ntickets. Directors also receive reimbursements\nfor certain board-related expenses, including \nexternal educational seminars and travel-     \nrelated costs incurred to attend Board        \nmeetings.

While the    \nvote is non-binding,the Board values the      \nopinions that stockholders express through    \ntheir votes and in any additional dialogue.   \nThe Board will consider the outcome of the    \nvote when making future compensation          \ndecisions. As discussed in the \u201cCompensation  \nDiscussion and Analysis\u201d section beginning on \npage 63, our Board has provided compensation  \nprograms for the CEO and the other NEOs that  \nare competitive with the market, performance- \nbased, and transparent and that align with our\nstockholders\u2019 interests over multiple time    \nhorizons. Our CEO\u2019s and other NEOs\u2019           \ncompensation programs have consisted primarily\nof performance-based incentive opportunities, \nincluding multiple types of equity instruments\nwith multi-year vesting schedules. The        \nultimate value of these equity-based awards is\nsubject to Capital One\u2019s sustained performance\nover time, both on an absolute basis and      \nrelative to our peers. For the 2023           \nperformance year, approximately 83% of the    \nCEO\u2019s total compensation is equity-based and  \nat-riskto the Company\u2019s performance and 100%  \nof his compensation is deferred for a three-  \nyear period. As discussed under \u201cNEO          \nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 90, under the \n2023 NEO compensation program applicable to   \nour other NEOs, approximately 49% of total    \ncompensation is provided through equity-based \nvehicles which were all at-riskbased on the   \nCompany\u2019s performance and subject to vesting  \nover multiple time horizons. Additional       \ninformation relevant to your vote can be found\nin the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d \nsection on pages 63 to 103 and the \u201cNamed     \nExecutive Officer Compensation\u201d section on    \npages 104 to 122.

The Plan permits the  \npurchase of the Company\u2019s common stock through\na percentage of payroll deductions throughout \nthe calendar year. Upon initial adoption of   \nthe ASPP, the Company reserved 3,000,000      \nshares of Capital One common stock for        \nassociate purchases. In February 2008, the    \nBoard approved an increase in the number of   \nshares reserved for issuance to 8,000,000,    \nwhich was approved by stockholders in April   \n2008. The Plan was subsequently amended in May\n2012, upon approval by the Board and          \nstockholders, to increase the number of shares\nreserved for issuance to 18,000,000. The Plan \nwas most recently submitted for approval and  \napproved by stockholders on May 8, 2017, in   \norder to increase the number of shares        \nreserved for issuance under the Plan to       \n33,000,000. The Plan was further amended by   \nthe Board effective January 1, 2018, July 21, \n2018, and January 1, 2021 to make various     \nadministrative changes including a reduction  \nin the annual associate contribution cap and  \nreducing the company match percentage. The    \nBoard is recommending an amendment and        \nrestatement to the ASPP to request approval of\nan additional 20,000,000 shares to be reserved\nunder the ASPP, for a total of 53,000,000     \nreserve shares. These shares may consist of   \nnewly issued shares, treasury shares, shares  \nacquired on the open market or any combination\nthereof. The following description of the ASPP\nis not intended to be complete and is         \nqualified in its entirety by the complete text\nof the ASPP, which is attached to this proxy  \nstatement as Appendix B. Stockholders are     \nurged to read the ASPP in its entirety.       \nSummary of Material Provisions of the ASPP    \nAdministration The ASPP is administered by the\nCompensation Committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d), which   \nmust consist of not less than two members     \nappointed by the Board, unless the Board      \nappoints another committee to administer the  \nplan. Such Committee has the authority to take\nany and all actions necessary to implement the\nASPP and to interpret the ASPP, to prescribe, \namend and rescind rules and regulations       \nrelating to the ASPP, and to make all other   \ndeterminations necessary or advisable in      \nadministering the ASPP. All of such actions,  \ninterpretations and determinations shall be   \nfinal and binding upon all persons.           \nEligibility The basis for participation in the\nASPP is that the associate must be actively   \nemployed by the Company or a participating    \nsubsidiary, and customarily paid through the  \nCompany\u2019s regular payroll. As of December 31, \n2023, there were approximately 47,500         \nassociates eligible to participate in the     \nASPP. Purchase of Shares Each eligible        \nassociate may elect regular, monthly payroll  \ndeductions of up to 15% of the associate\u2019s    \nbase compensation to be used to purchase      \nshares of the Company\u2019s common stock at       \nmonthly intervals (or at such                 \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  60    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Approval and Adoption of the    \n  Capital                                     \n  One Financial Corporation Amended and       \n  Restated                                    \n  2002 Associate Stock Purchase Plan (Item 3  \n  on                                          \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nother times as determined by the plan         \nadministrator). The total amount of monthly   \npayroll deductions may not exceed $25,000 in  \nany calendar year. A participating associate  \nmay generally elect to increase, decrease, or \neliminate their regular payroll deduction at  \nany time. Shares of the Company\u2019s common stock\nare purchased under the ASPP at the end of    \neach month (\u201cPurchase Date\u201d), or at such other\ntimes as determined by the plan administrator.\nMatching Contribution; Purchase Price Each    \nassociate who participates in the ASPP will   \nreceive a matching contribution from the      \nCompany equal to 15% of the amount of such    \nassociate\u2019s contributions to the ASPP. This   \nmatching contribution is combined with the    \nassociate\u2019s contributions and used to purchase\nthe Company\u2019s common stock under the ASPP at a\npurchase price equal to the fair market value \nof the Company\u2019s common stock on the          \napplicable Purchase Date. Effect of           \nTermination of Employment If an eligible      \nassociate\u2019s employment is terminated for any  \nreason (including death), any amount withheld \nprior to such termination will be used to     \npurchase shares on the next Purchase Date.    \nChange in Capital Structure In the event of a \nstock dividend, spin-off,stock split or       \ncombination of shares, recapitalization or    \nmerger in which the Company is the surviving  \ncorporation or other change in the Company\u2019s  \ncommon stock (including, but not limited to,  \nthe creation or issuance to stockholders      \ngenerally of rights, options or warrants for  \nthe purchase of common stock or preferred     \nstock of the Company), the number and kind of \nshares of stock or securities of the Company  \nto be subject to the ASPP, the maximum number \nof shares or securities that may be delivered \nunder the ASPP, the purchase price and other  \nrelevant provisions shall be appropriately    \nadjusted by the Committee, whose determination\nshall be binding on all persons. Amendment and\nTermination The Committee in its sole         \ndiscretion may at any time amend the ASPP in  \nany respect provided that such amendment is in\ncompliance with all applicable laws and       \nregulations and the requirements of any       \nnational securities exchange on which shares  \nof the Company\u2019s common stock are then traded.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences The      \nfollowing tax discussion is a brief summary of\ncurrent U.S. federal income tax law. The      \ndiscussion is intended solely for general     \ninformation and does not make specific        \nrepresentations to any associate participating\nin the ASPP. The discussion does not address  \nstate, local or foreign income tax rules or   \nother U.S. tax provisions, such as estate or  \ngift taxes. An associate\u2019s particular         \nsituation may be such that some variation of  \nthe basic rules is applicable to them. In     \naddition, the federal income tax laws and     \nregulations frequently have been revised and  \nmay be changed again at any time. Therefore,  \neach recipient is urged to consult a tax      \nadvisor before exercising any award or before \ndisposing of any shares acquired under the    \nplan both with respect to federal income tax  \nconsequences as well as any foreign, state or \nlocal tax consequences. On the date of each   \npayroll contribution, an associate will have  \nordinary income equal to the amount of the    \nCompany-paid match described above. The       \nassociate\u2019s capital gains holding period will \ncommence on each Purchase Date. We are        \nentitled to a deduction for amounts taxed as  \nordinary income to an associate. ASPP Benefits\nFuture benefits available under the ASPP are  \nsubject to the participation level of our     \nassociates and to the Company\u2019s stock price at\nthe time of any purchases and therefore are   \nnot determinable at this time.

The Committee seeks to \ndirectly link the compensation of the NEOs    \nwith the Company\u2019s performance and the        \nexecutives\u2019 contributions to that performance.\nIn 2023, Capital One delivered strong         \nfinancial results and made significant        \nprogress on our long-term strategic           \ninitiatives enabled by years of strategic     \nchoices and our investments in talent,        \ntechnology, and risk management. Strong       \nrevenue growth and credit results, coupled    \nwith disciplined expense management, drove    \nstrong profitability and capital generation.  \nOur Domestic Card business delivered strong   \npurchase volume, loan and revenue growth while\nmanaging the post-pandemic dynamics of an     \nevolving consumer credit environment. We      \ncontinued to expand our national Retail       \nBanking Business and grow deposits and        \nrevenue. Our Auto Finance and Commercial Bank \nbusinesses also demonstrated resilience and   \ndelivered strong results amid challenging     \nindustry headwinds. In addition, Capital One\u2019s\nstock price ended 2023 at $131.12, up 41% from\nyear-end2022 and outperforming the KBW Bank   \nIndex by 46 percentage points. Capital One\u2019s  \nTSR, which includes the combined effect of    \nshare price change plus common dividends, was \n44.3% in 2023. Diluted EPS for the year was   \n$11.95 and we returned $1.5 billion of capital\nto stockholders, as we completed $600 million \nin common share repurchases and paid $935     \nmillion in common dividends. Net revenue      \nincreased by 7.4% over 2022 to $36.8 billion. \nWe took steps to manage operating expenses and\nour operating efficiency ratio (1)rose        \nslightly to 44.3%, while our adjusted         \noperating efficiency ratio (2)(3)improved 99  \nbps to 43.5%. Our marketing investments       \nremained relatively flat at $4 billion as we  \ncontinued to lean into attractive and         \nresilient growth across our Card and Retail   \nBanking franchises. Our efficiency ratio      \n(1)improved 72 basis points to 55.2% and our  \nadjusted efficiency ratio (2)(3)improved to   \n54.4%.                                        \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  64    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nWe strengthened our risk and control          \nenvironment and continued to enhance our      \ncybersecurity capabilities. After sustained   \ninvestment and focus across the Company, we   \nwere pleased that the FRB formally closed     \nCapital One\u2019s cyber-related consent order. In \n2023, we implemented a dual-Chief Risk Officer\nstructure that is designed to enable us to    \neffectively manage the natural division       \nbetween the two broad and critical domains of \ncredit and financial risk management and      \nenterprise and operational risk management. In\n2023, Capital One launched new products,      \nsigned new partners, and developed innovative \ndigital tools and capabilities to enhance the \ncustomer experience while reducing the risk of\nfraud. We also earned a number of external    \nawards and accolades related to our products  \nand customer experiences, including, for the  \nfourth consecutive year, J.D. Power\u2019s #1 in   \nNational Bank for Overall Customer            \nSatisfaction, as published in the J.D.

The      \nperformance shares provide an opportunity for \nthe executive to receive from 0% to 150% of a \ntarget number of shares of the Company\u2019s      \ncommon stock based on the Company\u2019s           \nperformance over a three-year period beginning\nJanuary 1, 2024.                              \n                                              \n  \u2026        Ca\u2026        Ca\u2026    L\u2026           T\u2026  \n           Sa\u2026        In\u2026    I\u2026               \n       S\u2026         P\u2026                          \n       S\u2026         S\u2026                          \n       R\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        $9\u2026        $1\u2026    $\u2026    $1\u2026    $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        $1\u2026        $2\u2026    $\u2026    $2\u2026    $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        $1\u2026        $2\u2026    $\u2026    $1\u2026    $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        $1\u2026        $2\u2026    $\u2026    $1\u2026    $\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \nConsideration of Stockholder Feedback and 2023\nSay on Pay Vote The Committee and the Board   \nvalue the input of our stockholders and strive\nto foster a constructive dialogue with        \nstockholders on matters of executive          \ncompensation and corporate governance. At our \n2023 Annual Stockholder Meeting, 93% of our   \nstockholders supported our executive          \ncompensation program by approving our non-    \nbindingadvisory vote on executive compensation\n(\u201c2023 Say on Pay Vote\u201d). In addition, 91.2%  \nof our stockholders supported future votes on \nnamed executive officer compensation at a     \nfrequency of one year. Though the Committee   \nrecognized the 2023 Say on Pay Vote reflected \nstrong support for the Company\u2019s executive    \ncompensation programs, the Committee remains  \ncommitted to stockholder engagement. In 2023, \nwe continued to strengthen our outreach to    \nstockholders to maintain strong lines of      \ncommunication with our stockholders and shared\nstockholders\u2019 perspectives with the Committee \nand the Board. Management and our Investor    \nRelations team engaged in direct outreach and \ndiscussions with stockholders in a variety of \nforums. In 2023, our teams attended 14        \ninvestor conferences and hosted over 250      \ninvestor engagements. See \u201cStockholder        \nEngagement Program\u201d beginning on page 36 for  \nmore information. From this outreach, the     \nCommittee and the Board gained valuable       \ninsight into our investors\u2019 views about the   \nCompany, including our executive compensation \nprograms. The Committee and the Independent   \nDirectors considered these views and feedback \nin approving year-endincentive awards for 2023\nand structuring and approving the 2024        \ncompensation programs for the NEOs. In recent \nyears, as a result of the feedback received   \nfrom investors, the Committee made the        \nfollowing enhancements to our executive       \ncompensation programs and disclosure:         \n                                              \n       Linked a Portion of CEO Compensation   \n       Directly to Relative TSR.              \n       Stockholders have expressed that TSR   \n       is an important element of Company     \n       performance and asked that the         \n       Company consider a more direct link    \n       between CEO compensation and the       \n       Company\u2019s TSR over time. Beginning     \n  \u220e    with the 2020 performance year, the    \n       Committee and the Independent          \n       Directors determined to award a        \n       portion of the CEO\u2019s year-end          \n       incentive in the form of a             \n       performance share award that vests     \n       entirely based on the Company\u2019s TSR    \n       over a three-year performance period   \n       relative to the Performance Share      \n       Peers.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Disclosure of Performance Share        \n       Awards Realized Compensation.          \n       Stockholders have expressed a desire   \n       for clearer information regarding the  \n       realized pay associated with the       \n       performance share awards granted to    \n       the NEOs. We added disclosure          \n  \u220e    regarding the settlement value         \n       resulting from the performance share   \n       awards that vested during the          \n       performance year based on the          \n       Company\u2019s performance for the          \n       associated three-year performance      \n       period.

                                 \n                                              \nCompensation Program Objectives Capital One\u2019s \nexecutive compensation program has four       \nprimary objectives. Strongly link pay and     \nperformance by providing compensation based on\nboth business and individual performance while\nappropriately balancing risk Capital One      \nemphasizes pay-for-performanceat all          \norganizational levels. Typically, as an       \nexecutive\u2019s level of responsibility increases,\nso does the proportion of the executive\u2019s pay \nthat is subject to performance criteria.      \nTherefore, the NEOs have the highest          \nproportion of their pay directly linked to    \nCompany and individual performance, as        \ncompared to other associates. Awards made to  \nthe NEOs in February 2024 for the 2023        \nperformance year were based on Company and    \nindividual performance, and on demonstrating  \nspecific leadership competencies assessed     \nthrough a comprehensive performance management\nprocess that included an individual assessment\nspecifically designed to evaluate the degree  \nto which the executive balanced risks inherent\nto their role. The Chief Enterprise Risk      \nOfficer compiled these risk assessments and   \nthe Chief Human Resources Officer reviewed the\nassessments for the NEOs. Separately, the     \nChief Audit Officer compiled and reviewed the \nrisk assessment for the Chief Enterprise Risk \nOfficer. The Committee considered the         \nassessments in making its determinations      \nregarding individual performance and          \ncompensation levels. Align our executives\u2019    \ninterests with those of our stockholders The  \nCommittee and the Independent Directors are   \ncommitted to designing incentive compensation \nprograms that reward individual and Company   \nperformance and that are aligned with the     \ncreation of stockholder value over the long   \nterm. A portion of the CEO\u2019s performance share\naward is directly linked to the Company\u2019s     \nrelative TSR over a three-year period. TSR    \nalso continues to be explicitly included in   \nthe financial and operating performance       \nfactors considered by the Committee and the   \nIndependent Directors to determine NEO year-  \nendincentive awards. In addition, because     \nnearly half of NEO compensation is delivered  \nthrough deferred, equity-based vehicles that  \nvest over multiple time horizons, the NEOs    \nhave a significant stake in the success of the\nCompany. The Committee and the Independent    \nDirectors also have the flexibility to adjust \ncompensation decisions from year to year to   \ntake into account the Company\u2019s performance   \nand evolving market practices. In addition, we\nhave established specific stock ownership     \npolicies that the NEOs must meet and stock    \nretention provisions applicable to certain    \nequity awards. Reward performance over        \nmultiple time horizons Our compensation       \nprograms are structured to encourage our      \nexecutives to deliver strong results over the \nshort- term while making decisions that create\nsustained value for our stockholders over the \nlong-term. For 2023, approximately 83% of the \nCEO\u2019s total compensation was equity-based and \nat-riskto the performance of the Company\u2019s    \nstock price, and 100% of his year-endincentive\ncompensation was deferred for a three-year    \nperiod. In addition, approximately 49% of     \ntotal compensation for NEOs other than the CEO\nwas provided through equity-based vehicles    \nwhich were at-riskto the performance of the   \nCompany\u2019s stock price and subject to vesting  \nover multiple time horizons. The use of       \ndeferred, equity-based compensation vehicles  \nwith multi-year vesting terms advances our    \ngoal of aligning the ultimate value realized  \nby the NEOs with the performance of the       \nCompany\u2019s stock over time because the value of\nthese compensation vehicles increases and     \ndecreases based on the performance of the     \nCompany\u2019s stock price in both current and     \nfuture periods. Attract, retain, and motivate \ntop executive talent To attract, retain, and  \nmotivate exceptional leaders, we believe that \ncompensation opportunities at Capital One must\nbe competitive with the marketplace for       \ntalent. The Committee and the Independent     \nDirectors strive to preserve a competitive pay\nmix and total target compensation values in   \nthe executive compensation program, as well as\nprovide competitive total rewards based on our\nselected peer group. See \u201cPeer Groups\u201d        \nbeginning on page 99 for information regarding\nhow the Committee and the Independent         \nDirectors utilized the Company\u2019s peer group in\ndetermining executive compensation. Use of    \nJudgment The Committee believes that          \nexercising judgment is an important element in\nreaching balanced compensation decisions that \nare consistent with our strategy, risk        \nmanagement, and reward both current-year      \nperformance and                               \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            73  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nsustained long-term value creation, and       \nsupplements other aspects of Capital One\u2019s    \npay-for-performancephilosophy. By applying    \ninformed judgment, the Committee seeks to     \nmitigate the risks associated with a rigid and\nstrictly formulaic compensation program, which\ncould unintentionally create incentives for   \nour executives to focus only on certain       \nperformance metrics, encourage imprudent risk-\ntaking, and not provide the best long-term    \nresults for stockholders. In addition, the use\nof judgment allows the Committee to respond to\nchanges in economic conditions, our operating \nenvironment, and other significant factors    \nthat may affect the long-term performance of  \nCapital One or our lines of business. The use \nof judgment also allows the Committee to      \nadjust compensation based on factors that     \nwould not be appropriately reflected by a     \nstrictly formulaic approach, such as risk     \nmanagement, championing Company values, and   \nthe discrepancies between absolute and        \nrelative performance levels or recognition of \nindividual performance levels. Our            \nCompensation Governance Cycle The Committee is\nactively engaged throughout the year, and     \nmembers of the Committee regularly meet with  \nmanagement, regarding the Company\u2019s executive \ncompensation programs and practices. In       \naddition, the Committee and the Board receive \nregular updates regarding the Company\u2019s       \nfinancial and strategic performance, including\ninformation regarding the Company\u2019s           \nperformance against the four categories of    \nquantitative and qualitative performance      \nfactors related to: financial and operating   \nperformance, governance and risk management,  \nstrategic performance, and winning with our   \ncustomers and associates (the \u201cPerformance    \nFactors\u201d) that are used by the Committee to   \ndetermine the year-endincentive awards to the \nNEOs. The Committee met four times in 2023    \nwith one meeting concluding with an executive \nsession without management present. In        \naddition, the Committee held two joint        \nmeetings with the Board in 2023, and an       \nadditional joint meeting was held at the      \nbeginning of 2024 to assess Company and NEO   \nperformance and determine the year-           \nendincentive awards for the NEOs.

The Committee considers\nthe Company\u2019s and the CEO\u2019s historical        \nperformance and seeks to effectively align the\nCEO\u2019s interests with the interests of our     \nstockholders over time, support safety and    \nsoundness, and appropriately balance risk.    \n2023 CEO Compensation Program When determining\nthe structure of Mr. Fairbank\u2019s compensation  \nprogram for the 2023 performance year, the    \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nconsidered:                                   \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s performance during the   \n  \u220e    prior year and Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u2019s          \n       contribution to that performance;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s performance in the       \n  \u220e    prior year relative to the             \n       performance of peer comparator         \n       companies in that year;                \n                                              \n                                              \n       the structure and amount of            \n  \u220e    compensation awarded to the CEOs of    \n       the Company\u2019s peers;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       the structure and amount of Mr.\u00a0       \n  \u220e    Fairbank\u2019s compensation awards in      \n       prior years;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s risk profile and the     \n  \u220e    time horizon over which the deferred,  \n       equity-based awards will vest;         \n                                              \n                                              \n       the ultimate value of Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u2019s   \n       deferred, equity-based awards (which   \n       will depend on the Company\u2019s and Mr.\u00a0  \n  \u220e    Fairbank\u2019s performance over time as    \n       well as the value of Capital One       \n       common stock at the time the awards    \n       vest); and                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       the feedback received from             \n       stockholders regarding the Company\u2019s   \n  \u220e    executive compensation programs and    \n       the compensation awarded to Mr.        \n       Fairbank.                              \n                                              \nAfter considering these factors, in January   \n2023, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors determined that Mr. Fairbank\u2019s 2023 \ncompensation program would continue to consist\nof two components: (i) an equity or equity-   \nbased award granted at the beginning of the   \nperformance year; and (ii) an opportunity for \na year-endincentive award, with the amount    \ngranted based on CEO and Company performance  \nin 2023 (granted in February 2024). Any year- \nendincentive award granted to the CEO (i)     \nwould continue to consist primarily of a      \nperformance share award, under which he may   \nreceive 0% to 150% of a target number of      \nshares of Capital One common stock based on   \nthe Company\u2019s performance over a three-year   \nperiod; and (ii) may also consist of deferred \ncash, an equity-based award, or both. In this \nmanner, the CEO\u2019s compensation will continue  \nto be completely at-riskbased on the Company\u2019s\nand Mr. Fairbank\u2019s performance, and all CEO   \ncompensation continues to be subject to a     \nthree-year deferred vesting or payout. As in  \nprior years, Mr. Fairbank did not receive any \ncash salary in 2023. The Committee and the    \nIndependent Directors determined not to       \nestablish a total target compensation amount  \nfor Mr. Fairbank\u2019s 2023 compensation program  \nto further align Mr. Fairbank\u2019s compensation  \nprogram with that of the Company\u2019s peers and  \nincrease the Committee and the Independent    \nDirectors\u2019 ability to directly link the CEO\u2019s \ncompensation to the Company\u2019s performance as  \nwell as the CEO\u2019s contributions to that       \nperformance over the short-, medium-, and     \nlong-term.                                    \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            75  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n2023 CEO Compensation Components The chart    \nbelow represents the components and pay mix of\nthe CEO\u2019s compensation for the 2023           \nperformance year.

For        \npurposes of the year-endincentive, the        \nCommittee and the Independent Directors assess\nthe Company\u2019s performance based on the        \nPerformance Factors. The Committee believes   \nthat these factors appropriately reflect and  \nbalance near-term performance and long-term   \nsuccess for the Company\u2019s customers,          \nassociates, and stockholders. The Company\u2019s   \n2023 performance against the Performance      \nFactors is described in more detail under     \n\u201c2023 Year-EndIncentive Determination\u201d        \nbeginning on page 81. The year-endincentive,  \nif awarded, (i) will consist of an award of   \nperformance shares, and (ii) may also consist \nof deferred cash, an equity-based award, or   \nboth as determined by the Committee and the   \nIndependent Directors at the time the award is\ngranted. The performance share awards, the    \nequity-based award, and the deferred cash     \nbonus each have a three-year cliff-vesting    \nschedule and vest in full at the end of a     \nthree-year performance period beginning on    \nJanuary 1, 2024. The equity-based awards are  \nsubject to performance-based vesting          \nprovisions and all three awards are subject to\nclawback provisions each as described in more \ndetail under \u201cAdditional Performance          \nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning \non page 95. Performance Share Awards The      \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve the performance shares strengthen the \nalignment between the compensation of our NEOs\nand the Company\u2019s performance by linking the  \nultimate payout to pre-establishedabsolute    \nand/or relative performance goals, with the   \nvalue of the payout ranging from 0% to 150%.  \nThe ultimate value of the performance shares  \nupon vesting is determined by the Company\u2019s   \nperformance through its stock price. The CEO  \nyear-endincentive award consists primarily of \nperformance shares. For the other NEOs, the   \nperformance share awards represent            \napproximately 30% of total target             \ncompensation. For 2023, the performance share \nawards were granted in two forms:             \n                                              \n       Financial Performance Share Units      \n       (\u201cFinancial Performance Shares\u201d) that  \n       vest based on the Company\u2019s financial  \n       performance, on an absolute basis and  \n       relative to the Performance Share      \n       Peers, related to a combination of     \n       two metrics: D+TBV and Adjusted ROTCE  \n       over a three-year period.

TSR is   \nviewed by investors as a key indicator of the \nCompany\u2019s performance. The TSR Performance    \nShares create a direct link between CEO       \ncompensation and the Company\u2019s stock price and\nvalue creation over time. In addition, a      \nsignificant portion of CEO pay is delivered   \nthrough equity-based awards, the ultimate     \nvalue of which will increase or decrease based\non the performance of the Company\u2019s stock     \nprice in both current and future periods.     \nPerformance Share Award Peer Group. For both  \nthe Financial Performance Shares and the TSR  \nPerformance Shares, the Company\u2019s performance \non each metric is assessed over the three-year\nperiod relative to the \u201cPerformance Share     \nPeers\u201d which consist of the KBW Bank Index,   \nexcluding non-traditionalbanks that do not    \nfocus on lending to consumers and businesses  \n(\u201cKBW Index\u201d). The Committee believes that the\nKBW Index is an appropriate index against     \nwhich to assess the Company\u2019s performance     \nbecause it reflects institutions of a         \ncomparable size, risk profile, and business   \nmix to the Company. After the end of the      \nthree-year performance period, the Committee  \nwill certify the Company\u2019s performance and    \nissue the corresponding number of shares of   \nthe Company\u2019s common stock, if any, in        \naccordance with the relative performance      \nhurdles illustrated below. Performance Share  \nAward Formula. For all performance share      \nawards, the ultimate number of performance    \nshares earned at vesting is determined by a   \nformula based on relative performance and/or  \nabsolute performance (in the form of a        \nperformance share reduction) measures, with   \nthe value of the payout ranging from 0% to    \n150% of the target performance shares. In     \naddition, the value of the performance shares \nupon vesting is determined by the Company\u2019s   \nstock price performance. All performance share\nawards are subject to the Relative Performance\nMeasure (as described below). Only the        \nFinancial Performance Shares are subject to   \nthe Absolute Performance Measure (as described\nbelow). The award agreements applicable to all\nperformance share awards permit the Committee \nto exclude the initial effects of changes in  \ntax laws, accounting principles or            \nregulations, or other laws or provisions      \naffecting the reported results if the         \nCommittee determines that such adjustments are\nappropriate in order to prevent dilution or   \nenlargement of the benefits or potential      \nbenefits intended to be made available under  \nthe 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or necessary or \nappropriate to comply with applicable laws,   \nrules, or regulations.                        \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            79  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nRelative Performance Measure - Financial      \nPerformance Shares and TSR Performance Shares.\nEach year, the Committee and the Independent  \nDirectors assess the Company\u2019s performance on \nthe basis of the performance share award      \nmetrics relative to the Performance Share     \nPeers. The Company\u2019s TSR or positive Adjusted \nROTCE and D+TBV, as applicable, must be at    \nleast at the 25th percentile of the           \nPerformance Share Peers for any performance   \nshares to vest; target payout will be achieved\nat the 55th percentile of the Performance     \nShare Peers; and the maximum payout can only  \nbe achieved if the Company performs at the    \n80th percentile of the Performance Share Peers\nor greater. If the Company\u2019s TSR or Adjusted  \nROTCE and D+TBV, as applicable, is under the  \n25th percentile, none of the shares will vest \nand no payout will be made with respect to the\naward. After the end of the three-year        \nperformance period, the Committee will certify\nthe Company\u2019s performance and issue the       \ncorresponding number of shares of the         \nCompany\u2019s common stock, if any, in accordance \nwith the graph below.

The Financial Performance Shares are  \nsubject to a performance share reduction      \nfeature under which the number of shares      \nissued at settlement will be reduced if the   \nCompany\u2019s Adjusted ROTCE for one or more      \nfiscal years completed during the performance \nperiod is not positive, no matter how well the\nCompany performs compared to the Performance  \nShare Peers. In each year that the Company    \ndoes not achieve positive Adjusted ROTCE, the \nexecutive will forfeit 50% of that year\u2019s     \nworth of performance shares. If the Company\u2019s \nAdjusted ROTCE is not positive in each of the \nthree fiscal years in the performance period, \nthe executive will forfeit the entire award of\nperformance shares.

For the 2021, 2022, and 2023 performance\nyears, the Committee and the Independent      \nDirectors have awarded RSUs to Mr. Fairbank.  \nThe vesting of the RSUs is deferred for three \nyears and settlement is in cash based on the  \nCompany\u2019s average stock price over the 15     \ntrading days preceding the vesting date. The  \nRSUs are subject to performance-based vesting \nand clawback provisions, each as described in \nmore detail under \u201cAdditional Performance     \nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning \non page 95. Deferred Cash Bonus A portion of  \nthe CEO year-endincentive may be granted in   \nthe form of a deferred cash bonus based on the\nCompany and CEO performance for the preceding \nperformance year. Any deferred cash bonus     \naward is mandatorily deferred for three years \ninto the Company\u2019s VNQDCP. 2023 CEO           \nCompensation Decisions For the 2023           \nperformance year, the Committee and the       \nIndependent Directors determined the amount   \nand form of the CEO\u2019s compensation using a    \nbalanced approach in the context of our       \ncompensation principles and objectives, which \nencompass a pay-for-performancephilosophy. The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve that this structure emphasizes        \nvariable pay and incentivizes the CEO to      \ninvest for the long-term, grow resiliently,   \nmanage risk, and deliver sustained stockholder\nvalue. This approach provides the Committee   \nand the Independent Directors the best        \nopportunity to determine the amount and form  \nof compensation based on CEO and Company      \nperformance as well as stockholder feedback.  \nIt also allows for responsiveness to current  \nbusiness and industry conditions and the      \ndynamic nature of executive compensation best \npractices. 2023 RSU Award In January 2023, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nawarded Mr. Fairbank 21,539 RSUs, which had a \ntotal grant date value of approximately $2.5  \nmillion.

Under Mr.     \nFairbank\u2019s leadership, the Company delivered  \nvery strong financial and operating results,  \nresilient account and loan growth, and strong \nstewardship of stockholder capital. The       \nCompany deftly navigated a challenging period \nof elevated stress on bank funding and        \nliquidity as well as significant scrutiny of  \nthe banking industry. As revenue growth       \nslowed, the Company proactively managed       \noperating expenses and delivered improved     \nyear-over-year operating efficiency. Capital  \nOne\u2019s careful and successful management of the\nCompany\u2019s post-pandemic loan originations,    \nwhich sought to account for credit score      \ninflation and elevated industry supply, led to\npositive separation between Capital One\u2019s and \ncompetitors\u2019 consumer credit metrics over the \ncourse of 2023. The Company returned          \nsignificant capital to stockholders through   \ncommon dividends and share repurchases while  \ncontinuing to invest in growth, technology and\ndata capabilities and marketing. Solid        \nfinancial results and strong momentum on long-\nterm strategy resulted in the Company\u2019s share \nprice rising 41%, 46 percentage points above  \nthe KBW Bank Index. Capital One shares also   \nsignificantly outperformed the S&P 500 index  \nby 17 percentage points. The Company\u2019s one-   \nyear TSR, which combines stock returns with   \nthe distribution of common dividends,         \nsignificantly outperformed the peer comparator\ngroup, the KBW Bank Index, and the S&P 500.   \nCapital One maintained strong market          \npositions, drove resilient growth and returns \nacross the Company\u2019s lines of business, and   \nmaintained high customer advocacy scores. Our \nCard business delivered strong loan growth and\nrecord purchase volume as it capitalized on   \nthe benefits of new products, compelling      \nrewards, strong brand advocacy and a          \ntechnology-driven customer and digital        \nexperience. Our Consumer Banking business     \nachieved solid earnings, strong deposit       \ngrowth, and resilient auto loan originations. \nOur Commercial Banking business also delivered\nsolid returns despite navigating challenging  \nindustry headwinds. Capital One continued to  \ninvest in talent and our modern technology and\ndata environment while realizing the many     \nbenefits of our migration to the cloud. We are\nembracing the potential of artificial         \nintelligence and machine learning and finding \nopportunities to leverage innovative tools to \nreimagine the customer experience. Capital One\nrecruited skilled, experienced and diverse    \ntalent and maintained high associate          \nengagement and morale scores as measured in   \nour regular enterprise-wide surveys. The      \nCompany was recognized externally for being an\nexceptional place to launch or grow one\u2019s     \ncareer. Mr. Fairbank maintained a keen focus  \non building and sustaining strong risk        \nmanagement practices and controls and         \nembedding resilience into our operations and  \nfinancial choices, and, in 2023, the FRB      \nlifted its 2020 cyber-related consent order.  \nIn addition, Mr. Fairbank continued to model  \nand reinforce the Company\u2019s culture, values   \nand mission with associates, recruits,        \npartners, suppliers, and investors. The       \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve that the Company\u2019s tactical and       \nstrategic choices in recent years, led by Mr. \nFairbank, have resulted in strong stockholder \nreturns and will continue to contribute to    \nincreasing stockholder value over time. The   \nCommittee and the Independent Directors also  \ntook into account Mr. Fairbank\u2019s unique role  \nas the founder of Capital One, as well as peer\ngroup CEO compensation levels and structure,  \nthe tenures of peer companies\u2019 CEOs, and the  \nvarying degrees of success those CEOs have had\nin leading their respective companies in 2023 \nand over time. The Committee and the          \nIndependent Directors recognized that Mr.     \nFairbank does not receive a cash salary, and  \n100% of his compensation is deferred for at   \nleast three years. The Committee and the      \nIndependent Directors believe that the actions\ntaken by Mr. Fairbank and the other NEOs      \nthroughout 2023 drove very strong financial   \nand operating results and continued the       \nmomentum of the Company toward the achievement\nof its long-term strategic objectives. These  \nactions and choices have positioned the       \nCompany to deliver strong and sustainable     \nfinancial performance, maintain resilience,   \nand create enduring value to stockholders.    \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  86    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nCEO Compensation by Performance Year Below is \na table showing Mr. Fairbank\u2019s compensation   \nawards as they are attributable to the        \nperformance years indicated.

In February 2024, the   \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nreviewed the 2023 compensation structure      \nutilized for Mr. Fairbank and determined that,\nfor 2024, the CEO compensation program would  \nbe unchanged and continue to consist of two   \ncomponents:                                   \n                                              \n       An Equity or Equity-Based Award.

Any       \n       year-end incentive award granted to    \n       the CEO (i)\u00a0will continue to consist   \n       primarily of performance share         \n       awards, including an award of TSR      \n       Performance Shares and Financial       \n       Performance Shares, under which he     \n       may receive 0% to 150% of a target     \n       number of shares of Capital One        \n       common stock based on the Company\u2019s    \n       financial performance and TSR over a   \n       three-year period; and (ii)\u00a0may also   \n       consist of deferred cash, an           \n  \u220e    equity-based award, or both.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nIn this manner, the CEO\u2019s compensation will   \ncontinue to be completely at-riskbased on the \nCompany\u2019s and Mr. Fairbank\u2019s performance, and \nall CEO compensation continues to be subject  \nto a three-year deferred vesting or payout. As\nin prior years, Mr. Fairbank will not receive \nany cash salary in 2024. Any deferred cash or \nequity-based award will pay out or vest after \na three-year deferral period. The Committee   \nand the Independent Directors will use their  \njudgment to determine whether to make the     \nyear-endincentive award, the form of the award\nand the value of the award. The Committee and \nthe Independent Directors will base these     \ndeterminations on the Committee\u2019s evaluation  \nof the Company\u2019s performance in 2024 relative \nto the same factors described earlier under   \n\u201cYear-EndIncentive Opportunity\u201d beginning on  \npage 77, related to financial and operating   \nperformance, governance and risk management,  \nstrategic performance and winning with our    \ncustomers and associates, and Mr. Fairbank\u2019s  \ncontribution to that performance.             \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            89  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nNEO Compensation In this section, \u201cNEO        \nCompensation,\u201d the term \u201cNEO\u201d refers to the   \nNEOs other than the CEO. 2023 NEO Compensation\nProgram and Components The Committee annually \nreviews and approves the form, timing, and    \namount of compensation for all of our         \nexecutive officers, including those who are   \nultimately reported as NEOs, and makes        \nrecommendations to the Independent Directors  \nfor final approval. The Committee takes into  \naccount each NEO\u2019s historical performance,    \nindividual roles and responsibilities,        \ncontributions expected from each NEO in the   \nfuture as well as the recommendations of the  \nCEO, including his assessment of each NEO\u2019s   \nperformance. In January 2023, the Committee   \nand the Independent Directors approved the    \n2023 compensation program, which is designed  \nto be consistent with the Company\u2019s pay-for-  \nperformancephilosophy. Based on market        \npractices and trends, a review of peer        \ncomparator information and in response to     \nstockholder feedback, NEO total target        \ncompensation is composed of 20% base salary,  \n25% cash incentive opportunity, and 55% long- \nterm incentive opportunity, which will consist\nof performance shares and stock-settled RSUs  \nas determined by the Committee. The Committee \nbelieves that this pay mix balances           \nstockholder interests while effectively       \nrewarding and motivating key talent. For the  \n2023 performance year, the NEOs received a mix\nof approximately 51% cash and 49% equity-based\ncompensation as follows: cash salary,         \ndetermined at the beginning of the performance\nyear; and a cash incentive and long-term      \nincentive awards, determined following the end\nof the performance year based on the          \nCommittee\u2019s evaluation of Company and         \nindividual performance during the past year.  \nThe long-term incentive awards granted for the\n2023 performance year consisted of performance\nshares (approximately 27% of total awarded    \ncompensation) and stock-settled RSUs          \n(approximately 22% of total awarded           \ncompensation). All of the equity awards vest  \nover a three-year period. The terms of the    \nperformance share awards are substantially    \nsimilar to the terms of the Financial         \nPerformance Share awards granted to our CEO in\n2023, as described earlier under \u201cPerformance \nShare Awards\u201d beginning on page 77. The table \nbelow summarizes the NEO compensation program \nthat the Committee and the Independent        \nDirectors approved for the 2023 performance   \nyear. The total target compensation of the    \nNEOs for the 2023 performance year was        \ncomposed of base salary awarded at the        \nbeginning of the performance year and a year- \nendincentive opportunity that, if granted, may\nconsist of equity awards in the form of       \nperformance shares and/or RSUs, and a cash    \nincentive.

Individual details for each NEO   \nare provided in the table below showing       \ncompensation by performance year. Year-       \nEndIncentive Awards A portion of the NEOs\u2019    \n2023 compensation consisted of an opportunity \nfor a year-endincentive award based on Company\nand the NEO\u2019s individual performance in 2023. \nThis award, if granted, may consist of long-  \nterm incentive awards in the form of          \nperformance shares and/or RSUs, and a cash    \nincentive award. In February 2024, the        \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \ndetermined to award each NEO performance      \nshares, a cash incentive award, and RSUs as   \nrecognition of Company and NEO individual     \nperformance in 2023. The year-endincentive    \nawards are subject to performance-based       \nvesting and clawback provisions as discussed  \nbelow under \u201cAdditional Performance Conditions\nand Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning on page 95.\nCash Incentive Awards The cash incentive      \nawards provided to the NEOs are based on the  \nCommittee\u2019s evaluation of the Company\u2019s       \nperformance during 2023. In January 2023, the \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nestablished a target value for the cash       \nincentive for each NEO consisting of          \napproximately 25% of the NEOs\u2019 total target   \ncompensation. The Committee and the           \nIndependent Directors may determine to award  \n0% to 150% of the cash incentive target value \nbased on Company performance. For purposes of \nthe cash incentive awards, the Committee and  \nthe Independent Directors assess the Company\u2019s\nperformance based on the Performance Factors. \nThe Committee believes that these factors     \nappropriately reflect and balance near-term   \nperformance and long-term success for the     \nCompany\u2019s customers, associates, and          \nstockholders. See \u201cCompany Performance        \nAssessment\u201d beginning on page 83 for details  \nregarding the Performance Factors. In February\n2024, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors approved cash incentive awards for  \nthe NEOs ranging from approximately $1.9      \nmillion to $2.5 million, representing a payout\nat 150% of the target award values established\nby the Committee in January 2023, based on    \nactual Company performance in 2023. Individual\ndetails for each NEO are provided in the table\nbelow showing compensation by performance     \nyear. The assessment of Company performance   \nfor the NEOs is consistent with the assessment\nperformed in connection with the CEO year-    \nendincentive award. The Committee and the     \nIndependent Directors determined that these   \nawards were appropriate in light of the       \nCompany\u2019s performance as described under \u201c2023\nYear-EndIncentive Determination\u201d beginning on \npage 81 in connection with the determinations \nby the Committee and the Independent Directors\nrelating to the CEO\u2019s year-endincentive       \nawards. Long-Term Incentive Awards Long-term  \nincentive awards are designed to reward       \nindividual performance and align a significant\nportion of compensation with achievement of   \nboth annual and long-term performance goals.  \nIn determining the actual amounts to be       \nawarded to each NEO, the Committee considered \neach NEO\u2019s contribution to the Company\u2019s      \nperformance for 2023, as well as the          \nindividual performance of each NEO. The       \nCommittee also received input from the CEO on \nhis assessment of each NEO\u2019s individual       \nperformance and his recommendations for       \ncompensation of the NEOs. The CEO also        \nassessed the degree to which the NEO balanced \nrisks inherent in the NEO\u2019s role. These       \nassessments included the use of both          \nquantitative and qualitative risk measures and\nwere compiled by the Chief Enterprise Risk    \nOfficer and reviewed by the Chief Human       \nResources Officer, and separately the Chief   \nAudit Officer compiled and reviewed the       \nassessment for the Chief Enterprise Risk      \nOfficer and the Chief Credit and Financial    \nRisk Officer, before such assessments were    \npresented to the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors for their consideration.            \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  92    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nIn February 2024, the Committee and the       \nIndependent Directors granted long-term       \nincentive awards, consisting of stock-settled \nRSUs and performance shares, to the NEOs, as  \nrecognition for individual NEO performance in \n2023 and to drive further long-term           \nperformance.

Additional details on these     \nprograms can be found in the \u201cNamed Executive \nOfficer Compensation\u201d section beginning on    \npage 104. 2024 NEO Compensation Program Each  \nyear, the Committee reviews the NEO           \ncompensation program in light of Company      \nperformance data, peer comparator group       \nperformance data, historical pay information, \ndata on specific market practices and trends, \nstockholder feedback, and other relevant      \npoints of information. The program consists of\nmultiple compensation vehicles that directly  \nlink the NEOs\u2019 compensation with the Company\u2019s\nperformance over multiple time horizons, align\nthe NEOs\u2019 interests with the interests of the \nCompany\u2019s stockholders, support safety and    \nsoundness, and encourage appropriate risk-    \ntaking. In February 2024, the Committee and   \nthe Independent Directors approved the 2024   \ncompensation program for our NEOs, which is   \nsubstantially similar to the 2023 program.    \nAdditional Performance Conditions and Recovery\nProvisions The awards granted to our NEOs     \ninclude the following provisions that are     \ndesigned to further enhance alignment between \npay and performance and balance the risks that\nour incentive compensation programs might     \notherwise encourage:                          \n                                             \n  \u220e    Performance-based vesting provisions  \n                                             \n                                    \n  \u220e    Performance share reduction  \n                                    \n                            \n  \u220e    Misconduct clawback  \n                            \n                                       \n  \u220e    Financial restatement clawback  \n                                       \nThese terms and conditions apply to certain   \nincentive awards granted to every executive   \nofficer and not just to the NEOs.             \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            95  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nPerformance-Based Vesting Provisions          \n                                              \n                         We include           \n                         performance-based    \n                         vesting provisions   \n                         in each award of     \n                         stock options, if    \n                         any, and             \n                         stock-settled RSUs   \n                         granted to NEOs and  \n                         each award of        \n                         cash-settled RSUs    \n                         granted to the CEO.  \n                         These provisions     \n                         will reduce the      \n                         total value          \n  Performance- Based\u00a0    delivered to the     \n  Vesting Provisions     executive at         \n                         vesting if the       \n                         Company does not     \n                         meet certain         \n                         performance          \n                         thresholds during    \n                         the three-year       \n                         vesting period. The  \n                         total value can be   \n                         reduced to zero if   \n                         the performance      \n                         threshold is not     \n                         met in any of the    \n                         three years in the   \n                         performance period.  \n                                              \nThe ultimate value that our NEOs receive from \nequity-based incentive awards is tied to our  \nstock price performance over the vesting      \nperiod. In addition, the Committee            \nnevertheless determined that these awards     \nshould be subject to additional performance   \nconditions so that the value received by the  \nexecutives is also conditioned upon the       \nCompany continuing to meet certain operating  \nperformance thresholds for each and every     \nfiscal year ending in the three-year vesting  \nperiod. Any forfeitures will be cumulative    \nover the three-year vesting period. In this   \nmanner, regardless of our executives\u2019 past    \nperformance and our stock price performance,  \nthe awards subject to performance-based       \nvesting remain at risk of complete forfeiture \nover the three-year vesting period.           \nPerformance-based vesting provisions apply to \nthe following awards:                         \n                                   \n  \u220e    All NEO stock-settled RSUs  \n                                   \n                                  \n  \u220e    All CEO cash-settled RSUs  \n                                  \nThese performance conditions do not present   \nany upside potential for the NEOs\u2019            \ncompensation but instead create an additional \nat-riskelement to the compensation that has   \nbeen awarded to them. Imposing these          \nadditional performance conditions is designed \nto further reflect our approach of balancing  \nrisk and performance over the long term. For  \nawards granted since January 2014, vesting is \nconditioned on the Company achieving positive \nCore Earnings (as defined below). If Core     \nEarnings are not positive for any fiscal year \nin the vesting period, the named executive    \nofficer will automatically forfeit 50% of one \nyear\u2019s worth of vesting (i.e., one-sixthof the\ntotal award). In addition, the Committee will \ndetermine the extent to which any named       \nexecutive officer was accountable for the     \noutcome and, based on such determination, the \nCommittee will decide whether any or all of   \nthe remaining 50% of one year\u2019s worth of      \nvesting will also be forfeited. The Committee \nmay also decide to delay the vesting of the   \napplicable portion of the award not so        \nforfeited. For the NEOs, these determinations \nwill be made each year prior to the scheduled \nvesting date, based on the Core Earnings for  \nthe fiscal year ended prior to such vesting   \ndate. For the CEO, these determinations will  \nbe made prior to the scheduled vesting date at\nthe end of the three-year vesting period,     \ntaking into account Core Earnings for each    \nfiscal year within the period. Core Earnings  \nfocuses on whether profits are being generated\nby our basic business, as opposed to other    \nfactors that may not reflect business         \nfundamentals. The applicable award agreements \ndefine \u201cCore Earnings\u201d to mean the Company\u2019s  \nnet income available to common stockholders,  \nexcluding, on a tax-adjustedbasis, the impact \nof (i) impairment or amortization of goodwill \nand intangible assets, and (ii) the build or  \nrelease of the allowance for credit losses,   \ncalculated as the difference between the      \nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs,  \nnet of recoveries. The Committee believes that\nCore Earnings is an appropriate performance   \nmetric to employ for these performance-based  \nvesting provisions because the metric captures\nmajor operational costs and risks to the      \nCompany\u2019s business, including charge-offs,    \noperating expenses, market and competitive    \nrisks, and costs to maintain adequate levels  \nof capital and liquidity. The metric is based \non net income available to common stockholders\nand it also includes the impact of            \ndiscontinued operations.                      \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  96    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nPerformance Share Reduction                   \n                                              \n                         Each performance     \n                         share award granted  \n                         to the NEOs          \n                         provides that the    \n                         total value          \n                         delivered at         \n                         vesting will be      \n                         reduced if for any   \n                         year in the          \n                         three-year           \n                         performance period   \n                         the Company does     \n                         not achieve          \n  Performance Share\u00a0     positive Adjusted    \n  Reduction              ROTCE.

These reductions will \noccur regardless of how well the Company\u2019s    \nAdjusted ROTCE compares to the Performance    \nShare Peers. If the Company does not achieve  \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for one year in the   \nperformance period, the total number of shares\nissued on the vesting date will be reduced by \none-sixth.If the Company does not achieve     \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for two years in the  \nperformance period, the total number of shares\nissued on the vesting date will be reduced by \none-third.If the Company does not achieve     \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for any of the three  \nyears in the performance period, the NEOs will\nforfeit the entire award. In this manner, even\nif we outperform compared to the comparator   \ngroup, the performance share awards are at    \nrisk of complete forfeiture if we do not      \nachieve a threshold level of performance on an\nabsolute basis.

Process and    \nCriteria for Compensation Decisions The       \nCommittee considers a number of factors in    \nmaking compensation decisions with respect to \nthe NEOs. The Committee relies on a range of  \nobjective data including Company performance  \ndata, peer comparator group performance data, \nhistorical pay information, data on specific  \nmarket practices and trends, stockholder      \nfeedback, and other relevant points of        \ninformation to inform its business judgment.  \nUse of Outside Consultants for NEO            \nCompensation The Committee engages FW Cook, an\nindependent compensation consultant, to assist\nin the design of the CEO compensation program.\nFW Cook assists the Committee in a number of  \nways, including proposing and evaluating a    \npeer comparator group, gathering relevant     \ncompensation data from the peer group,        \ndiscussing relevant market trends and context \nand developing recommendations on possible    \nplan designs. The Chief Human Resources       \nOfficer and other members of the Company\u2019s    \nHuman Resources department assist the CEO in  \ndeveloping compensation recommendations for   \nthe NEOs other than the CEO for the           \nCommittee\u2019s consideration. The Human Resources\ndepartment typically uses multiple surveys as \nsources of market compensation data. FW Cook  \nalso provides additional market reference     \npoints that the Committee and the Independent \nDirectors use when evaluating NEO             \ncompensation, and other outside consultants   \nprovide information to the Human Resources    \ndepartment regarding market practices, trends,\nand research reports. The Human Resources     \ndepartment is responsible for analyzing the   \ninformation obtained from the outside         \nconsultants and presenting it to the CEO, who \nconsiders the information and makes his       \ncompensation recommendations for the other    \nNEOs to the Committee and the Independent     \nDirectors. A consultant from FW Cook is       \npresent at Committee meetings during which CEO\nand NEO compensation is discussed and provides\nmarket data as well as an independent         \nperspective regarding CEO and NEO compensation\npractices. FW Cook has no other engagement    \nwith, and performs no other services for,     \nCapital One other than the services described \nabove.

These  \norganizations are intended to represent the   \nmarketplace of companies with which Capital   \nOne competes for business and for executive   \ntalent. The compensation data from the peer   \ngroup is used to inform the Committee\u2019s       \ndetermination of the structure and the total  \ncompensation target values of the compensation\nprogram for the NEOs other than the CEO as    \nwell as the total level of compensation for   \nthe CEO. The peer comparator group is reviewed\neach year and adjusted, as appropriate, so    \nthat the peer comparator group companies      \nreflect Capital One\u2019s competitive environment.\nThe Committee examines pay practices and data \nfor the peer group companies as a source of   \nbenchmarking data to assess the               \ncompetitiveness of our compensation levels and\npay components. As part of this analysis, a   \nconsultant from FW Cook presents a            \ncomprehensive report to the Committee that    \nhighlights the size, scope, and performance   \ninformation from the peer companies across a  \nvariety of metrics and presents               \nrecommendations for changes to the peer group,\nas applicable.

The peer comparator group is        \nreviewed each year and adjusted, as           \nappropriate, so that the size, scope,         \nperformance, and business focus of the peer   \ncomparator companies (i) reflect Capital One\u2019s\ncompetitive environment, (ii) mitigate market \ndata volatility, (iii) recognize the Company\u2019s\nfocus on technological innovations in the     \nbanking industry, and (iv) position the       \nCompany near the median with regard to the    \nsize of the companies in the group.

As of December 31, 2023,    \nCapital One was positioned at or near the     \nmedian of the peer comparator group in terms  \nof total assets, loans, deposits, revenues,   \nmarket value and net income.                  \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            99  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nPeer Group to Determine Settlement of         \nPerformance Share Awards For both the         \nFinancial Performance Shares and the TSR      \nPerformance Shares, the Company\u2019s performance \non each metric is assessed over the three-year\nperiod relative to the Performance Share      \nPeers. See \u201cPerformance Share Award Peer      \nGroup\u201d on page 79 for a description and       \ndiscussion of the Performance Share Peers.    \nTally Sheets In addition to considering market\ndata from our peer comparator group (when     \navailable), the Committee also conducts an    \nannual comprehensive review of tally sheets   \nfor the CEO and each NEO which reflect all    \ncomponents of compensation and include total  \ncompensation and potential payouts. Each tally\nsheet summarizes multiple components of       \ncurrent and historical compensation. The tally\nsheets assist with the Committee\u2019s            \nunderstanding of the historical context that  \nis relevant to current compensation decisions,\nsuch as the CEO and each NEO\u2019s unrealized     \nequity value. Other Compensation Arrangements \nPension and Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation\nPlans Capital One does not have any active    \npension plans for the NEOs. In 2023, each of  \nour NEOs participated in Capital One\u2019s VNQDCP,\nwhich is a voluntary, non-qualifieddeferred   \ncompensation plan that restores participating \nNEOs, excluding the CEO, to the level of      \nsavings they would have achieved if they had  \nnot been impacted by Internal Revenue Service \nlimits governing our qualified 401(k) plan. It\nalso allows the NEOs, excluding the CEO, to   \ndefer additional pre-taxcompensation in order \nto save for retirement. The CEO participates  \nin the VNQDCP on a non-voluntarybasis, as the \ndeferred cash portion of his year-endincentive\nis mandatorily deferred in the VNQDCP for     \nthree years. Capital One periodically reviews \npension and other deferred compensation       \nprograms and practices at our peer comparator \ncompanies and across the financial services   \nindustry. We also review changes in the legal \nand regulatory environment pertaining to      \nretirement programs. Details of the VNQDCP can\nbe found under \u201cCapital One\u2019s Voluntary Non-  \nQualifiedDeferred Compensation Programs\u201d on   \npage 112. Employment Agreements Capital One   \ntypically does not enter into defined term    \nemployment agreements with the NEOs in order  \nto maintain maximum flexibility in            \nestablishing separation terms at the          \nappropriate time and considering their current\ncircumstances. The Committee retains full     \ndiscretion to approve employment agreements on\nan exception basis and has done so for        \nexceptional circumstances in the past. None of\nthe current NEOs have an employment agreement.\nChange of Control Agreements Each NEO         \ncurrently employed by the Company is a party  \nto an agreement providing certain benefits if \nthe executive\u2019s employment terminates in      \nconnection with a change of control, as well  \nas compensation and benefits protections      \nduring the two-yearperiod following the change\nof control. The change of control agreements  \ndefine compensation and benefits payable to   \nNEOs in certain merger and acquisition        \nscenarios. The Committee believes these       \nagreements provide the NEOs with some         \ncertainty and allow the NEOs to remain neutral\nand consider a full range of strategic        \ndecisions that are focused on maximizing      \nstockholder value. The change of control      \nagreements are also intended to allow Capital \nOne\u2019s businesses to operate with minimal      \ndisruption in the event of a change of control\nby providing each NEO with an incentive to    \nremain in their leadership role up to and     \nbeyond the transaction date. In addition to   \ncompensation and benefits protections during a\ntwo-yearprotection period after a change of   \ncontrol, the NEOs are entitled to severance   \nbenefits under the agreements if their        \nemployment is actually terminated as a result \nof (or in anticipation of) certain merger and \nacquisition scenarios.                        \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  100    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nBoth eligibility for participation and the    \nstructure of payments under these agreements  \nare designed to be aligned with market        \npractice in the banking and financial services\nindustry. Our program is designed so that our \nstockholders are not faced with               \ndisproportionate severance costs that may     \nimpair potential merger opportunities. In     \naddition, our change of control agreements for\nexecutive officers do not provide for excise  \ntax \u201cgross-up\u201dpayments. Projections of        \npotential payouts to the NEOs under these     \nagreements are included in the total          \ncompensation tally sheets reviewed by the     \nCommittee on an annual basis. Although the    \npotential change of control payouts do not    \nnecessarily impact annual decisions on NEO    \npay, reviewing this information allows the    \nCommittee to fully understand the downstream  \nimplications of its decisions and the         \nresulting impact to the Company and its       \nstockholders. Additional details regarding    \nthese agreements can be found under \u201cPayments \nUnder Certain Termination Scenarios\u201d beginning\non page 115. Post-Employment Compensation     \nPractices The CEO has no employment or        \nseverance arrangement with the Company other  \nthan the change of control agreement as       \ndescribed above. If an NEO, excluding the CEO,\nseparates from Capital One, they are entitled \nto receive the amounts set forth in the       \nCompany\u2019s Executive Severance Plan, which     \nprovides for a payment of up to 30% of the    \nNEO\u2019s then-current total target compensation  \nplus a pro-ratedseverance bonus based on the  \nNEO\u2019s target cash incentive in the event of   \ninvoluntary termination without cause due to  \nrestructuring. Additional benefits include    \npartially subsidized health, dental, and      \nvision benefits for a period of up to 18      \nmonths through continuation of health coverage\n(\u201cCOBRA\u201d), and outplacement services for a    \nperiod of up to one year following separation.\nThe Committee may exercise its discretion in  \napproving additional amounts in light of all  \nrelevant circumstances, including the NEO\u2019s   \nterm of employment, past accomplishments,     \nreasons for separation from the Company,      \npotential risks, and the NEO\u2019s willingness to \nrestrict their future action(s), such as      \nthrough an agreement not to compete or solicit\nthe Company\u2019s customers or associates. In     \naddition, following a separation from Capital \nOne, certain equity-based awards will continue\nto vest according to their original terms, as \ndescribed under \u201cPayments Under Certain       \nTermination Scenarios\u201d beginning on page 115. \nCapital One has entered into agreements with  \ncertain NEOs that contain restrictive         \ncovenants related to confidentiality, non-    \ncompetition, non-solicitation,and ownership of\nwork product. For additional information, see \n\u201cRestrictive Covenants\u201d beginning on page 114.\nUpon retiring from the Company, associates,   \nincluding the NEOs, will have access to a     \nvariety of medical plans through a private    \nexchange. Generally, retirees who meet the    \ncriteria for subsidized retiree medical       \ncoverage and enroll in a plan through the     \nprivate exchange will receive funding from    \nCapital One in a Health Reimbursement Account \n(\u201cHRA\u201d). NEOs who meet the retirement criteria\nmay also elect to receive 18 months of COBRA  \ncoverage. In addition, certain equity-based   \nawards will continue to vest according to     \ntheir original terms, as described under      \n\u201cPayments Upon Retirement\u201d beginning on page  \n115. Other Aspects of Executive Compensation  \nStock Ownership and Retention Requirements    \nConsistent with their responsibilities to our \nstockholders, the executive officers are      \nrequired to maintain a significant financial  \nstake in the Company. To this end, the CEO and\nthe other NEOs must own shares of Capital One \ncommon stock with a fair market value of at   \nleast the following (\u201cStock Ownership         \nRequirement\u201d):                                \n                                              \n                 Ownership\u00a0     Post-Termin\u2026  \n  Role           Requirement    Ownership\u00a0    \n                                Requirement   \n  CEO            $10.5\u00a0         $5.25\u00a0        \n                 million        million       \n  Other NEOs                                  \n  and            3x\u00a0annual\u00a0     1.5x\u00a0annual\u00a0  \n  Executive      cash\u00a0salary    cash\u00a0salary   \n  Officers                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           101  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nGiven that the CEO\u2019s compensation program does\nnot include a base salary, his Stock Ownership\nRequirement is based on an amount established \nannually by the Committee and the Independent \nDirectors. The CEO\u2019s Stock Ownership          \nRequirement was increased to an amount equal  \nto six multiplied by $1.75 million, or $10.5  \nmillion. In addition, the CEO and all other   \nNEOs are required to continue to hold 50% of  \ntheir Stock Ownership Requirement for one year\nfollowing termination, retirement, or ceasing \nto serve as an executive officer, except in   \ncase of termination by death, disability, or  \nin connection with a change of control. The   \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve that these Stock Ownership            \nRequirements have increased the alignment of  \nCEO and all other NEO compensation with       \nstockholder interests. Ownership requirements \nmay be fulfilled using the following shares:  \n                                         \n  \u220e    Shares owned without restriction  \n                                         \n                                  \n  \u220e    Unvested restricted stock  \n                                  \n                                    \n  \u220e    Unvested stock-settled RSUs  \n                                    \n                                              \n  \u220e    Shares acquired through the 2002       \n       Associate Stock Purchase Plan          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Shares owned through the Capital One   \n  \u220e    Stock Fund in Capital One\u2019s 401(k)     \n       plan                                   \n                                              \nUnexercised stock options and unvested        \nperformance share awards may not be used to   \nfulfill ownership requirements. The Committee \nreviews the guidelines and monitors the CEO\u2019s \nand the other NEOs\u2019 compliance with them. New \nexecutive officers are given five years from  \nthe date of promotion to or appointment as an \nexecutive officer to comply with the Stock    \nOwnership Requirements. In the event that an  \nexecutive officer is not in compliance with   \nthese requirements, the Committee has the     \nright to take action, including reducing the  \nexecutive officer\u2019s compensation. The CEO and \nall other NEOs are currently in compliance    \nwith this requirement. The Company has stock  \nretention requirements for certain equity     \nawards made to the CEO and the other NEOs.    \nWith respect to awards of performance shares  \nand stock-settled RSUs that vest (i) during an\nexecutive\u2019s term of employment with Capital   \nOne, or (ii) as applicable, prior to the first\nanniversary of such executive\u2019s separation    \nfrom Capital One, each executive must hold 50%\nof the after-taxnet shares acquired (\u201cRetained\nShares\u201d) for a period of one year after the   \nacquisition date of the shares. In addition,  \nfor performance shares and stock-settled RSUs \ngranted after January 2021, the Company       \nrequires that Retained Shares continue to be  \nheld beyond the one-yearperiod until the CEO  \nand the other NEOs\u2019 Stock Ownership           \nRequirement, as described above, is met. These\nstock ownership and retention requirements    \napply to all of our executive officers.       \nProhibition of Hedging, Speculative Trading   \nActivities, and Pledging As part of the       \ncommitment by Capital One\u2019s leadership team to\nmaintain public confidence in the long-term   \ngrowth of Capital One\u2019s stock, Capital One    \nmaintains a policy prohibiting hedging and    \nspeculative trading activities. Specifically, \nthe policy prohibits certain individuals from \nengaging in short sales, hedging transactions,\nor speculative trading in derivative          \nsecurities of Capital One stock. The policy   \napplies to all Capital One directors, officers\n(as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange  \nAct), and together with Capital One directors,\n\u201cControl Group Members\u201d), and associates who  \n(i) serve at the Senior Vice President level  \nor above, (ii) report directly to a Control   \nGroup Member, or (iii) are otherwise          \ndetermined by Capital One\u2019s General Counsel to\nbe an \u201cinsider.\u201d The policy applies to all    \nshares of Capital One stock held by those     \npersons covered by the policy, regardless of  \nwhether the stock was granted as compensation \nby Capital One or is otherwise held directly  \nor indirectly. Capital One also prohibits its \nControl Group Members from using Capital One  \nsecurities, including common stock, in a      \nmargin account or pledging Capital One        \nsecurities as collateral for a loan.          \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  102    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nEquity Grant Practices Capital One strives to \nmaintain equity grant practices that          \ndemonstrate high standards of corporate       \ngovernance. Annual incentive awards generally \nare approved by the Committee and the         \nIndependent Directors (or by authority        \ndelegated to the Chief Human Resources Officer\nfor certain associates who are not executive  \nofficers) at regularly scheduled meetings in  \nthe first quarter of each year. The date of   \ngrant is the actual date on which the         \nCommittee approves the awards. The Committee  \nmay grant awards of restricted stock, RSUs,   \nstock options, or other equity awards outside \nof the annual incentive cycle. The Committee  \nhas delegated authority to the CEO to award   \nrestricted stock and to the Chief Human       \nResources Officer to award stock-settled and  \ncash-settled RSUs (but not options or other   \nequity awards) to associates who are not      \nexecutive officers, subject to a maximum      \namount of $2 million for any associate in any \none year with an aggregate $50 million annual \nlimit. These awards are designed to be used   \nfor new hires and for special programs        \ndesigned by management to incentivize, retain,\nand reward current associates of the Company. \nThe Committee reviews all grants made by      \ndelegation at least once per year and approves\nall grants that exceed the annual delegation  \nlimit. With respect to awards of stock        \noptions, the exercise price is always the Fair\nMarket Value of Capital One common stock on   \nthe date of grant. Under the terms of our 2004\nStock Incentive Plan, \u201cFair Market Value\u201d is  \nequal to the closing price of Capital One     \ncommon stock on the date of grant. The Company\ndoes not seek to time equity grants to take   \nadvantage of material non-publicinformation,  \nand in no event is the grant date set to a    \ndate that is prior to the date of approval.   \nTax Considerations The Committee carefully    \nconsiders the tax impacts of its compensation \nprograms on the Company, as well as on its    \nexecutives. To maintain flexibility in        \ncompensating executive officers, the Committee\ndoes not require all compensation to be paid  \nor awarded in a tax-deductiblemanner.         \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           103  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection VII\u2014Named Executive Officer           \nCompensation 2023 Summary Compensation Table  \nThe Summary Compensation Table below provides \ninformation about compensation for the fiscal \nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 \nfor the NEOs.

Prior to  \nNovember 1995, Capital One offered a Cash     \nBalance Pension Plan (\u201cCBPP\u201d) and an Excess   \nCash Balance Pension Plan (\u201cExcess CBPP\u201d) to  \nall full-time salaried associates and certain \nexecutive officers. Both of these programs    \nwere frozen in December 1995; however,        \ninterest continues to accrue on plan balances \non a quarterly basis for the CBPP and on a    \nmonthly basis for the Excess CBPP. The CBPP   \ninterest rate changes annually, based on the  \naverage yield of five-year U.S. Treasury      \nSecurities for the month of October of the    \nprior plan year and is compounded quarterly   \n(4.25% effective annual interest crediting    \nrate for 2023). The Excess CBPP interest rate \nchanges monthly based on the Wall Street      \nJournal Prime Rate and is compounded monthly  \n(8.48% effective annual interest crediting    \nrate for 2023). Mr. Fairbank participated in  \nthese programs. The estimated annual payouts  \nupon retirement in the CBPP and the Excess    \nCBPP as of December 31, 2023, are $3,618 and  \n$14,015, respectively, for Mr. Fairbank. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the \u201cPresent Value of      \nAccumulated Benefit\u201d for Mr. Fairbank for both\nplans is equal to his account balance because \nMr. Fairbank has attained the normal          \nretirement age of 65 and so is assumed to     \nretire immediately under the actuarial        \nvaluation assumptions. Since Mr. Fairbank is  \nassumed to retire as of the measurement date, \nthe future interest rate does not apply. The  \naccount in each plan is distributed after any \nseparation from service. Distribution options \nfrom the CBPP plan are lump sum (eligible for \nrollover to another qualified plan or personal\nIRA) or an annuity option. The Excess CBPP    \nwill be distributed in the same form as the   \nCBPP, as a lump sum (not eligible for         \nrollover) or as an annuity. Since the CBPP and\nExcess CBPP are account-based defined benefit \nplans, years of service are not tracked.      \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           111  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Named Executive Officer       \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \n2023 Pension Benefits Table                   \n                                              \n                     Y\u2026        P\u2026        Pa\u2026  \n           P\u2026        of        V\u2026        Du\u2026  \n  \u2026        N\u2026        C\u2026        of        La\u2026  \n                     S\u2026        A\u2026        Fi\u2026  \n                               B\u2026        Ye\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        C\u2026        7\u2026        $\u2026        $\u2014   \n  \u2026                                           \n       E\u2026        7\u2026        $\u2026        $\u2014       \n       C\u2026                                     \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014          \u2014        $\u2014        $\u2014   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014          \u2014        $\u2014        $\u2014   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014          \u2014        $\u2014        $\u2014   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014          \u2014        $\u2014        $\u2014   \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       In November 1995, Capital One amended  \n       the CBPP and the Excess CBPP to        \n       eliminate further pay-based credits    \n       to participants as of December\u00a031,     \n       1995 and to provide that there would   \n       be no new participants in such plans   \n  (1)  on or after January\u00a01, 1996.

Capital One has     \nasked certain NEOs to enter into various      \nagreements that contain restrictive covenants \nrelated to confidentiality, non-competition,  \nnon-solicitation,and ownership of work        \nproduct, as described below. Non-             \nCompetitionAgreements Messrs. Alexander,      \nYajnik, and Young have entered into non-      \ncompetitionagreements with the Company        \npursuant to which they may be restricted as to\nwhat competitive services they may provide to \nan entity following separation from Capital   \nOne. These non-competitionagreements provide  \nfor the following in exchange for the NEO     \ncomplying with non-competitionrestrictions for\nup to two years following an involuntary      \ntermination, other than for cause, death, or  \ndisability: payment equal to 15% of the NEO\u2019s \ntotal target compensation for each year of    \nenforcement and subsidized health insurance   \npremiums for a period of up to 18 months      \nthrough COBRA if the NEO is eligible and      \nelects such coverage, subject to certain terms\nand conditions. The payments are made in two  \nlump sums: the first following termination and\nthe second upon successful completion of the  \nenforcement period. In the event of a         \nvoluntary termination, the previously         \ndescribed payments are typically made for the \nsecond year of enforcement for agreements with\na two-yearenforcement period. Confidentiality,\nWork Product, and No Hire/Non-Solicitationof  \nEmployee Agreement Messrs. Alexander, Yajnik, \nand Young are parties to confidentiality, work\nproduct, and no hire/non-solicitationof       \nemployee agreements. The confidentiality      \nprovisions of these agreements generally      \nprovide that at all times during and following\nemployment with the Company, these NEOs may   \nnot use for personal benefit or the benefit of\nothers, or divulge to others, any of Capital  \nOne\u2019s confidential information, except as     \nexpressly authorized by Capital One or        \nrequired by legal process. Mr. Yajnik\u2019s       \nagreement also provides that, for a period of \ntwo years following separation from Capital   \nOne, he shall not directly or indirectly      \nsolicit or induce any associate of Capital One\nto become employed by any person or entity    \nengaged in competition with Capital One, and  \nshall not directly or indirectly solicit or   \ninduce any associate of Capital One to end    \ntheir employment based on confidential        \ninformation learned about the associate while \nthey were employed by Capital One.            \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  114    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Named Executive Officer       \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nMr. Young\u2019s agreement also provides that, for \na period of two years following separation    \nfrom Capital One, he shall not, directly or   \nindirectly, (i) solicit or induce any covered \nCapital One associate to become employed by   \nany other person or entity, (ii) hire or      \notherwise engage any covered Capital One      \nassociate (or a person who was a covered      \nassociate and resigned in the prior three     \nmonths) to work for or provide services to any\nother person or entity, or (iii) solicit or   \ninduce any Capital One employee to leave or   \ncease their employment with Capital One, or to\nhire or otherwise engage any Capital One      \nemployee to work for or provide services to   \nany other person or entity, if based on       \nconfidential information he learned about such\nemployee while employed by Capital One. Mr.   \nAlexander\u2019s agreement is similar to that of   \nMr. Young, however, the restrictions on       \nsoliciting or hiring associates are limited to\nthose that join competitors, if not based on  \nconfidential information. Payments Under      \nCertain Termination Scenarios Upon separation \nfrom the Company, the NEOs, regardless of the \nreason for termination, receive certain       \nearned, but previously unpaid, payments, such \nas accrued but unused vacation pay and amounts\nvested under the Company\u2019s qualified and non- \nqualifiedretirement programs. In addition,    \ncash-settled RSUs granted to NEOs, other than \nthe CEO, after the end of a performance year  \ncontinue to vest according to the original    \nprovisions of such grants upon involuntary    \nseparation for any reason other than cause or \nas soon as practicable following a \u201cdouble    \ntrigger\u201d change of control (as discussed      \nbelow). Voluntary Termination An NEO, other   \nthan the CEO, who voluntarily terminates      \nemployment with Capital One may receive       \npayments related to non-competitioncovenants  \n(described above, if applicable) and any      \ncontractual payments to which the NEO may     \notherwise be entitled. In addition, the NEO   \nhas the ability following separation to       \nexercise vested but unexercised options for   \nthree months following voluntary termination. \nInvoluntary Termination Without Cause An NEO, \nother than the CEO, whose employment with     \nCapital One is terminated involuntarily, for  \nperformance or job elimination, is entitled to\nreceive the amounts set forth in the Company\u2019s\n(\u201cExecutive Severance Plan\u201d) in exchange for  \nexecuting a release of claims against the     \nCompany. For 2023, potential payments under   \nthe Executive Severance Plan were 30% of total\ntarget compensation, plus a severance bonus   \nbased on such NEO\u2019s target cash incentive in  \nthe event of termination due to restructuring.\nAdditional benefits include healthcare        \ncontinuation subsidy through COBRA,           \noutplacement services, and any contractual    \npayments to which the NEO may otherwise have  \nbeen entitled. Further, an NEO, other than the\nCEO, whose employment is terminated           \ninvoluntarily without cause and not due to    \ndeath or disability may receive payments      \nrelated to non-competitioncovenants (as       \ndescribed above, if applicable). Generally,   \nperformance shares granted to NEOs will vest  \nin full, based on actual Company performance  \nand stock-settled RSUs granted to NEOs will   \ncontinue to vest, subject to the NEO\u2019s        \nexecution of a release of claims against the  \nCompany. In addition, NEOs have the ability to\nexercise vested but unexercised options for   \ntwo years following separation. If an NEO\u2019s   \nemployment with Capital One is terminated as a\nresult of death or disability, the NEO\u2019s      \nunvested RSUs and performance shares will vest\nin full based on target Company performance.  \nPayments Upon Retirement As with all          \nexecutives who are eligible for retirement,   \nNEOs who retire from Capital One may receive  \nthe following amounts: payments related to    \nnon-competitioncovenants as if they had       \nterminated voluntarily (as described above);  \nup to 18 months of subsidized COBRA coverage; \nany contractual payments to which they may    \notherwise be entitled; and, for Messrs.       \nFairbank and Yajnik, who became eligible to   \nretire on or before December 31, 2012, a      \nretiree medical subsidy and access to a       \nvariety of medical plans through a private    \nexchange. Retirees eligible for subsidized    \nretiree medical coverage receive funding      \nthrough a HRA which can be used to pay for    \nhealth care insurance premiums or eligible    \nclaims expenses.                              \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           115  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Named Executive Officer       \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nUpon retirement, all RSUs continue to vest    \naccording to their original terms based on    \nactual performance, which, for stock-settled  \nRSUs granted, also includes performance-based \nvesting provisions. In addition, performance  \nshares granted to NEOs will continue to vest  \nafter retirement. For stock options, the      \nexecutive has until the expiration of the     \noption term to exercise vested but unexercised\noptions. Termination for Cause Generally, an  \nNEO whose employment with Capital One is      \nterminated for cause receives no additional   \nbenefits but is required to comply with any   \napplicable restrictive covenants related to   \nconfidentiality, non-competition, non-        \nsolicitationof associates or customers, and   \nownership of work product, as described above.\nIn addition, if terminated for cause, the NEOs\nhave the ability following separation to      \nexercise vested but unexercised options for   \nthree months. Change of Control Each NEO is a \nparty to an agreement (\u201cChange of Control     \nAgreement\u201d) that provides for certain payments\nin the event their employment is terminated   \nwithin two years following (or within one year\nprior to but in anticipation of) a change of  \ncontrol of Capital One, either involuntarily  \nwithout cause or voluntarily for good reason. \nAmounts payable in each of these scenarios are\noutlined below. Pursuant to the agreements, a \n\u201cchange of control\u201d occurs if one or more of  \nthe following events take place: (i) an       \nacquisition of 20% or more of Capital One     \ncommon stock or the combined voting power of  \nthe voting securities of Capital One by a     \nperson or group, (ii) certain changes in the  \nmajority of the Board, (iii) consummation of a\nreorganization, merger, share exchange or     \nconsolidation or similar transaction, sale of \nall assets or the acquisition of another      \ncompany, except where all or substantially all\nof Capital One\u2019s stockholders receive 50% or  \nmore of the stock of the resulting company, at\nleast a majority of the board of directors of \nthe resulting company were incumbent Board    \nmembers, and no person owns 20% or more of the\nresulting company who did not own such stock  \nimmediately before the business combination,  \nor (iv) approval by stockholders of a complete\nliquidation or dissolution of Capital One. In \nthe event of a change of control, we do not   \nprovide for excise tax gross-uppayments. In   \naddition, all equity awards granted to the    \nNEOs require a so-called\u201cdouble trigger\u201d for  \naccelerated vesting in connection with a      \nchange of control. Upon a change of control,  \nall equity awards continue to vest according  \nto their original schedule. The vesting of    \nsuch awards only accelerates if an NEO is     \ninvoluntarily terminated without cause or     \nvoluntarily terminates for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as  \ndefined in the agreements) within the two     \nyears following a change of control.          \nTermination for Cause in Connection with a    \nChange of Control NEOs terminated             \ninvoluntarily for cause following a change of \ncontrol receive no additional benefits except \nwith regard to options, which allow NEOs to   \nexercise vested but unexercised options for   \nthree months following a termination for      \ncause. Voluntary Termination with Good Reason \nor Involuntary Termination Without Cause in   \nConnection with a Change of Control In the    \nevent of a voluntary termination with good    \nreason or an involuntary termination without  \ncause, the potential payments that the NEOs   \ncould receive under certain termination       \nscenarios are based on a percentage of total  \ntarget compensation. For the CEO, the         \npotential payments are based on a multiple of \nhis notional salary and his year-endincentive \nopportunity. If a change of control of Capital\nOne had occurred as of December 31, 2023, then\nfollowing a voluntary termination with good   \nreason or involuntary termination without     \ncause, an NEO would have received certain     \nbenefits as outlined below: The CEO would be  \nentitled to receive:                          \n                                              \n       A lump-sum payment of two and one      \n       half times the sum of his current      \n       notional salary and the \u201cHighest       \n       Annual Bonus,\u201d which is the highest    \n  \u220e    of (i)\u00a0the deferred cash bonus for     \n       the year in which the change of        \n       control occurs (or the mid-point if    \n       no target is established), (ii) the    \n       deferred cash bonus for the year       \n                                              \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  116    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Named Executive Officer       \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  immediately before the year the change of   \n  control                                     \n  occurs (or midpoint if no target is         \n  established),                               \n  or (iii) the deferred cash bonus paid or    \n  payable                                     \n  for the most recently completed fiscal      \n  year;

Estimated Ratio  \nof CEO Compensation to Median Employee        \nCompensation As required by Section 953(b) of \nthe Dodd-Frank Act, and Item 402(u) of        \nRegulation S-K,we are providing the following \ninformation about the ratio of the annual     \ntotal compensation, calculated in accordance  \nwith the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of \nRegulation S-K(\u201cAnnual Total Compensation\u201d) of\nour median employee and the Annual Total      \nCompensation of our CEO, Richard D. Fairbank. \nFor 2023, our last completed fiscal year:     \n                                              \n  \u220e    The Annual Total Compensation of our   \n       median employee was $93,157            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The Annual Total Compensation of Mr.\u00a0  \n       Fairbank was $28,589,573               \n                                              \nAccordingly, the ratio of Mr. Fairbank\u2019s      \nAnnual Total Compensation to the median       \nemployee\u2019s Annual Total Compensation was 307  \nto 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate     \ncalculated in a manner consistent with Item   \n402(u) of Regulation S-K. In determining our  \nmedian employee for 2023, in accordance with  \nSEC rules we have concluded that it would be  \nappropriate to: (i) rely on the process we    \nundertook in 2022 to identify the median      \nemployee (as described in our 2023 Proxy      \nStatement), because we believe that since the \n2022 determination, there has been no change  \nin our employee population or employee        \ncompensation arrangements that would          \nsignificantly impact our pay ratio; and (ii)  \nsubstitute the median employee for 2022 with  \nanother similarly compensated employee for    \n2023. We determined the 2022 median           \ncompensated employee of our global employee   \npopulation of 54,555 as of October 1, 2022    \n(the \u201cDetermination Date\u201d) by comparing a     \nconsistently applied compensation measure     \nconsisting of salary, wages (including        \novertime), bonuses and commissions paid to our\nemployees over the twelve-month period        \npreceding the Determination Date (the         \n\u201cEstimated Compensation\u201d). Based on the       \nEstimated Compensation of each employee, we   \nidentified a cohort of 61 employees,          \nconsisting of the employee with the median    \nEstimated Compensation value and the 30       \nemployees above and 30 employees below that   \nemployee (the \u201cMedian Cohort\u201d). We then       \nremoved ten employees from the Median Cohort  \nwho appeared to bear anomalous characteristics\n(such as participation in non-U.S.compensation\nprograms, a hire date during the fiscal year, \nor separation prior to the end of the fiscal  \nyear) that could significantly distort the pay\nratio calculation, and then identified the    \nmedian employee from the remaining employees  \nin the Median Cohort. The SEC\u2019s rules for     \nidentifying the median compensated employee   \nand calculating the pay ratio based on that   \nemployee\u2019s Annual Total Compensation allow    \ncompanies to adopt a variety of methodologies,\nto apply certain exclusions, and to make      \nreasonable estimates and assumptions that     \nreflect their employee populations and        \ncompensation practices. As a result, the pay  \nratio reported by other companies may not be  \ncomparable to the pay ratio reported above, as\nother companies have different employee       \npopulations and compensation practices and may\nutilize different methodologies, exclusions,  \nestimates, and assumptions in calculating     \ntheir own pay ratios.                         \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           119  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Named Executive Officer       \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nPay versus Performance                        \nAs required by Section\u00a0953(a) of the Dodd-\nFrank Act, we are providing the information\nbelow to illustrate the relationship between\nthe SEC-defined compensation actually paid\n(\u201cCAP\u201d) and various measures used to gauge the\nCompany\u2019s financial performance in conformance\nwith Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K.

This alignment\nis due to the Company\u2019s executive compensation\nprogram being comprised of primarily equity,  \nwith 83% of PEO and approximately 49% of all  \nNon-PEONEO\u2019s total compensation for the 2023  \nperformance year being comprised of equity-   \nbased compensation, similar to prior years. In\naddition, a portion of PEO compensation is    \ndirectly linked to the Company\u2019s TSR and vests\nentirely on the Company\u2019s TSR performance     \nrelative to the Performance Share Peers over a\nthree-year period. CAP versus Net Income As   \nshown in the chart above, the Company\u2019s net   \nincome has varied over the measurement period.\nWhile net income has increased and decreased  \ndirectionally with PEO and other NEO CAP, the \nchanges are not proportionally correlated with\nCAP. This is due in large part to the large   \nportion of PEO and other NEO compensation that\nis equity-based compensation as well as the   \nsignificant volatility of GAAP net income that\nresulted from the pandemic covered by a       \nportion of the measurement period. In         \naddition, while net income is one of several  \nfactors used to assess Company performance,   \nthe Company does not use net income as a      \nprimary metric to determine compensation      \nlevels or incentive plan payout. CAP versus   \nD+TBV As shown in the chart above, the PEO and\nother NEO\u2019s CAP amounts are aligned with the  \nCompany selected measure of D+TBV. This       \nalignment is partially due to a large portion \nof PEO and other NEO compensation being       \ncomprised of Financial Performance Shares (as \ndescribed on page 78). For the 2023           \nperformance year, 43% of PEO total            \ncompensation and an average of 27% of other   \nNEO total compensation was granted in the form\nof Financial Performance Shares, similar to   \nprior years. Two-thirdsof the payout of each  \nFinancial Performance Share upon vesting is   \nbased on D+TBV. Company TSR versus Peer Group \nTSR As shown in the chart above, the TSR peer \ngroup is based on the S&P Financial Index,    \nwhich reflects the Company\u2019s industry sector. \nThe Company\u2019s cumulative TSR was above that of\nthe S&P Financial Index during the period     \ncovered by the table above. The financial     \nservices industry faced challenges over the   \nmeasured period including a pandemic-driven   \nrecession, substantial changes in interest    \nrates, and regional bank failures. The        \nstability of Capital One\u2019s deposit base and   \nstrength of our credit performance relative to\npeers, coupled with investor confidence in our\nresults and our future, buoyed our stock      \nprice. Company Selected Measures When         \ndetermining the compensation paid to our NEOs,\nthe Committee and the Independent Directors   \nconsider the Company\u2019s performance against    \nfour categories of quantitative and           \nqualitative performance factors related to:   \nfinancial and operating performance,          \ngovernance and risk management, strategic     \nperformance, and winning with our customers   \nand associates.

Net      \n       revenue serves as the key driver for   \n       long-term earnings power and requires  \n       delivery of compelling products and    \n       experiences as well as a sustainable,  \n       through-cycle pricing strategy and     \n       business model.                        \n                                              \nThe Committee and the Independent Directors   \nbelieve these three financial metrics provide \na measure of Company performance that balances\ncreation of stockholder value, returns        \ngenerated on stockholders\u2019 investment in the  \nCompany, and long-term financial              \nsustainability. Each of the metrics are       \nconsidered in the award and/or payout of      \ncompensation awarded to our NEOs under the    \nexecutive compensation program for each of the\nperformance years shown in the tables above.  \nD+TBV and Adjusted ROTCE are both earnings and\nprofit-driven measures that have shown to be  \nstrong indicators of long-term stockholder    \nvalue. These two metrics, in combination, are \nused to determine the amount paid to our NEOs \nupon the vesting of the Financial Performance \nShares, which represented 43% of 2023         \nperformance year compensation awarded to our  \nCEO and approximately 27% of the performance  \nyear compensation awarded to our non-CEONEOs  \nfor the 2023 performance year. For additional \ninformation on the composition of the         \nFinancial Performance Shares see \u201cPerformance \nShare Awards\u201d beginning on page 77. Earnings  \nand profit-driven measures, such as D+TBV and \nAdjusted ROTCE can be affected by the pace and\nlevel of long-term investment in areas like   \ntalent, technology, and marketing as well as  \nshort-term or cyclical factors such as credit \ncosts. As such, the Committee and the         \nIndependent Directors believe that net        \nrevenue, and the growth of net revenue to be  \nimportant complements to earnings-driven      \nmeasures and important indicators of Capital  \nOne\u2019s financial strength, growth trajectory,  \nand long-term sustainability.                 \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  122    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection VIII - Equity Compensation Plans      \nEquity Compensation Plan Information The      \nfollowing table provides information as of    \nDecember 31, 2023, with respect to our equity \ncompensation plans under which shares of      \nCapital One common stock are authorized to be \nissued.                                       \n                                              \n                                      Number  \n                                          of  \n               Number               securit\u2026  \n                   of               remaini\u2026  \n             securit\u2026    Weight\u2026    availab\u2026  \n                to be    exerci\u2026         for  \n               issued      price      future  \n                 upon         of    issuance  \n             exercise    outsta\u2026       under  \n                   of    option\u2026      equity  \n             outstan\u2026    warran\u2026    compens\u2026  \n             options,        and       plans  \n             warrants     rights    (exclud\u2026  \n                  and               securit\u2026  \n               rights               reflect\u2026  \n                                          in  \n                                      column  \n                                        (a))  \n  Plan             -a         -b          -c  \n  Catego\u2026                                     \n  Equity                                      \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plans                                       \n  approv\u2026    9,273,7\u2026     $75.46    26,268,\u2026  \n  by                                          \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  holder\u2026                                     \n  Equity                                      \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plans                                       \n  not        24,340(\u2026         $\u2014        0(5)  \n  approv\u2026                                     \n  by                                          \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  holders                                     \n  Total      9,298,1\u2026     $75.46    26,268,\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The following plans have been          \n       approved by our stockholders and are   \n  (1)  currently in effect: the 2004 Stock    \n       Incentive Plan and the 2002 Associate  \n       Stock Purchase Plan.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Excludes purchase rights accruing      \n       under the 2002 Associate Stock         \n       Purchase Plan.

The Audit  \nCommittee evaluates the independent registered\npublic accounting firm\u2019s qualifications,      \nperformance, and independence at least        \nannually and periodically considers whether to\ncontinue to retain our current independent    \nregistered public accounting firm or whether  \nto engage another firm. In connection with    \napplicable partner rotation requirements, the \nAudit Committee and its Chair are involved in \nconsidering the selection of the independent  \nregistered public accounting firm\u2019s new lead  \npartner. Additionally, Capital One adheres to \nthe requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    \nrelating to the rotation of partners engaged  \nin Capital One\u2019s audit by the independent     \nregistered public accounting firm. For 2024,  \nthe Audit Committee has appointed Ernst &     \nYoung LLP (\u201cErnst & Young\u201d) as Capital One\u2019s  \nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nErnst & Young has served in this role since   \n1994. The members of the Audit Committee and  \nthe Board believe that the continued retention\nof Ernst & Young as Capital One\u2019s independent \nregistered public accounting firm is in the   \nbest interests of Capital One and its         \nstockholders. The Board is submitting this    \nproposal to the vote of the stockholders as a \nmatter of good corporate governance. If       \nstockholders do not ratify the selection of   \nErnst & Young, the Audit Committee will       \nreconsider the appointment of Ernst & Young as\nthe Company\u2019s independent registered public   \naccounting firm. Even if the selection is     \nratified, the Audit Committee may, in its     \ndiscretion, appoint a different independent   \nregistered public accounting firm at any time \nduring the year if the Audit Committee        \ndetermines that such a change would be in our \nstockholders\u2019 best interests.

The  \nAudit Committee has reviewed the fees paid to \nErnst & Young and has considered whether the  \nfees paid for non-Auditservices are compatible\nwith maintaining Ernst & Young\u2019s independence.\nThe Audit Committee also adopted policies and \nprocedures to approve services provided by    \nErnst & Young in accordance with the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act and rules of the SEC promulgated    \nthereunder. These policies and procedures     \ninvolve annual pre-approvalby the Audit       \nCommittee of the types of services to be      \nprovided by Ernst & Young. Any service        \nengagements that exceed these pre-            \napprovedlimits must be submitted to the Audit \nCommittee for specific pre-approval.If the    \nactual expenditure for pre-approvedservices is\nanticipated to exceed, or exceeds, the pre-   \napprovedcost levels by more than $50,000, the \nincremental amount requires separate approval \nby the Audit Committee. In 2023, all of the   \nAudit and Audit-Related Fees and related      \nservices were pre-approvedby the Audit        \nCommittee pursuant to the policies and        \nprocedures described above. Under the policy  \nadopted by the Audit Committee, Tax Fees are  \nlimited to 25% of combined Audit and Audit-   \nRelated Fees, and services that would fall    \nunder the category \u201cAll Other Fees\u201d are       \nprohibited. One or more representatives of    \nErnst & Young are expected to be present at   \nthe 2024 Annual Stockholder Meeting. They will\nhave the opportunity to make a statement if   \nthey desire to do so and will be available to \nrespond to appropriate questions from         \nstockholders. *** The Board unanimously       \nrecommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the            \nratification of Ernst & Young LLP as Capital  \nOne\u2019s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2024.                                \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           129  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                 \n  AUDIT MATTERS  \n                 \nSection XII - Audit Committee Report Roles and\nResponsibilities of the Audit Committee In    \naccordance with its charter, the Audit        \nCommittee assists the Board in fulfilling its \nobligations with respect to the items listed  \nin \u201cCommittee Responsibilities\u201d on page 41.   \nOur Audit Committee is composed of five Board \nmembers. Each member of the Audit Committee is\n\u201cfinancially literate\u201d in the judgment of the \nBoard. No member of the Audit Committee       \nsimultaneously serves on the audit committees \nof more than three public companies, including\nthat of Capital One. Audit Committee Policies \nand Procedures The Audit Committee has        \nimplemented procedures to enable it to devote \nthe attention it deems appropriate to each of \nthe matters assigned to it under its charter, \nincluding candid communications with          \nmanagement and Ernst & Young, Capital One\u2019s   \nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nto discuss new auditing standards and emerging\naudit-related issues. In carrying out its     \nresponsibilities, the Audit Committee met a   \ntotal of ten times during 2023. Pursuant to   \nCapital One\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines \nand applicable law, the Audit Committee is    \ncomprised solely of independent directors.    \nRequired Communications with Ernst & Young In \ndischarging its oversight responsibility      \nthroughout the year, the Audit Committee      \nproactively engaged with management and Ernst \n& Young on matters relating to Capital One\u2019s  \nfinancial reporting. The Audit Committee has  \nreviewed and discussed Capital One\u2019s audited  \nfinancial statements for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and the assessment of the  \neffectiveness of Capital One\u2019s internal       \ncontrol over financial reporting, with        \nmanagement and Ernst & Young. The Audit       \nCommittee has also discussed with Ernst &     \nYoung the applicable requirements of the      \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board and \nthe SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee has \nreceived the written disclosures and the      \nletter from Ernst & Young required by the     \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board     \nregarding Ernst & Young\u2019s communications with \nthe Audit Committee concerning independence   \nand has discussed with Ernst & Young their    \nindependence from Capital One.

The New    \nYork State Common Retirement Fund has         \nsubmitted documentation indicating that it is \nthe beneficial owner of no fewer than $25,000 \nworth of shares of Capital One common stock.  \nStockholder Proposal The resolution being     \nsubmitted by the Comptroller of the State of  \nNew York to the stockholders for approval, if \nproperly presented, is as follows: Proposal 5 \n\u2014 Setting of Near- and Long-Term Greenhouse   \nGas Emission Reduction Targets Title: Adopt   \nTargets for lending and Investment Activities \nWhereas Capital One Financial Corporation     \n(\u201cCapital One\u201d) recognizes numerous physical  \nand transition risks of climate change to     \ntheir operations in their 2022 ESG Report, and\ninvestors applaud Capital One\u2019s 2030          \ncommitment to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 3      \n(category 1\u201314 only) emissions by 50 percent  \nfrom the bank\u2019s 2019 baseline. However,       \ninvestors remain concerned that Capital One\u2019s \ndelay in setting a net zero commitment for its\nlending and investment activities signals     \nlagging climate action. Capital One has       \nsubstantial exposure to the real estate,      \ncommercial and industrial sectors through its \ncommercial banking loans and investments. The \nreal estate sector accounts for nearly a      \nquarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in the\nUnited States, 1and an analysis shows that    \nsome of the largest sources of GHG in the real\nestate sector are small-medium-sizedretail and\nmultifamily properties \u2014 all property segments\nmuch more likely to be financed by smaller    \nregional banks such as Capital One, as opposed\nto large national banks. Research shows that, \non average, a financial institution\u2019s financed\nemissions are 700 times greater than its      \ndirect emissions, 2indicating that Capital One\nis addressing only a fraction of its total    \nclimate risk. The Intergovernmental Panel on  \nClimate Change says global greenhouse gas     \n(GHG) emissions must be cut by 45% by 2030 to \nachieve net zero by 2050 and meet the Paris   \nAgreement\u2019s goal to limit warming to 1.5      \ndegrees Celsius and avoid the worst impacts of\nclimate change. Every incremental increase in \ntemperature above 1.5\u00b0C will entail           \nincreasingly severe physical, transition, and \nsystemic risks to companies, investors, the   \nmarkets, and the economy as a whole. Capital  \nOne may face serious business risks associated\nwith financing projects or companies that lack\nalignment with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals. In\ncontrast to Capital One, competitors have     \ntaken steps to address Scope 3 emissions.     \nRegional banks Truist Financial Corp 3and U.S.\nBancorp 4have both announced a goal to achieve\nnet zero GHG emissions by 2050 and disclose   \n2030 targets for selected carbon-intensive    \nindustries in their portfolio.                \nResolved:Shareholders request that Capital One\nset near- and long-term greenhouse gas        \nemission reduction targets aligned with the   \nParis Agreement\u2019s ambition to limit warming to\n1.5 degrees Celsius for its lending and       \ninvestment activities.                        \n                                              \n  1  https://www2.itif.org/2022-doe-buildin\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  2  https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://ir.truist.com/2022-01-27-Truis\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://www.usbank.com/about-us-bank/c\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           131  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XIII - Stockholder Proposals        \n  (Items 5-7 on                               \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nSupporting Statement:In assessing targets,    \nproponents recommend the following, but defer \nto Board and management discretion:           \n                                              \n       Disclosure of the Company\u2019s            \n       comprehensive financed emissions       \n  \u220e    associated with the lending and        \n       investment activities for its          \n       highest-emitting sectors (Scope 3);    \n                                              \n                                              \n       A commitment to reach the Company\u2019s    \n  \u220e    net zero GHG emissions by 2050 or      \n       sooner;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       A near-term (2030 or sooner) target    \n  \u220e    for Scope 3 emissions related to its   \n       lending and investments activities in  \n       the highest-emitting sectors; and      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Consideration of approaches used by    \n  \u220e    advisory groups such as the Science    \n       Based Targets initiative.              \n                                              \nStatement in Opposition to the Stockholder    \nProposal We believe that climate change, and  \nthe associated efforts to address it, will be \none of the biggest influences on the world in \nthe decades ahead. We recognize that financial\ninstitutions like Capital One can play an     \nimportant role in addressing the future       \nimpacts of climate change, and we are         \ncommitted to continuously improving the       \nenvironmental sustainability of our business. \nWe already have taken significant steps to    \nreduce our greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions,  \nincluding by establishing Scope 1 and Scope 3 \n(Categories 1-14)reduction targets, committing\nourselves to purchasing 100% renewable energy,\nand working to refine the methodologies and   \ninfrastructure necessary to support potential \nfuture disclosures of financed emissions. We  \nare striving to make progress in a            \nresponsible, measured manner, and we believe  \nthat the Stockholder Proposal fails to take   \ninto account the significant complexities and \nuncertainties of setting GHG emissions        \nreduction targets that include financed       \nemissions. Accordingly, the Board unanimously \nrecommends that you vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the        \nStockholder Proposal. Capital One currently   \nhas clear goals to reduce its operational     \nemissions across its business operations, and \nis making progress toward those goals. As the \nStockholder Proposal recognizes, in 2020, we  \ncommitted to the following goals to reduce our\noperational emissions:                        \n                                              \n       Reduce Scope 1 Direct Emissions by 50  \n  \u220e    percent by 2030 (from a baseline year  \n       of 2019)                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Continue to purchase 100% renewable    \n  \u220e    electricity while increasing           \n       location-aligned procurement in the    \n       markets where we operate               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Reduce Scope 3 Emissions (Categories   \n  \u220e    1-14) by 50\u00a0percent by 2030 (from a    \n       baseline year of 2019)                 \n                                              \nOur emissions reduction targets are aligned   \nwith a global 1.5\u00b0C target ambition, and we   \nbelieve the actions we are taking today will  \nposition us well to make appropriate progress \ntoward our targets in the years ahead. Over   \nthe past few years, we have continued to      \nevolve our methodology for estimating         \noperational emissions, and have conducted     \nanalyses to better understand the business    \ndrivers that shape those emissions, including \nin areas related to corporate real estate,    \nmarketing strategies and mix, corporate       \ntravel, commuting, and emissions intensity    \nimprovements of major suppliers. We have been \nimplementing measures to reduce our           \noperational emissions, such as energy         \nefficiency investments, refrigerant leak      \nmonitoring, and the installation of on-       \nsitesolar at our campuses. We have also been  \nengaging our suppliers to both advance our    \nemissions estimates and identify actions for  \nthem to decrease their emissions.

Financed\nemissions are the GHG emissions associated    \nwith our lending activities and investments   \n(Scope 3, Category 15). We are currently      \nworking to refine our methodologies, data and \nprocesses to accurately estimate our financed \nemissions. For example, in 2023, we joined the\nPCAF, an industry-ledinitiative that is       \ndeveloping standards to enable financial      \ninstitutions to measure implied emissions of  \nloans and investments. While we are making    \nprogress toward accurately estimating our     \nfinanced emissions, doing so remains a major  \nundertaking given the size and diversity of   \nour loan portfolios, in addition to the fact  \nthat many of the businesses to which we lend  \ndo not have accurate and reliable processes to\nmeasure their own emissions. Given the        \nchallenges in accurately estimating our       \nfinanced emissions, we do not believe it would\nbe possible to set a meaningful, realistic    \nfinanced emissions reduction target at this   \ntime, or reliably measure progress against    \nsuch a target. Indeed, the SEC recently       \nadopted its final climate disclosure rules and\ndecided to exclude Scope 3 emissions from     \ndisclosure requirements, even though Scope 3  \nemissions were included in its proposed rules \nfrom March 2022. The SEC Chairman announced   \nthe SEC decided to exclude Scope 3 emissions  \nbased on public feedback, which feedback      \nincluded widespread concern about a public    \nfiler\u2019s ability to accurately estimate such   \nemissions. Relatedly, in October 2023,        \nCalifornia passed legislation that will       \nrequire us to provide wide-ranging GHG        \nemissions disclosures. We are currently       \nevaluating these requirements and their       \npotential impact, but they underscore the     \nimportance of accurately estimating our       \nfinanced emissions and ensuring that any      \nreduction targets we set are achievable.      \nMoreover, given the nature of our business,   \nreducing our financed emissions is dependent  \non many factors, some of which are beyond our \ncontrol, including political, economic,       \nregulatory, scientific, and geopolitical      \nconditions. In certain instances, reducing our\nfinanced emissions would require              \ndecarbonization across broad sectors of the   \neconomy or across the economy as a whole. This\nis particularly true for consumer businesses. \nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately 95% of \nCapital One\u2019s total net revenue was from our  \nCredit Card and Consumer Banking segments,    \nwhich primarily consist of services to        \nconsumer and small business customers. For    \nexample, achieving an Auto Finance business   \nwith minimal financed emissions would require \na nearly complete transition to EVs across our\ncustomer base and a significant greening of   \nthe grid that charges EVs. Even if U.S. new   \ncar sales were to be nearly all EVs, the used \ncar market, to which we have significant      \nlending, would have substantial numbers of    \ntraditional vehicles for many years after     \nthat. Given the factors impacting financed    \nemissions from consumer businesses, it is not \nsurprising that most major consumer lenders   \nhave not made net zero commitments for their  \nlending and investment activities at this     \ntime. In light of these complex factors and   \nuncertainties, we believe that setting        \nemissions reduction targets that include      \nfinanced emissions at this time would be      \npremature. Capital One has a robust climate   \nrisk management strategy in place with        \nappropriate flexibility to address the complex\nand evolving challenges of climate change. We \nhave enhanced our governance and oversight of \nour climate-related bodies of work. We have   \nalso instituted several climate-specific      \ngovernance processes at both the enterprise   \nand line of business levels. Climate          \ngovernance is integrated into our overall     \ngovernance framework at all levels of our     \nCompany, including the Board and senior       \nmanagement levels. In addition, climate risk  \nis embedded in our enterprise-wide risk       \nmanagement framework. We identify, manage, and\nrespond to climate-related risks through our  \nrisk identification process, incremental      \nclimate risk analysis, and the ongoing        \ninteraction between senior management and the \nBoard. We evaluate climate risks as they arise\nwithin our seven risk categories\u2013credit,      \noperational, strategic, reputation, market,   \nliquidity, and compliance risks\u2013as well as    \nthrough our identification of emerging risks. \nWe believe that our robust climate governance \nand climate risk processes, which are         \nintegrated into our enterprise-wide           \nframeworks, position us well to execute on our\nclimate strategy in a highly dynamic          \nenvironment.                                  \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           133  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XIII - Stockholder Proposals        \n  (Items 5-7 on                               \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nWe believe that it is important to address    \nenvironmental sustainability in a responsible,\nmeasured manner, recognizing both the wide-   \nranging impact of climate change and its      \ncomplex and evolving challenges.

Stockholder Proposal The        \nresolution being submitted by the National    \nCenter for Public Policy Research to the      \nstockholders for approval, if properly        \npresented, is as follows: Proposal 6 \u2014 Report \non Respecting Workforce Civil Liberties       \nSupporting Statement:Capital One (the         \n\u201cCompany\u201d) employs more than 50,000 people. It\nshould respect its employees\u2019 speech rights   \nand religious freedom. Company legally must   \ncomply with many laws prohibiting             \ndiscrimination against employees on many      \ngrounds, including religion and sometimes     \npolitical affiliation. Respecting diverse     \nviews allows Company to attract the most      \nqualified talent, promote a healthy and       \ninnovative business culture, and contribute to\na healthy economic market and marketplace of  \nideas. Despite this, the Viewpoint Diversity  \nScore Business Index (2023)1 found 91% of     \nscored companies promote divisive training    \nconcepts like critical race theory (CRT) that \nreplace rich cultural and ideological         \ndiversity with a monolithic focus on group    \nidentity. Capital One goes further, from      \ntraining to practice. It appears to inject the\nillegal considerations of race and sex into   \nevery supplier-recruitment decision, and to   \noffer training programs and growth            \nopportunities exclusively to race, sex and    \norientation groups it favors, thus            \ndiscriminating against \u201cnon-diverse\u201d          \nsuppliers. 1And despite the fact that Capital \nOne actively discriminates against disfavored \n\u201cnon-diverse\u201dpeople such as whites, men and   \nstraight people, none of those groups is      \nrepresented by any \u201cbusiness resource groups,\u201d\nwhile favored, \u201cdiverse\u201d groups to whose      \nbenefit Company\u2019s discrimination runs have a  \nseries of surface-characteristic-based        \nlobbying groups. 2This speaks to systemic     \ndiscrimination at Capital One against the     \n\u201cnon-diverse.\u201d Many companies also alienate   \ntheir own employees by taking divisive stances\non political and social issues. The 2023 Index\nfound 78% of scored companies discriminated   \nagainst religious nonprofits in company       \nprograms, and 63% supported legislation       \nundermining fundamental First Amendment       \nfreedoms.

The Company has established in\nits bylaws a majority vote standard for use in\nan uncontested director election, an election \nin which the number of nominees equal the     \nnumber of open board seats. Under applicable  \nstate corporate law, a director\u2019s term extends\nuntil his or her successor is elected and     \nqualified, or until he or she resigns or is   \nremoved from office. Therefore, an incumbent  \ndirector who fails to receive the required    \nvote for election under a majority vote       \nstandard continues to serve as a \u201choldover\u201d   \ndirector until the next meeting of            \nshareholders. A Company governance policy     \ncurrently addresses the continued status of an\nincumbent director who fails to be re-        \nelectedby requiring such director to tender   \nhis or her resignation for Board              \nconsideration. The new director resignation   \nbylaw will set a more demanding standard of   \nreview for addressing director resignations   \nthen that contained in the Company\u2019s          \nresignation governance policy. The resignation\nbylaw will require the reviewing directors to \narticulate a compelling reason or reasons for \nnot accepting a tendered resignation and      \nallowing an un-electeddirector to continue to \nserve as a \u201choldover\u201d director. Importantly,  \nif a director\u2019s resignation is not accepted   \nand he or she continues as a \u201choldover\u201d       \ndirector but again fails to be elected at the \nnext annual meeting of shareholders, that     \ndirector\u2019s new tendered resignation will be   \nautomatically effective 30 days following the \nelection vote certification. While providing  \nthe Board latitude to accept or not accept the\ninitial resignation of an incumbent director  \nthat fails to receive majority vote support,  \nthe amended bylaw will establish the          \nshareholder vote as the final word when a     \ncontinuing \u201choldover\u201d director is not re-     \nelected.The Proposal\u2019s enhancement of the     \ndirector resignation process will establish   \nshareholder voting in director elections as a \nmore consequential governance right. Statement\nin Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal     \nCapital One\u2019s existing governance practices   \nand policies already ensure that its Board is \nfully accountable to its stockholders and a   \nmandatory director resignation is unnecessary \nin light of its extensive governance practices\nand policies. Accordingly, the Board          \nunanimously recommends that you vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Stockholder Proposal. We currently have a \ndirector resignation policy that requires our \ndirectors to offer to resign if they do not   \nreceive majority support from stockholders. To\nmitigate against concerns about having        \nholdover directors on our Board, our Amended  \nand Restated Corporate Governance Guidelines  \n(our \u201cCorporate Governance Guidelines\u201d)       \nrequire, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws  \n(our \u201cBylaws\u201d) permit, that any nominee for   \ndirector in an uncontested election (i.e., an \nelection where the only nominees are those    \nnominated by our Board) who receives a greater\nnumber of votes \u201cagainst\u201d their election than \nvotes \u201cfor\u201d such election shall tender their  \nresignation to the Chair of our Board within  \nfive business days following certification of \nthe stockholder vote on the election of such  \ndirector. Our Governance and Nominating       \nCommittee is required to consider the         \nresignation offer and recommend to our Board  \nwhether to accept it. Our Board will then take\naction on the Governance and Nominating       \nCommittee\u2019s recommendation within 90 days     \nfollowing the submission of the director\u2019s    \nresignation. We will then disclose our Board\u2019s\ndecision and provide an explanation of its    \nprocess and the factors it considered by way  \nof a filing with the SEC. Any director who    \ntenders their resignation as set forth above  \nis expected to recuse themself from the       \nGovernance and Nominating Committee           \nrecommendation or Board action regarding      \nwhether to accept such resignation. As        \ndescribed above, our governing documents      \nalready set forth a process that deals with   \nthe concerns raised in the proposal regarding \nholdover directors. The process provides a    \nbalanced approach that ensures our Board has  \nappropriate discretion to act in the best     \ninterests of our Company and our stockholders \nto either accept a director\u2019s resignation or  \ntake any other action it deems necessary to   \naddress the concerns that led to the election \nresults for that incumbent director. Since we \nadopted a majority voting standard in 2007, no\ndirector has received less than a majority of \nthe votes cast for their election. Our Board  \ntakes seriously its responsibilities under our\ngoverning documents, and would                \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           137  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XIII - Stockholder Proposals        \n  (Items 5-7 on                               \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \ncarefully review whether to accept the        \nresignation of an incumbent director who      \nreceives less than majority support, in       \naccordance with our Corporate Governance      \nGuidelines. The proposal would unduly restrict\nthe role of the Board by stipulating that in  \nthe event a director fails to receive majority\nsupport two years in a row, the director\u2019s    \ntendered resignation would be automatically   \neffective 30 days after the certification of  \nthe vote. We believe that our current         \npractices preserve the appropriate flexibility\nfor our Board to consider all relevant        \ncircumstances in the event a director fails to\nreceive majority support. The Board may find  \nit relevant, depending on the specific        \ncontext, to engage with stockholders to       \nunderstand the reasons for their vote and     \nwhether actions other than accepting the      \ndirector\u2019s resignation would better address   \nstockholder concerns, and also to consider    \nthat director\u2019s skills, qualifications,       \nexpertise, and contributions to our Board and \nCapital One and the consequences of the       \ndirector\u2019s departure from our Board within a  \nmonth after the election. Our existing process\npromotes stability and continuity and avoids  \nthe harm of a disruptive result that could    \ninterfere with the functions of our Board at  \npossibly critical times, while ensuring that  \nour Board takes seriously the views expressed \nby stockholders in the director\u2019s election.   \nOur existing stockholder engagement practices \nhelp provide accountability to our            \nstockholders. Our Investor Relations team     \nengages in regular stockholder outreach       \nthroughout the year, including comprehensive  \nengagement twice a year to gather feedback    \nfrom stockholders, including feedback on our  \ngovernance practices. This feedback from      \ninvestors is regularly shared with our Board  \nand its committees to ensure that our Board   \nhas insight on investors\u2019 views. *** The Board\nunanimously recommends that you vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Stockholder Proposal Requesting a Director\nElection Resignation Bylaw (Item 7 on Proxy   \nCard).                                        \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2024\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  138    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                 \n  OTHER MATTERS  \n                 \nSection XIV - Other Business Other Business As\nof the date of this proxy statement, we know  \nof no business that will be presented for     \nconsideration at the 2024 Annual Stockholder  \nMeeting other than the items referred to      \nabove.
