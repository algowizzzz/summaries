On October 11, 2019,\nwe completed the acquisition of the existing\nportfolio of Walmart\u2019s cobrand and private\nlabel credit card receivables, which added\napproximately $8.1 billion to our domestic\ncredit card loans held for investment\nportfolio as of the acquisition date.\n                                              \n  4    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)         \n  Pandemic                                    \n                                              \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global\npublic-health crisis, disrupting economies and\nintroducing significant volatility into\nfinancial markets and uncertainty as to when\neconomic and operating conditions will return\nto normalcy. This crisis continues to impact\nindividuals, households and businesses in a\nmultitude of ways. Companies in the U.S. and\nabroad have experienced unprecedented\ndisruptions to normal business operations,\nincluding customer-facing interactions, supply\nchains, office closures, changes in demand for\nproducts and services, and others. Financial\ninstitutions, including us, have been deemed\nan essential service and exempted from the\nmyriad of shutdowns across the country. We\ntransformed how we work in order to protect\nthe well-being of our associates and our\ncustomers, serve our customers, support our\ncommunities, and position ourselves to\nnavigate the challenges ahead.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a\nsignificant majority of our associates across\nour workforce have transitioned to working\nremotely, relying on our technology\ninfrastructure and systems that have been\ndesigned for resilience and security. The\nmajority of our associates will continue to\nwork remotely through at least the summer of\n2021, as we continue to prioritize their\nsafety while planning our return to the\noffice. We have been able to continue serving\ncustomers by successfully managing critical\nfunctions and keeping our lines of business\noperating. We implemented additional paid\nbenefits and flexible attendance policies that\nare intended to enable our associates to care\nfor their families and loved ones, including\nincreased pay for branch and Caf\u00e9 associates\nworking in open locations, associates that\nperform essential and time-sensitive banking\nactivities that cannot be performed remotely,\nand other U.S.-based associates in roles\ninstrumental to maintaining essential customer\nsupport. We continue to monitor and revise our\nsafety precautions and policies at banking\nlocations as government authorities continue\nto implement and modify measures to contain\nthe further spread of COVID-19. In our Retail\nBanking business, nearly all of our Caf\u00e9s and\nbranches across our network are open with\nincreased safety precautions. We will continue\nto monitor local conditions to ensure the\nsafety of our associates and customers while\nproviding critical banking services.\n\nWe have offered a range of policies and\nprograms to accommodate customer hardship\nacross our lines of business. In our Credit\nCard and Auto businesses, our customers, who\nwere in need and made a request, received\nforbearance primarily in the form of short-\nterm payment deferrals or extensions and fee\nwaivers. In our Retail Banking business, we\nwaived select fees for impacted customers and\noffered short-term payment deferrals for our\nsmall business banking customers. We have also\nbeen working with our Commercial Banking\ncustomers on a more customized basis. In\naddition, we have participated in the Paycheck\nProtection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), established by the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security\nAct (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) enacted in March 2020\nand implemented by the Small Business\nAdministration. See \u201cMD&A\u2014Credit Risk Profile\u201d\nfor more information about our customer\nassistance programs, including enrollment\nvolumes and outstandings, customer performance\nand current program offerings.\n\nWe reported net income of $2.7 billion ($5.18\nper diluted common share) for 2020, which\nreflects $5.0 billion in allowance builds in\nthe first and second quarters of 2020 due to\nexpectations of economic worsening as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic. These allowance\nbuilds, in combination with the adoption\nimpact of the Current Expected Credit Loss\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) standard, significantly increased our\nallowance coverage ratio to 6.19% as of\nDecember 31, 2020 from 2.71% as of December\n31, 2019. For more information, see\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Executive Summary and Business Outlook\u201d\nand \u201cMD&A\u2014Credit Risk Profile.\u201d We have\ncontinued to evaluate the potential impact on\nour goodwill impairment analysis and have\nincorporated recent market events and trends\ninto our valuations of instruments measured at\nfair value.

In\nour Domestic Card business, loan balances, and\nrevenue are down year-over-year, while\npurchase volume was relatively flat due to\nhigher first and fourth quarter activity\nsubstantially offsetting year-over-year volume\ndeclines in the second and third quarters. In\nour Auto business, we saw an increase in\norigination volumes and loan growth driven by\nour relationship strategy and digital\ncapabilities that we have developed. In our\nRetail Banking business, we have seen strong\ndeposit growth throughout the year from\nincreased consumer savings aided by the impact\nof government stimulus. In our Commercial\nBanking business, loan balances were\nrelatively flat year-over year, while deposit\nbalances were up significantly, reflecting the\nimpact of the economic environment and\ngovernment stimulus on our customers.\n\nWe are actively monitoring and responding to\ndevelopments across the myriad of landscapes\naffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nsocial, financial, legal, regulatory and\ngovernmental. As guidance is issued by\ngovernments and our regulators, we continue to\nassess the impacts on us. As government\nauthorities continue to implement, modify and\nreinstate social distancing and reopening\nplans and other measures to contain the\nfurther spread of COVID-19, including the\n                                              \n  5    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nadministration of vaccines, we will continue\nto adjust our business operations, policies\nand practices, keeping the best interests of\nour associates, customers and business\npartners at the forefront.\n                                              \n  Cybersecurity Incident                      \n                                              \nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nWe retained a leading independent\ncybersecurity firm that confirmed we correctly\nidentified and fixed the specific\nconfiguration vulnerability exploited in the\nCybersecurity Incident. We continue to invest\nsignificantly in cybersecurity and related\nrisk management activities and expect to make\nadditional investments as we continue to\nassess our cybersecurity program.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we\nincurred $66 million of incremental expenses\nrelated to the remediation of and response to\nthe Cybersecurity Incident, offset by $39\nmillion of insurance recoveries. To date, we\nhave incurred $138 million of incremental\nexpenses, offset by $73 million of insurance\nrecoveries pursuant to the cyber risk\ninsurance coverage we carry. These expenses\nmainly consist of customer notifications,\ncredit monitoring, technology costs, and\nprofessional and legal support. We expect any\nfurther expenses, net of insurance, to be\nimmaterial in future periods. We carry\ninsurance to cover certain costs associated\nwith a cyber risk event. This insurance has a\ntotal coverage limit of $400 million and is\nsubject to a $10 million deductible, which was\nmet in the third quarter of 2019, as well as\nstandard exclusions. The expenses discussed in\nthis paragraph do not include any amounts\nrelated to the matters described in \u201cNote\n18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and\nOthers.\u201d\n\nAlthough the ultimate magnitude and timing of\nexpenses or other impacts to our business or\nreputation related to the Cybersecurity\nIncident are uncertain, they may be\nsignificant, and some of the costs may not be\ncovered by insurance. However, we do not\nbelieve that this incident will materially\nimpact our strategy or our long-term financial\nhealth.

We also earn non-\ninterest income which primarily consists of\ninterchange income, net of reward expenses,\nservice charges and other customer-related\nfees. Our expenses primarily consist of the\nprovision for credit losses, operating\nexpenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customers served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at\nthe consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments,\nare included in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom.\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our customers typically include\ncompanies with annual revenues between $20\nmillion and $2 billion.\n\nCustomer usage and payment patterns, credit\nquality, levels of marketing expense and\noperating efficiency all affect our\nprofitability. In our Credit Card business, we\nexperience fluctuations in purchase volume and\nthe level of outstanding loan receivables due\nto seasonal variances in consumer spending and\npayment patterns which, for example, have\nhistorically been the highest around the\nwinter holiday season. Net charge-off rates\nfor our credit card loan portfolio also have\nhistorically exhibited seasonal patterns as\nwell and generally tend to be the highest in\nthe first quarter of the year.\n\nFor additional information on our business\nsegments, including the financial performance\nof each business, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n(\u201cMD&A\u201d)\u2014Executive Summary and Business\nOutlook,\u201d \u201cMD&A\u2014Business Segment Financial\nPerformance\u201d and \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d of\nthis Report.\n                                              \n  7    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n               \n  COMPETITION  \n               \nEach of our business segments operates in a\nhighly competitive environment, and we face\ncompetition in all aspects of our business\nfrom numerous bank and non-bank providers of\nfinancial services.\n\nOur Credit Card business competes with\ninternational, national, regional and local\nissuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards,\nas well as with American Express \u00ae , Discover\nCard \u00ae , private-label card brands, and, to a\ncertain extent, issuers of debit cards. In\ngeneral, customers are attracted to credit\ncard issuers largely on the basis of price,\ncredit limit, reward programs and other\nproduct features.\n\nOur Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses compete with national, state and\ndirect banks for deposits, commercial and auto\nloans, as well as with savings and loan\nassociations and credit unions for loans and\ndeposits. Our competitors also include\nautomotive finance companies, commercial\nmortgage banking companies and other financial\nservices providers that provide loans,\ndeposits, and other similar services and\nproducts. In addition, we compete against non-\ndepository institutions that are able to offer\nthese products and services.\n\nWe also consider new and emerging companies in\nthe digital and mobile payments space and\nother financial technology providers among our\ncompetitors. We compete with many forms of\npayment mechanisms, systems and products,\noffered by both bank and non-bank providers.\n\nOur businesses generally compete on the basis\nof the quality and range of their products and\nservices, transaction execution, innovation\nand price. Competition varies based on the\ntypes of clients, customers, industries and\ngeographies served. Our ability to compete\ndepends, in part, on our ability to attract\nand retain our associates and on our\nreputation as well as our ability to keep pace\nwith innovation, in particular in the\ndevelopment of new technology platforms. There\ncan be no assurance, however, that our ability\nto market products and services successfully\nor to obtain adequate returns on our products\nand services will not be impacted by the\nnature of the competition that now exists or\nmay later develop, or by the broader economic\nenvironment.

In\naddition to banking laws and regulations, we\nare subject to various other laws and\nregulations, all of which directly or\nindirectly affect our operations and\nmanagement and our ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. We and our\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators. In\naddition to laws and regulations, state and\nfederal bank regulatory agencies may issue\npolicy statements, interpretive letters and\nsimilar written guidance applicable to us and\nour subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes,\nregulations or regulatory policies applicable\nto us, including changes in their\ninterpretation or implementation, could have a\nmaterial effect on our business or\norganization.\n\nBoth the scope of the laws and regulations and\nthe intensity of the supervision to which we\nare subject have increased in recent years,\ninitially in response to the financial crisis,\nand more recently in light of other factors\nsuch as technological, political and market\nchanges. Regulatory enforcement and fines have\nalso increased across the banking and\nfinancial services sector.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant state and federal laws to which we\nare subject. The descriptions are qualified in\ntheir entirety by reference to the particular\nstatutory or regulatory provisions summarized.\nThey do not summarize all possible or proposed\nchanges in current laws or regulations and are\nnot intended to be a substitute for the\nrelated statues or regulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  Banking Regulation                          \n                                              \nCapital One Financial Corporation is a bank\nholding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d) under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHC Act\u201d),\nand is subject to the requirements of the BHC\nAct, including approval requirements for\ninvestments in or acquisitions of banking\norganizations, capital adequacy standards and\nlimitations on non-banking activities. As a\nBHC and FHC, we are subject to supervision,\nexamination and regulation by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System\n(\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). Permissible activities\nfor a BHC include those activities that are so\nclosely related to banking as to be a proper\nincident thereto. In addition, an FHC is\npermitted to engage in activities\n                                              \n  8    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nconsidered to be financial in nature\n(including, for example, securities\nunderwriting and dealing and merchant banking\nactivities), incidental to financial\nactivities or, if the Federal Reserve\ndetermines that they pose no risk to the\nsafety or soundness of depository institutions\nor the financial system in general, activities\ncomplementary to financial activities.\n\nTo become and remain eligible for FHC status,\na BHC and its subsidiary depository\ninstitutions must meet certain criteria,\nincluding capital, management and Community\nReinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. Failure\nto meet such criteria could result, depending\non which requirements were not met, in\nrestrictions on new financial activities or\nacquisitions or being required to discontinue\nexisting activities that are not generally\npermissible for BHCs.\n\nThe Banks are national associations chartered\nunder the National Bank Act, and the deposits\nof which are insured by the Deposit Insurance\nFund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) up to applicable limits.\nThe Banks are subject to comprehensive\nregulation and periodic examination by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(\u201cOCC\u201d), the FDIC and the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d).\n\nWe are also registered as a financial\ninstitution holding company under the laws of\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia and, as such, we\nare subject to periodic examination by the\nVirginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. We\nalso face regulation in the international\njurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nSee \u201cRegulation of Businesses by Authorities\nOutside the United States\u201d below for\nadditional details.\n                                              \n   Regulation of Business Activities          \n                                              \nThe business activities of the Company and the\nBanks are also subject to regulation and\nsupervision under various laws and\nregulations.\n                                              \n  Regulations of Consumer Lending Activities  \n                                              \nThe activities of the Banks as consumer\nlenders are subject to regulation under\nvarious federal laws, including, for example,\nthe Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit\nReporting Act, the CRA, the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of\n2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the Servicemembers\nCivil Relief Act and the Military Lending Act,\nas well as under various state laws. TILA, as\namended, imposes a number of restrictions on\ncredit card practices impacting rates and\nfees, requires that a consumer\u2019s ability to\npay be taken into account before issuing\ncredit or increasing credit limits, and\nimposes revised disclosures required for open-\nend credit.\n\nDepending on the underlying issue and\napplicable law, regulators may be authorized\nto impose penalties for violations of these\nstatutes and, in certain cases, to order banks\nto compensate customers. Borrowers may also\nhave a private right of action for certain\nviolations. Federal bankruptcy and state\ndebtor relief and collection laws may also\naffect the ability of a bank, including the\nBanks, to collect outstanding balances owed by\nborrowers.\n                                              \n  Debit Interchange Fees                      \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of\nany interchange fee received by a debit card\nissuer with respect to debit card transactions\nbe reasonable and proportional to the cost\nincurred by the issuer with respect to the\ntransaction. Rules adopted by the Federal\nReserve to implement these requirements limit\ninterchange fees per debit card transaction to\n$0.21 plus five basis points of the\ntransaction amount and provide for an\nadditional $0.01 fraud prevention adjustment\nto the interchange fee for issuers that meet\ncertain fraud prevention requirements.\n                                              \n  Privacy, Data Protection and Cybersecurity  \n                                              \nWe are subject to multiple federal and state\nlaws concerning privacy, data protection and\ncybersecurity, such as the Gramm-Leach Bliley\nAct (\u201cGLBA\u201d). This area has seen an increase\nin legislative and regulatory activity over\nthe past several years. For example, in 2018,\nthe State of California passed the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became\neffective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA and its\nimplementing regulations, as recently amended\nby the California Privacy Rights Act, create\nobligations on covered companies to, among\nother things, share certain information they\nhave collected about individuals who are\nCalifornia residents with those individuals,\nsubject to some exceptions.\n\nIn addition, in December 2020, the Federal\nReserve, OCC and FDIC (collectively, the\n\u201cFederal Banking Agencies\u201d) issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking that, among other things,\nwould require a banking organization to notify\nits primary federal regulators within 36 hours\nafter identifying a \"computer-security\nincident\" that the banking organization\nbelieves in good faith\n                                              \n  9    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ncould materially disrupt, degrade or impair\nits business or operations in a manner that\nwould, among other things, jeopardize the\nviability of its operations, result in\ncustomers being unable to access their deposit\nand other accounts, result in a material loss\nof revenue, profit or franchise value, or pose\na threat to the financial stability of the\nUnited States.\n\nWe continue to monitor data privacy and\ncybersecurity legal developments in the\njurisdictions in which we do business.

The AML Act also contains provisions\nthat promote increased information-sharing and\nuse of technology, and increases penalties for\nviolations of the Bank Secrecy Act and\nincludes whistleblower incentives, both of\nwhich could increase the prospect of\nregulatory enforcement.\n                                              \n  Funding                                     \n                                              \nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation Improvement Act of 1991\n(\u201cFDICIA\u201d), as discussed in \u201cMD&A\u2014Liquidity\nRisk Profile,\u201d only well capitalized and\nadequately capitalized institutions may accept\nbrokered deposits. Adequately capitalized\ninstitutions, however, must obtain a waiver\nfrom the FDIC before accepting brokered\ndeposits, and such institutions may not pay\nrates that significantly exceed the rates paid\non deposits of similar maturity obtained from\nthe institution\u2019s normal market area or, for\ndeposits obtained from outside the\ninstitution\u2019s normal market area, the national\nrate on deposits of comparable maturity. In\nDecember 2020, the FDIC finalized amendments\nto the brokered deposit regulation that, among\nother things, generally clarify and narrow the\nscope of the \"deposit broker\" definition. The\namendments become effective April 1, 2021.\n\nThe FDIC is authorized to terminate a bank\u2019s\ndeposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC\nthat the bank\u2019s financial condition is unsafe\nor unsound or that the institution has engaged\nin unsafe or unsound practices or has violated\nany applicable rule, regulation, order or\ncondition enacted or imposed by the bank\u2019s\nregulatory agency.\n                                              \n  Broker-Dealer and Investment Advisory       \n  Activities                                  \n                                              \nCertain of our non-bank subsidiaries are\nsubject to regulation and supervision by\nvarious federal and state authorities. United\nIncome, Inc. is an investment adviser\nregistered with the SEC and primarily\nregulated under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940. Capital One Securities, Inc. and\nKippsDeSanto & Company are registered broker-\ndealers regulated by the SEC and the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority. These broker-\ndealer subsidiaries are subject, among other\nthings, to net capital rules designed to\nmeasure the general financial condition and\nliquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these\nrules, broker-dealers are required to maintain\nthe minimum net capital deemed necessary to\nmeet their continuing commitments to customers\nand others, and to keep a substantial portion\nof their assets in relatively liquid form.\nThese rules also limit the ability of a\nbroker-dealer to\n                                              \n  10    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ntransfer capital to its parent companies and\nother affiliates.

CONA\nprovisionally registered with the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) as a\nswap dealer in the third quarter of 2020.\nRegistration as a swap dealer subjects CONA to\nadditional regulatory requirements with\nrespect to its swaps and other derivatives\nactivities. As a result of CONA\u2019s swap dealer\nregistration, it is subject to the rules of\nthe OCC concerning capital and margin\nrequirements for swap dealers, including the\nmandatory exchange of variation margin and\ninitial margin with certain counterparties.\nAdditionally, as a provisionally registered\nswap dealer, CONA is subject to requirements\nunder the CFTC\u2019s regulatory regime, including\nrules regarding business conduct standards,\nrecordkeeping obligations, regulatory\nreporting and procedures relating to swaps\ntrading.

The Basel III\nCapital Rules implement certain capital and\nliquidity requirements published by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel\nCommittee\u201d), along with certain Dodd-Frank Act\nand other capital provisions. Under the Basel\nIII Capital Rules, we must maintain a minimum\ncommon equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of\n4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a\ntotal capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in\nrelation to risk-weighted assets. In addition,\nwe must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of\n4% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio\nof 3%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer and countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirements, as described\nbelow.\n\nIn July 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies\nfinalized certain changes to the Basel III\nCapital Rules for institutions not subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches (\u201cCapital\nSimplification Rule\u201d). These changes,\neffective January 1, 2020, generally raised\nthe threshold above which a covered\ninstitution such as the Company must deduct\ncertain assets from its CET1 capital,\nincluding certain deferred tax assets,\nmortgage servicing assets, and investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions.\n\nIn October 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies\namended the Basel III Capital Rules to provide\nfor tailored application of certain capital\nrequirements across different categories of\nbanking institutions (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d).\nThese categories are determined primarily by\nan institution\u2019s asset size, with adjustments\nto a more stringent category possible if the\ninstitution exceeds certain risk-based\nthresholds. As a BHC with total consolidated\nassets of at least $250 billion that does not\nexceed any\n                                              \n  11    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nof the applicable risk-based thresholds, we\nare a Category III institution under the\nTailoring Rules. Therefore, effective January\n1, 2020, we were no longer subject to the\nBasel III \u201cAdvanced Approaches\u201d framework and\ncertain associated capital requirements, such\nas the requirement to include certain elements\nof accumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) in our regulatory capital. We remain\nsubject to the countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement (which is currently set at 0%) and\nsupplementary leverage ratio requirement,\nwhich were previously required only for Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches institutions.\nEffective as of the first quarter of 2020, we\nexcluded certain elements of AOCI from our\nregulatory capital as permitted by the\nTailoring Rules. The Tailoring Rules and\nCapital Simplification Rule have, taken\ntogether, decreased our capital requirements.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement (\u201cG-SIB\nSurcharge\u201d). We are not a G-SIB based on the\nmost recent available data and thus we are not\nsubject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules also require\nbanking institutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. The\ncapital conservation buffer for BHCs was\npreviously fixed at 2.5%. In March 2020, the\nFederal Reserve issued a final rule to\nimplement the stress capital buffer\nrequirement (\u201cStress Capital Buffer Rule\u201d).\nThe stress capital buffer requirement is\ninstitution-specific and replaces the fixed\n2.5% capital conservation buffer for BHCs.\n\nPursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule,\nthe Federal Reserve will use the results of\nits supervisory stress test to determine the\nsize of a BHC\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement. In particular, a BHC\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement will equal, subject\nto a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the\ndifference between the BHC\u2019s starting CET1\ncapital ratio and its lowest projected CET1\ncapital ratio under the severely adverse\nscenario of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory\nstress test plus (ii) the ratio of the BHC\u2019s\nprojected four quarters of common stock\ndividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters\nof the planning horizon) to the projected\nrisk-weighted assets for the quarter in which\nthe BHC\u2019s projected CET1 capital ratio reaches\nits minimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nUnder the Stress Capital Buffer Rule\nframework, the Company\u2019s new \u201cstandardized\napproach capital conservation buffer\u201d includes\nits stress capital buffer requirement (which\nwill be recalibrated every year based on the\nCompany\u2019s supervisory stress test results),\nany G-SIB surcharge (which is not applicable\nto us) and the countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement (which is currently set at 0%).\nAny determination to increase the\ncountercyclical capital buffer generally would\nbe effective twelve months after the\nannouncement of such an increase, unless the\nFederal Banking Agencies set an earlier\neffective date.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Banks. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\n\nIf we fail to maintain our capital ratios\nabove the minimum capital requirements plus\nthe applicable buffer requirements, we will\nface increasingly strict automatic limitations\non capital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, if a\nbanking institution\u2019s capital ratios fall\nwithin its buffer requirements, the maximum\namount of capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments it can make is a\nfunction of its eligible retained income. In\nMarch 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies\nrevised the definition of \u201celigible retained\nincome\u201d in their respective capital rules.\nUnder the revised definition of \u201celigible\nretained income,\u201d any such automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions would\napply in a less severe and more gradual manner\nthan would otherwise have occurred under the\nprevious definition of that term. This change\nwas made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nto support banking organizations that choose\nto use their capital and liquidity buffers to\nlend and undertake other actions that support\neconomic activity in a safe and sound manner.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Rule                                        \n                                              \nAs part of the response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted\na final rule (\u201c2020 CECL Transition Rule\u201d)\nthat provides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the CECL standard on their\nregulatory capital (the \u201c2020 CECL Transition\nElection\u201d).\n\nPursuant to the 2020 CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution may elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies use a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard\n                                              \n  12    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ncompared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions are permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. Beginning January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year.

These exclusions became\neffective on April 1, 2020, and will remain in\neffect through March 31, 2021.\n\nSubsequently, in May 2020, the Federal Banking\nAgencies issued an interim final rule that\nprovides an option for depository institutions\nto make similar exclusions to the calculation\nof the supplementary leverage ratio. If a\ndepository institution elects to make such\nexclusions, it must request prior approval\nfrom its primary federal banking regulator\nbefore making capital distributions, such as\npaying dividends to its parent company, for as\nlong as the exclusions are in effect. Neither\nCONA nor COBNA elected to make such\nexclusions.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust\ntheir risk-based capital ratios to reflect the\nmarket risk in their trading portfolios. The\nMarket Risk Rule generally applies to\ninstitutions with aggregate trading assets and\nliabilities equal to the lesser of 10% or more\nof total assets or $1 billion or more. The\nCompany and CONA are subject to the Market\nRisk Rule. See \u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d\nbelow for additional information.\n                                              \n  FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action         \n                                              \nThe FDICIA requires the Federal Banking\nAgencies to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d\nfor banks that do not meet minimum capital\nrequirements. The FDICIA establishes five\ncapital ratio levels: well capitalized;\nadequately capitalized; undercapitalized;\nsignificantly undercapitalized; and critically\nundercapitalized. The three undercapitalized\ncategories are based upon the amount by which\na bank falls below the ratios applicable to an\nadequately capitalized institution. The\ncapital categories relate to the FDICIA\u2019s\nprompt corrective action (\u201cPCA\u201d) provisions,\nand such capital categories may not constitute\nan accurate representation of the Banks\u2019\noverall financial condition or prospects.\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules updated the PCA\nframework to reflect new, higher regulatory\ncapital minimums. For an insured depository\ninstitution to be well capitalized, it must\nmaintain a total risk-based capital ratio of\n10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or\nmore; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more;\nand a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An\nadequately capitalized depository institution\nmust maintain a total risk-based capital ratio\nof 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or\nmore; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a\nleverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for\nCategory III and certain other institutions\nunder the Tailoring Rules, a supplementary\nleverage ratio of 3% or more. The PCA\nprovisions also authorize the Federal Banking\nAgencies to reclassify a bank\u2019s capital\ncategory or take other action against banks\nthat are determined to be in an unsafe or\nunsound condition or to have engaged in unsafe\nor unsound banking practices.\n                                              \n  13    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAs an additional means to identify problems in\nthe financial management of depository\ninstitutions, the FDICIA required the Federal\nBanking Agencies to establish certain non-\ncapital safety and soundness standards. The\nstandards adopted by the Federal Banking\nAgencies relate generally to operations and\nmanagement, asset quality, interest rate\nexposure and executive compensation. The\nFederal Banking Agencies are authorized to\ntake action against institutions that fail to\nmeet such standards.\n                                              \n   Basel III and United States Liquidity      \n   Rules                                      \n                                              \nThe Basel Committee has published a liquidity\nframework that includes two standards for\nliquidity risk supervision. One standard, the\nliquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), seeks to\npromote short-term resilience by requiring\norganizations to hold sufficient high-quality\nliquid assets (\u201cHQLAs\u201d) to survive a stress\nscenario lasting for 30 days. The other\nstandard, the net stable funding ratio\n(\u201cNSFR\u201d), seeks to promote longer-term\nresilience by requiring sufficient stable\nfunding over a one-year period based on the\nliquidity characteristics of the\norganization\u2019s assets and activities.\n\nThe Company and the Banks are subject to the\nLCR standard as implemented by the Federal\nReserve and OCC (the \u201cLCR Rule\u201d). The LCR Rule\nrequires the Company and each of the Banks to\nhold an amount of eligible HQLA that equals or\nexceeds 100% of its respective projected\nadjusted net cash outflows over a 30-day\nperiod, each as calculated in accordance with\nthe LCR Rule. The LCR Rule requires us to\ncalculate our LCR daily. In addition, the\nCompany is required to make quarterly public\ndisclosures of its LCR and certain related\nquantitative liquidity metrics, along with a\nqualitative discussion of its LCR.\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, as a Category III\ninstitution with less than $75 billion in\nweighted average short-term wholesale funding,\nthe Company\u2019s and the Banks\u2019 total net cash\noutflows are multiplied by an outflow\nadjustment percentage of 85%. Although the\nBanks may hold more HQLA than they need to\nmeet their LCR requirements, the LCR Rule\nrestricts the amount of such excess HQLA held\nat the Banks (referred to as \u201cTrapped\nLiquidity\u201d) that can be included in the\nCompany\u2019s HQLA amount. Because we typically\nmanage the Banks\u2019 LCRs to levels well above\n100%, the amount of Trapped Liquidity will\nalso increase as the Banks\u2019 total net cash\noutflows are reduced by the outflow adjustment\npercentage of 85%.\n\nIn October 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies\nfinalized a rule to implement the NSFR in the\nUnited States (the \u201cNSFR Rule\u201d). The NSFR Rule\nrequires the Company and each of the Banks to\nmaintain an amount of available stable\nfunding, which is a weighted measure of a\ncompany\u2019s funding sources over a one-year time\nhorizon, calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to equity and liabilities based on\ntheir expected stability, that is no less than\nthe amount of required stable funding, which\nis calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to assets, derivatives exposures\nand certain other items based on their\nliquidity characteristics. As a Category III\ninstitution, the Company and the Banks are\nsubject to an NSFR requirement equal to 85% of\nthe full NSFR requirement. The NSFR Rule will\nbecome effective as of July 1, 2021 and will\napply to the Company and each of the Banks.\nThe NSFR Rule includes a semi-annual\ndisclosure requirement, with the first public\ndisclosure required after June 30, 2023.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Other\nRelated Requirements\nWe are subject to certain enhanced prudential\nstandards under the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended\nby the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and\nConsumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d) and\nimplemented by various regulations issued by\nthe Federal Banking Agencies. The Financial\nStability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) may also\nissue recommendations to the Federal Reserve\nor other primary financial regulatory agencies\nto apply new or enhanced standards to certain\nfinancial activities or practices.\n\nAs part of the enhanced prudential standards,\nthe Company is required to implement\nresolution planning for orderly resolution in\nthe event it faces material financial distress\nor failure. The FDIC issued similar rules\nregarding resolution planning applicable to\nthe Banks. In addition, the OCC has issued\nrules requiring banks with assets of $250\nbillion or more to develop recovery plans\ndetailing the actions they would take to\nremain a going concern when they experience\nconsiderable financial or operational stress,\nbut have not deteriorated to the point that\nresolution is imminent.\n\nThe enhanced prudential standards also include\nsupervisory and company-run stress testing\nrequirements (also known as the \u201cDFAST stress\ntesting requirements\u201d). In particular, the\nFederal Reserve is required to conduct annual\nstress tests on certain covered companies,\nincluding us, to ensure that the covered\ncompanies have sufficient capital to absorb\nlosses and continue operations during adverse\neconomic conditions. Under the stress capital\nbuffer framework, the result of our\nsupervisory stress test will be used to\ndetermine our stress capital buffer\nrequirement. As a covered company that is a\nCategory III institution under the Tailoring\nRules, we are also required to conduct our own\nstress tests and publish the results of such\ntests on our website or other public forum.\nThe Company must disclose the results of its\ncompany-run stress test on a biennial basis.\nThe\n                                              \n  14    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nOCC has adopted a similar stress test rule\nrequiring banks with at least $250 billion in\nassets, including CONA, to conduct their own\ncompany-run stress tests. Under that OCC rule,\nCONA must also disclose the results of its\nstress test on a biennial basis.\n\nIn addition, the Company is required to meet\nliquidity risk management standards, conduct\ninternal liquidity stress tests, and maintain\na 30-day buffer of highly liquid assets, in\neach case, consistent with the requirements of\nthe enhanced prudential standards. These\nrequirements are in addition to the LCR and\nNSFR Rules, discussed above in \u201cBasel III and\nUnited States Liquidity Rules.\u201d The enhanced\nprudential standards also require that the\nCompany comply with, and hold capital\ncommensurate with, the requirements of, any\nregulations adopted by the Federal Reserve\nrelating to capital planning and stress tests.\nStress testing and capital planning\nregulations are discussed further below under\n\u201cDividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of\nFunds.\u201d Finally, the Company is also required\nto establish and maintain an enterprise-wide\nrisk management framework that includes a risk\ncommittee and a chief risk officer.\n\nAlthough not a requirement of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, the OCC established regulatory guidelines\n(\u201cHeightened Standards Guidelines\u201d) that apply\nheightened standards to the governance and\nrisk management practices of large\ninstitutions subject to its supervision,\nincluding the Banks. The Heightened Standards\nGuidelines establish standards for the\ndevelopment and implementation by the Banks of\na risk governance framework.\nDividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of\nFunds\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital planning\nrules (commonly referred to as Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and Review or \u201cCCAR\u201d\nrequirements), a \u201ccovered BHC,\u201d such as the\nCompany, must submit a capital plan to the\nFederal Reserve on an annual basis that\ncontains a description of all planned capital\nactions, including dividends or stock\nrepurchases, over a nine-quarter planning\nhorizon beginning with the first quarter of\nthe calendar year the capital plan is\nsubmitted (\u201cCCAR cycle\u201d).\n\nThe DFAST stress testing requirements,\ndescribed above in \u201cEnhanced Prudential\nStandards and Other Related Requirements,\u201d is\na complementary exercise to CCAR. It is a\nforward-looking exercise conducted by the\nFederal Reserve and each covered company to\nhelp assess whether a company has sufficient\ncapital to absorb losses and continue\noperations during adverse economic conditions.\n\nPursuant to the CCAR requirements, the Company\nmust file its capital plan and stress testing\nresults with the Federal Reserve by April 5 of\neach year (unless the Federal Reserve\ndesignates a later date), using data as of the\nend of the prior calendar year. The Federal\nReserve will conduct its supervisory stress\ntest in the second quarter and determine the\nCompany\u2019s stress capital buffer by June 30 of\nthat year. The Company will have two business\ndays from receipt of its stress capital buffer\nto make any necessary adjustments to its\nplanned capital distributions. The Federal\nReserve will then finalize the stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the Company based on\nits adjusted planned capital distributions and\nconfirm the Company\u2019s planned capital\ndistributions by August 31 of that year. The\nCompany\u2019s final stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be effective from the fourth\nquarter of the year the capital plan is\nsubmitted through the third quarter of the\nfollowing year. The Company may make the\nplanned capital distributions confirmed by the\nFederal Reserve. In addition, under the Stress\nCapital Buffer Rule, the Company is no longer\nrequired to seek prior approval of the Federal\nReserve to make capital distributions in\nexcess of those included in its capital plan\nso long as the Company is otherwise in\ncompliance with the capital rule\u2019s automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions.\n\nIn December 2018, the Federal Reserve\nannounced that it would maintain its pre-CECL\nframework for calculating allowances on loans\nin the supervisory stress test for the 2020\nand 2021 cycles until the impact of CECL is\nbetter known and understood. The Federal\nReserve stated further that, although BHCs\nrequired to perform company-run stress tests\nwill be required to incorporate CECL into\nthose stress tests starting in the 2020 cycle,\nit will not issue supervisory findings on\nthose BHCs\u2019 allowance estimations in the CCAR\nexercise through 2021.\n\nHistorically, dividends from the Company\u2019s\ndirect and indirect subsidiaries have\nrepresented a major source of the funds we\nhave used to pay dividends on our capital\nstock, make payments on our corporate debt\nsecurities and meet our other obligations.\nThere are various federal law limitations on\nthe extent to which the Banks can finance or\notherwise supply funds to the Company through\ndividends and loans. These limitations include\nminimum regulatory capital requirements,\nfederal banking law requirements concerning\nthe payment of dividends out of net profits or\nsurplus, provisions of Sections 23A and 23B of\nthe Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W\ngoverning transactions between an insured\ndepository institution and its affiliates, as\nwell as general federal regulatory oversight\nto prevent unsafe or unsound practices. In\ngeneral, federal and applicable state banking\nlaws prohibit insured depository institutions,\nsuch as the Banks, from making dividend\ndistributions without first\n                                              \n  15    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nobtaining regulatory approval if such\ndistributions are not paid out of available\nearnings or would cause the institution to\nfail to meet applicable capital adequacy\nstandards.\n\nIn June 2020, in light of the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Reserve required all\nCCAR participating BHCs, including us, to\nupdate and resubmit their capital plans in the\nfourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the\nFederal Reserve required all participating\nBHCs, including us, to preserve capital by\nsuspending share repurchases and capping\ncommon stock dividend payments for the third\nand fourth quarters of 2020 to the lower of\n(i) the amount paid in the second quarter of\n2020 and (ii) an amount equal to the average\nnet income earned across the four preceding\ncalendar quarters. Scheduled payments on\nadditional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital\ninstruments, such as preferred stock and\nsubordinated debt, were not similarly\nrestricted.\n\nWe conducted a second round of stress tests\nand submitted our updated capital plan to the\nFederal Reserve on November 2, 2020. On\nDecember 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nreleased the results of its second round of\nsupervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve\ndid not recalculate our stress capital buffer\nrequirement at that time, but reserved its\nability to do so until March 31, 2021.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve extended the\ncapital distribution restrictions for all\nparticipating BHCs through at least the first\nquarter of 2021, with certain modifications.\nIn particular, for the first quarter of 2021,\nparticipating BHCs may resume share\nrepurchases, but the aggregate amount of\ncommon stock dividend payments and share\nrepurchases shall not exceed an amount equal\nto the average net income earned across the\nfour preceding calendar quarters. In addition,\ncommon stock dividend payments for the first\nquarter of 2021 continue to be capped at the\namount paid in the second quarter of 2020.\n                                              \n  Investment in the Company and the Banks     \n                                              \nCertain acquisitions of our capital stock may\nbe subject to regulatory approval or notice\nunder federal or state law. Investors are\nresponsible for ensuring that they do not,\ndirectly or indirectly, acquire shares of our\ncapital stock in excess of the amount that can\nbe acquired without regulatory approval,\nincluding under the BHC Act and the Change in\nBank Control Act (\u201cCIBC Act\u201d).\n\nFederal law and regulations prohibit any\nperson or company from acquiring control of\nthe Company or the Banks without, in most\ncases, prior written approval of the Federal\nReserve or the OCC, as applicable. Control\nunder the BHC Act exists if, among other\nthings, a person or company acquires more than\n25% of any class of our voting stock or\notherwise has a controlling influence over us.\nA rebuttable presumption of control arises\nunder the CIBC Act for a publicly traded BHC\nsuch as ourselves if a person or company\nacquires more than 10% of any class of our\nvoting stock.\n\nAdditionally, COBNA and CONA are \u201cbanks\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 6.1\nof the Code of Virginia governing the\nacquisition of interests in Virginia financial\ninstitutions (\u201cFinancial Institution Holding\nCompany Act\u201d). The Financial Institution\nHolding Company Act prohibits any person or\nentity from acquiring, or making any public\noffer to acquire, control of a Virginia\nfinancial institution or its holding company\nwithout making application to, and receiving\nprior approval from, the Virginia Bureau of\nFinancial Institutions.\n                                              \n  Deposit Insurance Assessments               \n                                              \nEach of CONA and COBNA, as an insured\ndepository institution, is a member of the DIF\nmaintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the\nFDIC insures the deposits of insured\ndepository institutions up to prescribed\nlimits for each depositor. The FDIC sets a\nDesignated Reserve Ratio (\u201cDRR\u201d) for the DIF.\nTo maintain the DIF, member institutions may\nbe assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC\nmay take action to increase insurance premiums\nif the DRR falls below its required level.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio\nfell to 1.30 percent. The FDIC, as required\nunder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\nestablished a plan in September 2020, to\nrestore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or\nexceed 1.35 percent within eight years. The\nFDIC\u2019s restoration plan projects the reserve\nratio to exceed 1.35 percent without\nincreasing the deposit insurance assessment\nrate, subject to ongoing monitoring over the\nnext eight years.\nSource of Strength and Liability for Commonly\nControlled Institutions\nUnder regulations issued by the Federal\nReserve, a BHC must serve as a source of\nfinancial and managerial strength to its\nsubsidiary banks (the so-called \u201csource of\nstrength doctrine\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Act\ncodified this doctrine.\n\nUnder the \u201ccross-guarantee\u201d provision of the\nFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery and\nEnforcement Act of 1989 (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), insured\ndepository institutions such as the Banks may\nbe liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss\nincurred, or reasonably anticipated to be\nincurred, by the FDIC in connection with the\ndefault of, or FDIC assistance to, any\ncommonly\n                                              \n  16    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ncontrolled insured depository institution. The\nBanks are commonly controlled within the\nmeaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee\nprovision.\n                                              \n  FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority          \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with\nliquidation authority that may be used to\nliquidate non-bank financial companies and\nBHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in\nconsultation with the President and based on\nthe recommendation of the Federal Reserve and\nother appropriate Federal Banking Agencies,\ndetermines that doing so is necessary, among\nother criteria, to mitigate serious adverse\neffects on U.S. financial stability. Upon such\na determination, the FDIC would be appointed\nreceiver and must liquidate the company in a\nway that mitigates significant risks to\nfinancial stability and minimizes moral\nhazard. The costs of a liquidation of the\ncompany would be borne by shareholders and\nunsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by\nrisk-based assessments on large financial\ncompanies. The FDIC has issued rules\nimplementing certain provisions of its\nliquidation authority and may issue additional\nrules in the future.\n                                              \n  COVID-19 Activities                         \n                                              \nIn response to disruptions in economic\nconditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,\nfederal and state governments and agencies and\ngovernment\u2011sponsored enterprises have taken a\nvariety of actions to support people and\nentities affected by the pandemic, including\nthe passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,\nand Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) in\nMarch 2020. The CARES Act, among other\nprovisions, authorized a number of lending\nprograms to support the flow of credit to\nconsumers and businesses. For example, the\nCARES Act established several programs with\nthe Small Business Administration, including\nthe PPP, to provide loans to small businesses.\n\nThe Federal Reserve had also taken\nextraordinary efforts in response to the\npandemic, including, among other actions, the\nestablishment of a Main Street Lending Program\nthat is intended to support lending to\neligible small and midsize businesses. The\nFederal Banking Agencies had also encouraged\nbanking organizations to take certain\nadditional actions to support the financial\nservices needs of their customers in a prudent\nand safe and sound manner, including through\nloan modifications. Further, banking\norganizations had been provided with certain\naccounting, supervisory and regulatory relief\nduring this period, including relief that is\nintended to allow banking organizations to\nenter into loan modifications without certain\naccounting and regulatory capital\nconsequences. For example, the CARES Act gave\nbanking organizations an option to temporarily\nsuspend the determination of certain qualified\nloans modified as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic as being troubled debt restructurings\n(\u201cTDRs\u201d). See \u201cMD&A\u2014Credit Risk\nProfile\u2014COVID-19 Customer Assistance Programs\nand Loan Modifications\u201d for additional\ninformation. The CARES Act also amended the\nFair Credit Reporting Act to impose new,\ntemporary reporting requirements on furnishers\nof information to consumer reporting agencies\nrelated to accounts of consumers in payment\naccommodation programs in light of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,\nwhich was enacted in December 2020, extends\ncertain relief provided by the CARES Act while\nalso modifying or clarifying certain other\nprovisions. Among other amendments to the\nCARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations\nAct, 2021, extends the relief related to TDRs\nuntil January 1, 2022 and the PPP until March\n31, 2021.

We recruit\nthrough a variety of channels, including\nprofessional partnerships, job fairs, online\nplatforms, on-campus recruiting, diversity-\nrelated recruiting events and initiatives, and\ninternship and rotational programs, among\nothers. We empower our associates to learn new\nskills, meet personalized development goals,\nand grow their careers.

Our internal\nenterprise learning and development team\nblends multiple approaches to learning to\nsupport associate development across lines of\nbusiness, levels, and roles, including online\nand live classroom training. In addition to\nformal programming provided by learning\nprofessionals, including regulatory\ncompliance, role-specific topics and others,\nour peer-to-peer learning strategy empowers\nassociates to be both learners and teachers,\nfurther enhancing a culture of learning. We\nalso focus on cultivating talent with\nleadership development courses, cohort-based\nprograms, network building, and coaching.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we review our ability to\nattract and retain talent needed to deliver on\nour strategic business objectives. Each line\nof business and staff group reviews hiring,\ntenure and attrition metrics as part of this\nassessment, and they implement mitigation\nplans when needed.\n                                              \n  Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging          \n                                              \nWe continuously strive to empower our\nassociates to do great work by creating an\ninclusive workplace and a culture of belonging\nthat values diverse perspectives, fosters\ncollaboration and encourages innovative ideas.\nWe aim to create a place where associates of\nall backgrounds can thrive by bringing their\nbest, most authentic selves to work.

Central to this effort are our\nbusiness resource groups, associate-led\norganizations which deepen our understanding\nof different cultures, people and experiences,\nand enable associates to build connections,\ninvest in their professional development, and\nsupport our commitment to attract, develop and\nretain a diverse workforce. In addition, our\nChief Executive Officer and the Executive\nCommittee engage with leaders of our business\nresource groups to identify opportunities to\nfurther our DIB agenda, enact positive change\nand build on existing initiatives designed to\nnurture our culture and workplace environment.\n\nGrowing the diversity of our workforce at all\nlevels, with an emphasis on leader and\nexecutive roles, is an important component of\nour comprehensive DIB strategy.

Furthermore,\npay equity has long been a core tenet of our\npay philosophy and is central to our values.\nWe annually evaluate base pay and incentive\npay for all of our associates globally. This\nreview and evaluation may occur more\nfrequently as deemed necessary and prudent. We\nreview groups of associates in similar roles,\nadjusting for factors that appropriately\nexplain differences in pay such as job\nlocation and experience. Based on our\nanalysis, our aggregated adjusted pay gap\nresults show that we pay women 100% of what\nmen are paid, and we pay racial and ethnic\nminorities in the U.S. 100% of what non-\nminorities are paid. We use statistical\nmodeling to understand what drives pay gaps,\ninstill new practices to eliminate them in the\nfuture, and if we find unexplained pay gaps,\nwe close them.\n\nIn 2020, a significant majority of our\nassociates across our workforce have\ntransitioned to working remotely as we\nprioritize the safety of our associates during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.

The events\nand consequences discussed in these risk\nfactors could, in circumstances we may not be\nable to accurately predict, recognize, or\ncontrol, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, growth, reputation, prospects,\nfinancial condition, operating results, cash\nflows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk\nfactors do not identify all risks that we\nface; our operations could also be affected by\nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not\npresently known to us or that we currently do\nnot consider to present significant risks to\nour operations. In addition, the global\neconomic and political climate may amplify\nmany of these risks.\n                                              \n  Summary of Risk Factors                     \n                                              \nBelow is a summary of the principal factors\nthat make an investment in our securities\nrisky. This summary does not address all of\nthe risks that we face. Additional discussion\nof the risks summarized in this risk factor\nsummary, and other risks that we face, can be\nfound below and should be carefully\nconsidered, together with other information in\nthis Form 10-K and our other filings with the\nSEC, before making an investment decision\nregarding our common stock.\n\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted\nour business and financial results, and the\nextent to which the pandemic and measures\ntaken in response to the pandemic could\nmaterially and adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition, liquidity, capital and\nresults of operations will depend on future\ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and\nare difficult to predict.\n\n\u2022 Changes and instability in the macroeconomic\nenvironment, consumer confidence and customer\nbehavior may adversely affect our business.\n\n\u2022 Financial market instability and volatility\ncould adversely affect our business.\n\n\u2022 We may experience increased delinquencies,\ncredit losses, inaccurate estimates and\ninadequate reserves.\n\n\u2022 We may not be able to maintain adequate\ncapital or liquidity levels, which could have\na negative impact on our financial results and\nour ability to return capital to our\nstockholders.\n\u2022 We face risks related to our operational,\ntechnological and organizational\ninfrastructure.\n                                              \n  23    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Theft, loss or misuse of information as a\nresult of a cyber-attack may result in\nincreased costs, reductions in revenue,\nreputational damage and business disruptions.\n\n\u2022 Potential data protection and privacy\nincidents, and our required compliance with\nregulations related to these areas, may\nincrease our costs, reduce our revenue and\nlimit our ability to pursue business\nopportunities.\n\n\u2022 Compliance with new and existing laws,\nregulations and regulatory expectations is\ncostly and complex.\n\u2022 Our businesses are subject to the risk of\nincreased litigation, government\ninvestigations and regulatory enforcement.\n\n\u2022 We face intense competition in all of our\nmarkets.\n\n\u2022 Our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations may be adversely\naffected by merchants\u2019 increasing focus on the\nfees charged by credit card networks and by\nlegislation and regulation impacting such\nfees.\n\u2022 If we are not able to invest successfully in\nand introduce digital and other technological\ndevelopments across all our businesses, our\nfinancial performance may suffer.\n\u2022 We may fail to realize all of the\nanticipated benefits of our mergers,\nacquisitions and strategic partnerships.\n\n\u2022 Reputational risk and social factors may\nimpact our results and damage our brand.\n\n\u2022 If we are not able to protect our\nintellectual property, our revenue and\nprofitability could be negatively affected.\n\u2022 Our risk management strategies may not be\nfully effective in mitigating our risk\nexposures in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk.\n\n\u2022 Fluctuations in market interest rates or\nvolatility in the capital markets could\nadversely affect our income and expense, the\nvalue of assets and obligations, our\nregulatory capital, cost of capital or\nliquidity.\n\n\u2022 Uncertainty regarding, and transition away\nfrom, LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022 Our business could be negatively affected if\nwe are unable to attract, retain and motivate\nskilled employees.\n\n\u2022 We face risks from unpredictable\ncatastrophic events.\n\n\u2022 We face risks from the use of or changes to\nassumptions or estimates in our financial\nstatements.\n\u2022 Limitations on our ability to receive\ndividends from our subsidiaries could affect\nour liquidity and ability to pay dividends and\nrepurchase common stock.\n\u2022 The soundness of other financial\ninstitutions and other third parties could\nadversely affect us.\n                                              \n  General Economic and Market Risks           \n                                              \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted\nour business and financial results, and the\nextent to which the pandemic and measures\ntaken in response to the pandemic could\nmaterially and adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition, liquidity, capital and\nresults of operations will depend on future\ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and\nare difficult to predict.\n\nGlobal health concerns relating to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and related government\nactions taken to reduce the spread of the\nvirus have impacted the macroeconomic\nenvironment, significantly increased economic\nuncertainty and reduced economic activity. The\npandemic has also caused governmental\nauthorities to implement numerous measures to\ntry to contain the virus, including travel\nbans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-\nin-place orders, and business limitations and\nshutdowns. These measures have negatively\nimpacted and may further negatively impact\nconsumer and business payment and spending\npatterns.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted,\nand may continue to adversely impact, our\nbusiness, operations, financial condition,\ncapital and results of operations. The extent\nof these impacts depends on future\ndevelopments, which are highly uncertain and\ndifficult to predict, including, but not\nlimited to, the duration and magnitude of the\npandemic, the actions taken to contain the\nvirus or treat its impact, the effectiveness\nof economic stimulus measures in the United\nStates, and how quickly and\n                                              \n  24    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nto what extent economic and operating\nconditions and consumer and business spending\ncan return to their pre-pandemic levels. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, several vaccines have been\nauthorized for limited distribution. The plan\nfor larger community-based distribution is\nbeing developed and may begin during the\nsecond quarter of 2021. However, the timing\nand extent of any such widespread distribution\nof vaccines remains uncertain. As a result of\nthis uncertainty, our purchase volume, loan\ngrowth and the overall demand for our products\nand services may be significantly impacted,\nwhich could adversely affect our revenue and\nother results of operations. In addition, we\ncould experience higher credit losses in our\nloan portfolios and increases in our allowance\nfor credit losses beyond current levels. For\nexample, as a result of the significant\nuncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we\nrealized a substantial build in our allowance\nfor credit losses for the first two quarters\nof 2020. We could also experience impairments\nof other financial assets and other negative\nimpacts on our financial position, including\npossible constraints on liquidity and capital,\nas well as higher costs of capital. Even after\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may\ncontinue to experience adverse impacts to our\nbusiness and results of operations, which\ncould be material, as a result of the\nmacroeconomic impact and any recession that\nhas occurred or may occur in the future.\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify\nour business practices and operations,\nincluding providing a range of forbearance\noptions to our customers in certain\ncircumstances, which could impact our credit\nmetrics, financial condition, capital and\nresults of operations. We may need to further\nmodify our practices and operations as this\nevent unfolds. We have also implemented work-\nfrom-home policies for a vast majority of our\nemployees, and social distancing plans for our\nemployees who are working from Capital One\nfacilities. Nearly all of our Caf\u00e9s and bank\nbranches across our network are open with\nincreased safety precautions. We will continue\nto monitor local conditions to ensure the\nsafety of our associates and customers while\nproviding critical banking services. These\nmeasures could impair our ability to perform\ncritical functions and may adversely impact\nour results of operations. In addition, these\nmeasures and other changes in consumer\nbehavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\nmay require changes to retail distribution\nstrategies and adversely impact our\ninvestments in our bank premises and equipment\nand other retail distribution assets, leading\nto increased costs and exposure to additional\nrisks. We may take further actions as required\nby government authorities or that we otherwise\ndetermine are in the best interests of our\ncustomers, employees and business partners.\n\nFederal, state, local and foreign governmental\nauthorities have enacted, and may enact in the\nfuture, legislation, regulations and protocols\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding governmental programs intended to\nprovide economic relief to businesses and\nindividuals. We have participated in certain\nof these programs, including participating as\nan eligible lender in the Small Business\nAdministration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program.\nOur participation in and execution of any such\nprograms may cause operational, compliance,\nreputational and credit risks, which could\nresult in litigation, governmental action or\nother forms of loss. The extent of these\nimpacts, which may be substantial, will depend\non the degree of our participation in these\nprograms. There remains significant\nuncertainty regarding the measures that\nauthorities will enact in the future and the\nultimate impact of the legislation,\nregulations and protocols that have been and\nwill be enacted. Moreover, we expect that the\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten\nmany of the other known risks described\nherein. See Part I\u2014Item\n1.\u2014Business\u2014Overview\u2014Coronavirus Disease 2019\n(COVID-19) Pandemic.\n\nChanges and instability in the macroeconomic\nenvironment, consumer confidence and customer\nbehavior may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe offer a broad array of financial products\nand services to consumers, small businesses\nand commercial clients. A prolonged period of\neconomic volatility, slow growth, or a\nsignificant deterioration in economic\nconditions, in the U.S., Canada or the U.K.,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations\nas customers default on their loans, maintain\nlower deposit levels or, in the case of credit\ncard accounts, carry lower balances and reduce\ncredit card purchase activity.\n\nSome of the risks we face in connection with\nadverse changes and instability in the\nmacroeconomic environment, including changes\nin consumer confidence levels and behavior,\ninclude the following:\n\n\u2022 Changes in payment patterns, increases in\ndelinquencies and default rates, decreased\nconsumer spending, lower demand for credit and\nshifts in consumer payment behavior towards\navoiding late fees, finance charges and other\nfees;\n\n\u2022 Increases in our charge-off rate caused by\nbankruptcies and reduced ability to recover\ndebt that we have previously charged-off;\n\n\u2022 Decreased reliability of the process and\nmodels we use to estimate our allowance for\nloan and lease losses, particularly if\nunexpected variations in key inputs and\nassumptions cause actual losses to diverge\nfrom the projections of our models\n                                              \n  25    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nand our estimates become increasingly subject\nto management\u2019s judgment. See \u201c We face risks\nresulting from the extensive use of models and\ndata. \u201d\n\nThe U.K. and the European Union agreed to a\nfree trade deal at the end of 2020 relating to\nthe U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union\n(\u201cBrexit\u201d). While this deal provides greater\nnear-term stability, the on-going impact of\nBrexit and its full effects on the U.K.\neconomy and our business related thereto\nremain uncertain. We continue to consider and\nmonitor the potential impacts, and other\nfactors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, that\ncould also impact U.K. economic performance.\n\nFinancial market instability and volatility\ncould adversely affect our business.\n\nOur ability to borrow from other financial\ninstitutions or to engage in funding\ntransactions on favorable terms or at all\ncould be adversely affected by disruptions in\nthe capital markets or other events, including\nactions by rating agencies and deteriorating\ninvestor expectations, which could limit our\naccess to funding. In addition, fluctuations\nin interest rates, credit spreads and other\nmarket factors could negatively impact our\nresults of operations. Both shorter-term and\nlonger-term interest rates remain below long-\nterm historical averages and the yield curve\nhas been relatively flat compared to past\nperiods. A flat yield curve combined with low\ninterest rates generally leads to lower\nrevenue and reduced margins because it tends\nto limit our ability to increase the spread\nbetween asset yields and funding costs.\nSustained periods of time with a flat yield\ncurve coupled with low interest rates, or an\ninversion of the yield curve, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our net interest\nmargin and earnings.\n\nIn response to the economic consequences of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve\nlowered its target for the federal funds rate\nto a range of 0% to 0.25%. Such low rates\nincrease the risk in the U.S. of a negative\ninterest rate environment in which interest\nrates drop below zero, either broadly or for\nsome types of instruments. For example, yields\non one-month and three-month Treasuries\nbriefly dropped below zero in March 2020. Such\nan occurrence would likely further reduce the\ninterest we earn on loans and other interest-\nearning assets, while also likely requiring us\nto pay to maintain our deposits with the\nFederal Reserve. Our systems may not be able\nto handle adequately a negative interest rate\nenvironment and not all variable rate\ninstruments are designed for such a\ncircumstance. We cannot predict the nature or\ntiming of future changes in monetary policies\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic or the\nprecise effects that they may have on our\nactivities and financial results.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nWe may experience increased delinquencies,\ncredit losses, inaccurate estimates and\ninadequate reserves.\n\nLike other lenders, we face the risk that our\ncustomers will not repay their loans. A\ncustomer\u2019s ability and willingness to repay us\ncan be adversely affected by increases in\ntheir payment obligations to other lenders,\nwhether as a result of higher debt levels or\nrising interest rates, by restricted\navailability of credit generally, or by the\nrevenue and income of the borrower. We may\nfail to quickly identify and reduce our\nexposure to customers that are likely to\ndefault on their payment obligations, whether\nby closing credit lines or restricting\nauthorizations. Our ability to manage credit\nrisk also is affected by legal or regulatory\nchanges (such as restrictions on collections,\nbankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations\nand re-age guidance), competitors\u2019 actions and\nconsumer behavior, and depends on the\neffectiveness of our collections staff,\ntechniques and models.\n\nRising losses or leading indicators of rising\nlosses (such as higher delinquencies, higher\nrates of nonperforming loans, higher\nbankruptcy rates, lower collateral values,\nelevated unemployment rates or changing market\nterms) may require us to increase our\nallowance for credit losses, which may degrade\nour profitability if we are unable to raise\nrevenue or reduce costs to compensate for\nhigher losses. In particular, we face the\nfollowing risks in this area:\n\n\u2022 Missed Payments: Our customers may miss\npayments. Loan charge-offs (including from\nbankruptcies) are generally preceded by missed\npayments or other indications of worsening\nfinancial condition for our customers.\nHistorically, customers are more likely to\nmiss payments during an economic downturn or\nprolonged periods of slow economic growth. In\naddition, we face the risk that consumer and\ncommercial customer behavior may change (for\nexample, an increase in the unwillingness or\ninability of customers to repay debt, which\nmay be heightened by increasing interest rates\nor levels of consumer debt), causing a long-\nterm rise in delinquencies and charge-offs.\n\n\u2022 Incorrect Estimates of Expected Losses: The\ncredit quality of our portfolio can have a\nsignificant impact on our earnings. We allow\nfor and reserve against credit risks based on\nour assessment of expected credit losses in\nour loan portfolios. This process, which is\ncritical to our financial condition and\nresults of operations, requires complex\njudgments, including forecasts of economic\nconditions. We may underestimate our expected\nlosses and fail to hold an allowance for\ncredit losses sufficient to account for these\nlosses. Incorrect assumptions could lead to\nmaterial underestimations of expected credit\nlosses and an inadequate allowance for credit\nlosses.\n                                              \n  26    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Inaccurate Underwriting: Our ability to\naccurately assess the creditworthiness of our\ncustomers may diminish, which could result in\nan increase in our credit losses and a\ndeterioration of our returns. See \u201c Our risk\nmanagement strategies may not be fully\neffective in mitigating our risk exposures in\nall market environments or against all types\nof risk .\u201d\n\n\u2022 Business Mix: We engage in a diverse mix of\nbusinesses with a broad range of potential\ncredit exposure. Because we originate a\nrelatively greater proportion of consumer\nloans in our loan portfolio compared to other\nlarge bank peers and originate both prime and\nsubprime credit card accounts and auto loans,\nwe may experience higher delinquencies and a\ngreater number of accounts charging off\ncompared to other large bank peers, which\ncould result in increased credit losses,\noperating costs and regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, a change in this business mix\nover time to include proportionally more\nconsumer loans or subprime credit card\naccounts or auto loans could adversely affect\nthe credit quality of our portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Increasing Charge-off Recognition/Allowance\nfor Credit Losses: We account for the\nallowance for credit losses according to\naccounting and regulatory guidelines and\nrules, including Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) standards and the\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination\nCouncil (\u201cFFIEC\u201d) Account Management Guidance.\nEffective as of January 1, 2020, we adopted\nthe CECL standard which is based on expected\nlifetime losses rather than incurred losses.\nAdoption of the CECL standard has resulted and\nmay continue to result in an increase to our\nreserves for credit losses on financial\ninstruments with a resulting adverse impact on\nour financial condition. The continued impact\nof CECL on our future results will depend on\nthe characteristics of our financial\ninstruments, economic conditions, and our\neconomic and loss forecasts. The application\nof the CECL standard requires us to increase\nreserves faster and to a higher level in an\neconomic downturn, resulting in greater impact\nto our results and our capital ratios than we\nwould have experienced in similar\ncircumstances prior to the adoption of CECL.\nIn addition, because credit cards represent a\nsignificant portion of our product mix, we\ncould be disproportionately affected by use of\nthe CECL standard, as compared to our large\nbank peers with a different product mix. See\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Accounting Changes and Developments\u201d for\nadditional information.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Asset Values: The collateral we\nhave on secured loans could be insufficient to\ncompensate us for credit losses. When\ncustomers default on their secured loans, we\nattempt to recover collateral where\npermissible and appropriate. However, the\nvalue of the collateral may not be sufficient\nto compensate us for the amount of the unpaid\nloan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering\nthe remaining balance from our customers.\nDecreases in real estate and other asset\nvalues adversely affect the collateral value\nfor our commercial lending activities, while\nthe auto business is similarly exposed to\ncollateral risks arising from the auction\nmarkets that determine used car prices.\nBorrowers may be less likely to continue\nmaking payments on loans if the value of the\nproperty used as collateral for the loan is\nless than what the borrower owes, even if the\nborrower is still financially able to make the\npayments. In that circumstance, the recovery\nof such property could be insufficient to\ncompensate us for the value of these loans\nupon a default. In our auto business, business\nand economic conditions that negatively affect\nhousehold incomes, housing prices and consumer\nbehavior, as well as technological advances\nthat make older cars obsolete faster, could\ndecrease (i) the demand for new and used\nvehicles and (ii) the value of the collateral\nunderlying our portfolio of auto loans, which\ncould cause the number of consumers who become\ndelinquent or default on their loans to\nincrease.\n\n\u2022 Geographic and Industry Concentration:\nAlthough our consumer lending is\ngeographically diversified, approximately 27%\nof our commercial loan portfolio is\nconcentrated in the tri-state area of New\nYork, New Jersey and Connecticut. The regional\neconomic conditions in the tri-state area\naffect the demand for our commercial products\nand services as well as the ability of our\ncustomers to repay their commercial loans and\nthe value of the collateral securing these\nloans. An economic downturn or prolonged\nperiod of slow economic growth in, or a\ncatastrophic event that disproportionately\naffects, the tri-state area could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the performance of\nour commercial loan portfolio and our results\nof operations. In addition, our Commercial\nBanking strategy includes an industry-specific\nfocus. If any of the industries that we focus\non experience changes, we may experience\nincreased credit losses and our results of\noperations could be adversely impacted. For\nexample, as of December 31, 2020, healthcare\nand healthcare-related real estate loans\nrepresented approximately 19% of our total\ncommercial loan portfolio. If healthcare-\nrelated industries or any of the other\nindustries that we focus on experience adverse\nchanges, we may experience increased credit\nlosses and our results of operations could be\nadversely impacted.\n                                              \n  27    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   Capital and Liquidity Risk                 \n                                              \nWe may not be able to maintain adequate\ncapital or liquidity levels, which could have\na negative impact on our financial results and\nour ability to return capital to our\nstockholders.\n\nFinancial institutions are subject to\nextensive and complex capital and liquidity\nrequirements. These requirements affect our\nability to lend, grow deposit balances, make\nacquisitions and make most capital\ndistributions. Failure to maintain adequate\ncapital or liquidity levels, whether due to\nadverse developments in our business or the\neconomy or to changes in the applicable\nrequirements, could subject us to a variety of\nremedies available to our regulators. These\ninclude limitations on the ability to pay\ndividends, repurchase shares and the issuance\nof a capital directive to increase capital.\nSuch limitations could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and results of\noperations.\n\nWe consider various factors in the management\nof capital, including the impact of stress on\nour capital levels, as determined by both our\ninternal modeling and the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nmodeling of our capital position in\nsupervisory stress tests and CCAR. There can\nbe significant differences between our\nmodeling and the Federal Reserve\u2019s estimates\nfor a given scenario and between the capital\nneeds suggested by our internal bank holding\ncompany scenarios relative to the supervisory\nscenarios. Therefore, although our estimated\ncapital levels under stress disclosed as part\nof the CCAR or DFAST processes may suggest\nthat we have substantial capacity to return\ncapital to stockholders and remain well\ncapitalized under stress, the Federal\nReserve\u2019s modeling, our internal modeling of\nanother scenario or other factors related to\nour capital management process may result in a\nmaterially lower capacity to return capital to\nstockholders than that indicated by the\nprojections released in the CCAR or DFAST\nprocesses. This in turn, could lead to\nrestrictions on our ability to pay dividends\nand engage in share repurchase transactions.\nSee \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u201d for additional information.\n\nIn addition, the current capital and liquidity\nrequirements are subject to change. The\nFederal Banking Agencies finalized the\nTailoring Rule in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nUnder the Tailoring Rule, we are a Category\nIII institution, and are no longer subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches and\nassociated capital requirements, but we\ncontinue to be subject to the countercyclical\ncapital buffer and supplementary leverage\nratio. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve\nissued a final rule to implement the stress\ncapital buffer requirement. This final rule\nbecame effective in May 2020. Pursuant to the\nStress Capital Buffer Rule, the Federal\nReserve will use the results of its\nsupervisory stress test to determine the size\nof a large banking institution\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement, which replaces the\nprevious 2.5% capital conservation buffer\nunder the Basel III Standardized Approach. Our\nstress capital buffer requirement is 5.6% for\nthe period from October 1, 2020 through\nSeptember 30, 2021, at which point a revised\nstress capital buffer requirement will be\napplicable to us based on our 2021 stress\ntesting results. In addition, on June 25, 2020\nthe Federal Reserve introduced measures to\nensure that large BHCs maintained a high level\nof capital resilience. Specifically, the\nFederal Reserve required certain large BHCs,\nincluding us, to suspend share repurchases and\ncap common dividends during the third and\nfourth quarters of 2020. Consistent with the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s capital distribution\nrestrictions, we reduced our quarterly\ndividend on our common stock from $0.40 per\nshare to $0.10 per share for the third quarter\nof 2020, which we maintained into the fourth\nquarter of 2020. The Federal Banking Agencies\nalso finalized rules to implement the NSFR in\nOctober 2020. The NSFR is designed to ensure\nthat banking organizations maintain a stable,\nlong-term funding profile in relation to their\nasset composition and off-balance sheet\nactivities and its requirements will become\neffective as of July 1, 2021. On December 18,\n2020, the Federal Reserve extended the capital\ndistribution restrictions for all\nparticipating BHCs to the first quarter of\n2021, with certain modifications. In\nparticular, for the first quarter of 2021,\nparticipating BHCs may resume share\nrepurchases however the aggregate amount of\ndividend payments and share repurchases will\nbe limited to an amount based on net income\nearned in the preceding four calendar\nquarters. See \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d for\nadditional information. Further changes to\napplicable capital and liquidity requirements\ncould result in unexpected or new limitations\non our ability to pay dividends and engage in\nshare repurchases.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nWe face risks related to our operational,\ntechnological and organizational\ninfrastructure.\nOur ability to retain and attract customers\ndepends on our ability to develop, operate,\nand adapt our technology and organizational\ninfrastructure in a rapidly changing\nenvironment. In addition, we must accurately\nprocess, record and monitor an increasingly\nlarge number of complex transactions. Digital\ntechnology, data and software development are\ndeeply embedded into our business model and\nhow we work.\n\nSimilar to other large corporations, we are\nexposed to operational risk that can manifest\nitself in many ways, such as errors in\nexecution, inadequate processes, inaccurate\nmodels, faulty or disabled technological\ninfrastructure, and fraud by employees or\n                                              \n  28    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\npersons outside of our company. In addition,\nwe are heavily dependent on the security,\ncapability and continuous availability of the\ntechnology systems that we use to manage our\ninternal financial and other systems, monitor\nrisk and compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, provide services to our\ncustomers, develop and offer new products and\ncommunicate with stakeholders. We also face\nrisk of adverse customer impacts and business\ndisruption arising from the execution of\nstrategic initiatives we may pursue across our\noperations.\n\nIf we do not maintain the necessary\noperational, technological and organizational\ninfrastructure to operate our business,\nincluding to maintain the security of that\ninfrastructure, our business and reputation\ncould be materially adversely affected. We\nalso are subject to disruptions to our\noperating systems arising from events that are\nwholly or partially beyond our control, which\nmay include computer viruses, electrical or\ntelecommunications outages, design flaws in\nfoundational components or platforms,\navailability and quality of vulnerability\npatches from key vendors, cyber-attacks\n(including Distributed Denial of Service\n(\u201cDDOS\u201d) and other attacks on our\ninfrastructure as discussed below), natural\ndisasters, other damage to property or\nphysical assets, or events arising from local\nor larger scale politics, including terrorist\nacts. Any failure to maintain our\ninfrastructure or disruption of our operating\nsystems and applications could diminish our\nability to operate our businesses, service\ncustomer accounts and protect customers\u2019\ninformation, or result in potential liability\nto customers, reputational damage, regulatory\nintervention and customers\u2019 loss of confidence\nin our businesses, any of which could result\nin a material adverse effect.\n\nWe also rely on the business infrastructure\nand systems of third parties with which we do\nbusiness and to whom we outsource the\noperation, maintenance and development of our\ninformation technology and communications\nsystems. We have migrated substantially all,\nand intend to migrate all, of our core\ninformation technology systems and customer-\nfacing applications to third-party cloud\ninfrastructure platforms, principally AWS. If\nwe do not complete the transition or fail to\nadminister these new environments in a well-\nmanaged, secure and effective manner, or if\nAWS platforms become unavailable or do not\nmeet their service level agreements for any\nreason, we may experience unplanned service\ndisruption or unforeseen costs which could\nresult in material harm to our business and\nresults of operations. We must successfully\ndevelop and maintain information, financial\nreporting, disclosure, data-protection and\nother controls adapted to our reliance on\noutside platforms and providers. In addition,\nAWS, or other service providers, could\nexperience system breakdowns or failures,\noutages, downtime, cyber-attacks, adverse\nchanges to financial condition, bankruptcy, or\nother adverse conditions, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and\nreputation. Thus, the substantial amount of\nour infrastructure that we outsource to AWS or\nto other third parties may increase our risk\nexposure.\n\nAny disruptions, failures or inaccuracies of\nour operational and technology systems and\nmodels, including those associated with\nimprovements or modifications to such systems\nand models, could cause us to be unable to\nmarket and manage our products and services,\nmanage our risk, meet our regulatory\nobligations or report our financial results in\na timely and accurate manner, all of which\ncould have a negative impact on our results of\noperations. In addition, our ongoing\ninvestments in infrastructure, which are\nnecessary to maintain a competitive business,\nintegrate acquisitions and establish scalable\noperations, may increase our expenses. As our\nbusiness develops, changes or expands,\nadditional expenses can arise as a result of a\nreevaluation of business strategies,\nmanagement of outsourced services, asset\npurchases or other acquisitions, structural\nreorganization, compliance with new laws or\nregulations, or the integration of newly\nacquired businesses, or the prevention or\noccurrence of data security incidents. If we\nare unable to successfully manage our\nexpenses, our financial results will be\nnegatively affected. Changes to our business,\nincluding as a result of our strategic\nobjectives, also requires robust governance to\nensure that our objectives are executed as\nintended without adversely impacting our\ncustomers, associates, operations or financial\nperformance. Ineffective change management\noversight and governance over the execution of\nour strategic objectives could expose us to\noperational, strategic and reputational risk\nand could negatively impact customers or our\nfinancial performance.\n\nTheft, loss or misuse of information as a\nresult of a cyber-attack may result in\nincreased costs, reductions in revenue,\nreputational damage and business disruptions.\n\nOur products and services involve the\ngathering, authenticating, managing,\nprocessing, and the storing and transmission\nof sensitive and confidential information\nregarding our customers and their accounts,\nour employees and third parties with which we\ndo business. Our ability to provide such\nproducts and services, many of which are web-\nbased, depends upon the management and\nsafeguarding of information, software,\nmethodologies and business secrets. To provide\nthese products and services to, as well as\ncommunicate with, our customers, we rely on\ninformation systems and infrastructure,\nincluding software and data engineering, and\ninformation security personnel, digital\ntechnologies, computer and email systems,\nsoftware, networks and other web-based\ntechnologies. We also have arrangements in\nplace with third parties through which we\nshare and receive information about their\ncustomers who are or may become our customers.\n                                              \n  29    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTechnologies, systems, networks and devices of\nCapital One or our employees, service\nproviders or other third parties with whom we\ninteract may continue to be the subject of\nattempted unauthorized access, mishandling or\nmisuse of information, denial-of-service\nattacks, computer viruses, website defacement,\nhacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or\nother forms of social engineering, and other\nforms of cyber-attacks designed to obtain\nconfidential information, destroy data,\ndisrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems\nor cause other damage, and other events. These\nthreats, such as the Cybersecurity Incident,\nmay derive from error, fraud or malice on the\npart of our employees, insiders or third\nparties or may result from accidental\ntechnological failure. Any of these parties\nmay also attempt to fraudulently induce\nemployees, customers or other third-party\nusers of our systems to disclose sensitive\ninformation in order to gain access to our\ndata or that of our customers or third parties\nwith whom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or\notherwise improper payment. Further, cyber and\ninformation security risks for large financial\ninstitutions like us continue to increase due\nto the proliferation of new technologies, the\nuse of the internet to conduct financial\ntransactions, and the increased sophistication\nand activities of organized crime,\nperpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists,\nactivists, formal and informal\ninstrumentalities of foreign governments and\nother external parties. In addition, our\ncustomers access our products and services\nusing computers, smartphones, tablets and\nother mobile devices that are beyond our\nsecurity control systems.\n\nThe methods and techniques employed by\nperpetrators of fraud and others to attack,\ndisable, degrade or sabotage platforms,\nsystems and applications change frequently,\nare increasingly sophisticated and often are\nnot fully recognized or understood until after\nthey have occurred, and some techniques could\noccur and persist for an extended period of\ntime before being detected. For example,\nalthough we immediately fixed the\nconfiguration vulnerability that was exploited\nin the Cybersecurity Incident once we\ndiscovered the unauthorized access, a period\nof time elapsed between the occurrence of the\nunauthorized access and the time when we\ndiscovered it. In other circumstances, we and\nour third-party service providers and partners\nmay be unable to anticipate or identify\ncertain attack methods in order to implement\neffective preventative measures or mitigate or\nremediate the damages caused in a timely\nmanner. We may also be unable to hire and\ndevelop talent capable of detecting,\nmitigating or remediating these risks.\nAlthough we seek to maintain a robust suite of\nauthentication and layered information\nsecurity controls, including our cyber threat\nanalytics, data encryption and tokenization\ntechnologies, anti-malware defenses and\nvulnerability management program, any one or\ncombination of these controls could fail to\ndetect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a\ntimely manner. We will likely face an\nincreasing number of attempted cyber-attacks\nas we expand our mobile and other internet-\nbased products and services, as well as our\nusage of mobile and cloud technologies and as\nwe provide more of these services to a greater\nnumber of retail clients.\n\nA disruption or breach, including as a result\nof a cyber-attack such as the Cybersecurity\nIncident, or media reports of perceived\nsecurity vulnerabilities at Capital One or at\nour third-party service providers, could\nresult in significant legal and financial\nexposure, regulatory intervention, litigation\nand remediation costs, card reissuance,\nsupervisory liability, damage to our\nreputation or loss of confidence in the\nsecurity of our systems, products and services\nthat could adversely affect our business. We\nand other U.S. financial services providers\ncontinue to be targeted with evolving and\nadaptive cybersecurity threats from\nsophisticated third parties. We are continuing\nto assess the impact of the Cybersecurity\nIncident and there can be no assurance that\nadditional unauthorized access or cyber\nincidents will not occur or that we will not\nsuffer material losses in the future.\nUnauthorized access or cybersecurity incidents\ncould occur more frequently and on a more\nsignificant scale. If future attacks like\nthese are successful or if customers are\nunable to access their accounts online for\nother reasons, it could adversely impact our\nability to service customer accounts or loans,\ncomplete financial transactions for our\ncustomers or otherwise operate any of our\nbusinesses or services. In addition, a breach\nor attack affecting one of our third-party\nservice providers or partners could harm our\nbusiness even if we do not control the service\nthat is attacked.\n\nIn addition, the increasing prevalence and the\nevolution of cyber-attacks and other efforts\nto breach or disrupt our systems or those of\nour partners, retailers or other market\nparticipants has led, and will likely continue\nto lead, to increased costs to us with respect\nto preventing, mitigating and remediating\nthese risks, as well as any related attempted\nfraud. In order to address ongoing and future\nrisks, including from the Cybersecurity\nIncident, we must expend significant resources\nto support protective security measures,\ninvestigate and remediate any vulnerabilities\nof our information systems and infrastructure\nand invest in new technology designed to\nmitigate security risks. The Cybersecurity\nIncident, or successful cyber-attacks at other\nlarge financial institutions or other market\nparticipants (whether or not we are impacted),\ncould lead to a general loss of customer\nconfidence in financial institutions that\ncould negatively affect us, including harming\nthe market perception of the effectiveness of\nour security measures or the financial system\nin general which could result in reduced use\nof our financial products. We have insurance\nagainst some cyber-risks and attacks,\nincluding insurance that is expected to cover\ncertain costs associated with the\nCybersecurity Incident; nonetheless, our\ninsurance coverage may not be sufficient to\noffset the impact of a material loss event,\nand such insurance may increase in cost or\ncease to be available on commercial terms in\nthe future.\n                                              \n  30    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nPotential data protection and privacy\nincidents, and our required compliance with\nregulations related to these areas, may\nincrease our costs, reduce our revenue and\nlimit our ability to pursue business\nopportunities.\n\nA breach, failure or other disruption of our\ninformation systems or infrastructure or data\nmanagement processes, or those of our\ncustomers, partners, service providers or\nother market participants, could lead,\ndepending on the nature of the incident, to\nthe unauthorized or unintended access to and\nrelease, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss\nor destruction of personal or confidential\ndata about our customers, employees or other\nthird parties in our possession. Any party\nthat obtains this personal or confidential\ndata through a breach or disruption may use\nthis information for ransom, to be paid by us\nor a third-party, as part of a fraudulent\nactivity that is part of a broader criminal\nactivity, or for other illicit purposes.\nFurther, such disruption or breach could also\nresult in unauthorized access to our\nproprietary information, intellectual\nproperty, software, methodologies and business\nsecrets and in unauthorized transactions in\nCapital One accounts or unauthorized access to\npersonal or confidential information\nmaintained by those entities. There has been a\nsignificant proliferation of consumer\ninformation available on the internet\nresulting from breaches of third-party\nentities, including personal information, log-\nin credentials and authentication data. While\nwe were not directly involved in these third-\nparty breach events, the stolen information\ncan create a vulnerability for our customers\nif their Capital One log-in credentials are\nthe same as or similar to the credentials that\nhave been compromised on other sites. This\nvulnerability could include the risk of\nunauthorized account access, data loss and\nfraud. The use of artificial intelligence,\n\u201cbots\u201d or other automation software, can\nincrease the velocity and efficacy of these\ntypes of attacks.\n\nWe are continuing to assess the impact of the\nCybersecurity Incident. The Cybersecurity\nIncident, other data security incidents we may\nexperience in the future, or media reports of\nperceived security vulnerabilities at Capital\nOne or at third-party service providers, could\nresult in significant legal and financial\nexposure, regulatory intervention, remediation\ncosts, card reissuance, supervisory liability,\ndamage to our reputation or loss of confidence\nin the security of our systems, products and\nservices that could adversely affect our\nbusiness.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of continuously\nevolving and developing laws and regulations\nin the United States and abroad regarding\nprivacy, data protection and data security,\nincluding those related to the collection,\nstorage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer\nand security of personal data. Significant\nuncertainty exists as privacy and data\nprotection laws may be interpreted and applied\ndifferently from country to country and may\ncreate inconsistent or conflicting\nrequirements. For example, in Canada we are\nsubject to the Personal Information Protection\nand Electronic Documents Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d). In\naddition, the General Data Protection\nRegulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) applies EU data protection\nlaw to all companies processing data of EU\nresidents, regardless of the company\u2019s\nlocation. More recently, on January 1, 2020,\nthe CCPA went into effect for companies doing\nbusiness in California. These laws impose\nstrict requirements regarding the collection,\nstorage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer\nand security of personal data, which may have\nadverse consequences, including severe\nmonetary penalties. Our efforts to comply with\nPIPEDA, GDPR, CCPA and other privacy and data\nprotection laws entail substantial expenses,\nmay divert resources from other initiatives\nand projects, and could limit the services we\nare able to offer. Furthermore, enforcement\nactions and investigations by regulatory\nauthorities related to data security incidents\nand privacy violations continue to increase.\nThe enactment of more restrictive laws, rules,\nregulations, or future enforcement actions or\ninvestigations could impact us through\nincreased costs or restrictions on our\nbusiness, and noncompliance could result in\nmonetary or other penalties and significant\nlegal liability.\nWe face risks resulting from the extensive use\nof models and data.\nWe rely on quantitative models, and our\nability to manage data and aggregate data in\nan accurate and timely manner, assess and\nmanage our various risk exposures, estimate\ncertain financial values and manage compliance\nwith required regulatory capital requirements.\nModels may be used in such processes as\ndetermining the pricing of various products,\ngrading loans and extending credit, measuring\ninterest rate and other market risks,\npredicting deposit levels or loan losses,\nassessing capital adequacy and calculating\neconomic and regulatory capital levels,\nestimating the value of financial instruments\nand balance sheet items, and other operational\nfunctions. Our risk reporting and management,\nincluding business decisions based on\ninformation incorporating models, depend on\nthe effectiveness of our models and our\npolicies, programs, processes and practices\ngoverning how data is acquired, validated,\nstored, protected, processed and analyzed. Any\nissues with the quality or effectiveness of\nour data aggregation and validation\nprocedures, as well as the quality and\nintegrity of data inputs, formulas or\nalgorithms, could result in inaccurate\nforecasts, ineffective risk management\npractices or inaccurate risk reporting. In\naddition, models based on historical data sets\nmight not be accurate predictors of future\noutcomes and their ability to appropriately\npredict future outcomes may degrade over time.\nWhile we continuously update our policies,\nprograms, processes and practices, many of our\ndata management, aggregation and\nimplementation processes are manual and\nsubject to human error or system failure.\nFailure to manage data effectively and to\naggregate data in an accurate and timely\nmanner may limit our ability to\n                                              \n  31    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nmanage current and emerging risk, to produce\naccurate financial, regulatory and operational\nreporting as well as to manage changing\nbusiness needs. If our risk management\nframework is ineffective, we could suffer\nunexpected losses which could materially\nadversely affect our results of operation or\nfinancial condition. Also, any information we\nprovide to the public or to our regulators\nbased on poorly designed or implemented models\ncould be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the\ndecisions that our regulators make, including\nthose related to capital distribution to our\nstockholders, could be affected adversely due\nto the perception that the quality of the\nmodels used to generate the relevant\ninformation is insufficient.\n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Risk                   \n                                              \nCompliance with new and existing laws,\nregulations and regulatory expectations is\ncostly and complex.\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory\noversight by the federal banking regulators to\nensure that we build systems and processes\nthat are commensurate with the nature of our\nbusiness and that meet the risk management and\nprudential standards issued by our regulators.\nA wide array of banking and consumer lending\nlaws apply to almost every aspect of our\nbusiness. Failure to comply with these laws\nand regulations could result in financial,\nstructural and operational penalties,\nincluding significant fines and criminal\nsanctions, and/or damage to our reputation\nwith regulators, our customers or the public.\nHiring, training and retaining qualified\ncompliance and legal personnel, and\nestablishing and maintaining compliance-\nrelated systems, infrastructure and processes,\nis difficult and these efforts could limit our\nability to invest in other business\nopportunities. Furthermore, applicable rules\nand regulations may affect us in an unforeseen\nmanner, or may have a disproportionate impact\non us as compared to our competitors. Over the\nlast several years, state and federal\nregulators have focused on compliance with the\nBank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering\n(\u201cAML\u201d) laws, data integrity and security, use\nof service providers, fair lending and other\nconsumer protection issues. For example, in\nJuly 2015, Capital One entered into a consent\norder with the OCC to address concerns about\nour AML program and in October 2018, Capital\nOne paid a civil monetary penalty assessed by\nthe OCC relating to our AML program. The OCC\nlifted the AML consent order in November 2019.\nIn addition, in August 2020 we entered into\nconsent orders with the Federal Reserve and\nthe OCC resulting from regulatory reviews of\nthe Cybersecurity Incident and relating to\nongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and\noperational risk management processes, and we\npaid a civil monetary penalty as part of the\nOCC agreement. In January 2021, we also paid a\ncivil monetary penalty assessed by the\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(\u201cFinCEN\u201d) against CONA in connection with our\nAML program. Failure to maintain compliance\nwith laws and regulations could result in\nsignificant additional governmental fines or\npenalties.\n\nWe have a large number of customer accounts in\nour credit card and auto lending businesses\nand we have made the strategic choice to\noriginate and service subprime credit card and\nauto loans, which typically have higher\ndelinquencies and charge-offs than prime\ncustomers. As a result, we have significant\ninvolvement with credit bureau reporting and\nthe collection and recovery of delinquent and\ncharged-off debt, primarily through customer\ncommunications, the filing of litigation\nagainst customers in default, the periodic\nsale of charged-off debt and vehicle\nrepossession. These activities are subject to\nenhanced legal and regulatory scrutiny from\nregulators, courts and legislators. Any future\nchanges to our business practices in these\nareas, including our debt collection\npractices, whether mandated by regulators,\ncourts, legislators or otherwise, or any legal\nliabilities resulting from our business\npractices, including our debt collection\npractices, could have a material adverse\nimpact on our financial condition.\n\nThe legislative and regulatory environment is\nbeyond our control, may change rapidly and\nunpredictably and may negatively influence our\nrevenue, costs, earnings, growth, liquidity\nand capital levels. In addition, some rules\nand regulations may be subject to litigation\nor other challenges that delay or modify their\nimplementation and impact on us. Adoption of\nnew technologies, such as distributed ledger\ntechnologies, artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning technologies, can present\nunforeseen challenges in applying and relying\non existing compliance systems.\n\nCertain laws and regulations, and any\ninterpretations and applications with respect\nthereto, are generally intended to protect\nconsumers, borrowers, depositors, the DIF, the\nU.S. banking and financial system, and\nfinancial markets as a whole, but not\nstockholders. Our success depends on our\nability to maintain compliance with both\nexisting and new laws and regulations. For a\ndescription of the material laws and\nregulations to which we are subject, see \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation.\u201d\nOur businesses are subject to the risk of\nincreased litigation, government\ninvestigations and regulatory enforcement.\nOur businesses are subject to increased\nlitigation, government investigations and\nother regulatory enforcement risks as a result\nof a number of factors and from various\nsources, including the highly regulated nature\nof the financial services industry, the focus\nof state and federal prosecutors on banks and\nthe financial services industry and the\nstructure of the credit card industry.\n                                              \n  32    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties involved in\nlitigation, government investigations and\nregulatory enforcement decisions, and the very\nlarge or indeterminate damages sought in some\nmatters asserted against us, there can be\nsignificant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these kinds of\nmatters. The finding, or even the assertion,\nof substantial legal liability against us\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial condition and could\ncause significant reputational harm to us,\nwhich could seriously harm our business. The\nCybersecurity Incident has resulted in\nlitigation, government investigations and\nother regulatory enforcement inquiries.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions, such as\nourselves, face significant regulatory\nscrutiny, which can lead to public enforcement\nactions or non-public supervisory actions. We\nand our subsidiaries are subject to\ncomprehensive regulation and periodic\nexamination by, among other regulatory bodies,\nthe Federal Reserve, the SEC, OCC, FDIC and\nCFPB. We have been subject to enforcement\nactions by many of these and other regulators\nand may continue to be involved in such\nactions, including governmental inquiries,\ninvestigations and enforcement proceedings,\nincluding by the OCC, Department of Justice,\nFinCEN and state Attorneys General.\n\nWe expect that regulators and governmental\nenforcement bodies will continue taking formal\nenforcement actions against financial\ninstitutions in addition to addressing\nsupervisory concerns through non-public\nsupervisory actions or findings, which could\ninvolve restrictions on our activities, or our\nability to make acquisitions or otherwise\nexpand our business, among other limitations\nthat could adversely affect our business. In\naddition, a violation of law or regulation by\nanother financial institution is likely to\ngive rise to an investigation by regulators\nand other governmental agencies of the same or\nsimilar practices by us. Furthermore, a single\nevent may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings.\nThese and other initiatives from governmental\nauthorities and officials may subject us to\nfurther judgments, settlements, fines or\npenalties, or cause us to restructure our\noperations and activities or to cease offering\ncertain products or services, all of which\ncould harm our reputation or lead to higher\noperational costs. Litigation, government\ninvestigations and other regulatory actions\ncould involve restrictions on our activities,\ngenerally subject us to significant fines,\nincreased expenses, restrictions on our\nactivities and damage to our reputation and\nour brand, and could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations. For additional information\nregarding legal and regulatory proceedings\nthat we are subject to, see \u201cNote\n18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and\nOthers.\u201d\n                                              \n   Other Business Risks                       \n                                              \nWe face intense competition in all of our\nmarkets.\nWe operate in a highly competitive\nenvironment, whether in making loans,\nattracting deposits or in the global payments\nindustry, and we expect competitive conditions\nto continue to intensify with respect to most\nof our products. We compete on the basis of\nthe rates we pay on deposits and the rates and\nother terms we charge on the loans we\noriginate or purchase, as well as the quality\nand range of our customer service, products,\ninnovation and experience. This increasingly\ncompetitive environment is primarily a result\nof changes in technology, product delivery\nsystems and regulation, as well as the\nemergence of new or significantly larger\nfinancial services providers, all of which may\naffect our customers\u2019 expectations and\ndemands. In addition to offering competitive\nproducts and services, we invest in and\nconduct marketing campaigns to attract and\ninform customers.\n\nSome of our competitors, including new and\nemerging competitors in the digital and mobile\npayments space and other financial technology\nproviders, are not subject to the same\nregulatory requirements or legislative\nscrutiny to which we are subject, which also\ncould place us at a competitive disadvantage,\nin particular in the development of new\ntechnology platforms or the ability to rapidly\ninnovate. We compete with many forms of\npayments offered by both bank and non-bank\nproviders, including a variety of new and\nevolving alternative payment mechanisms,\nsystems and products, such as aggregators and\nweb-based and wireless payment platforms or\ntechnologies, digital or \u201ccrypto\u201d currencies,\nprepaid systems and payment services targeting\nusers of social networks, communications\nplatforms and online gaming. If we are unable\nto continue to keep pace with innovation, do\nnot effectively market our products and\nservices or are prohibited from or unwilling\nto enter emerging areas of competition, our\nbusiness and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\n\nSome of our competitors are substantially\nlarger than we are, which may give those\ncompetitors advantages, including a more\ndiversified product and customer base, the\nability to reach more customers and potential\ncustomers, operational efficiencies, broad-\nbased local distribution capabilities, lower-\ncost funding and larger existing branch\nnetworks. Many of our competitors are also\nfocusing on cross-selling their products and\ndeveloping new products or technologies, which\ncould affect our ability to maintain or grow\nexisting customer relationships or require us\nto offer lower interest rates or fees on our\nlending products or higher interest rates on\ndeposits. Competition for loans could result\nin origination of fewer loans, earning less on\nour loans or an increase in loans that perform\nbelow expectations.\n                                              \n  33    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we operate as one of\nthe largest online direct banks in the United\nStates by deposits. While direct banking\nprovides a significant opportunity to attract\nnew customers that value greater and more\nflexible access to banking services at reduced\ncosts, we face strong and increasing\ncompetition in the direct banking market.\nAggressive pricing throughout the industry may\nadversely affect the retention of existing\nbalances and the cost-efficient acquisition of\nnew deposit funds and may affect our growth\nand profitability. Customers could also close\ntheir online accounts or reduce balances or\ndeposits in favor of products and services\noffered by competitors for other reasons.\nThese shifts, which could be rapid, could\nresult from general dissatisfaction with our\nproducts or services, including concerns over\npricing, online security or our reputation.\nThe potential consequences of this competitive\nenvironment are exacerbated by the flexibility\nof direct banking and the financial and\ntechnological sophistication of our online\ncustomer base.\n\nIn our credit card business, competition for\nrewards customers may result in higher rewards\nexpenses, or we may fail to attract new\ncustomers or retain existing rewards customers\ndue to increasing competition for these\nconsumers. As of December 31, 2020, we have a\nnumber of large partnerships in our credit\ncard loan portfolio. The market for key\nbusiness partners, especially in the credit\ncard business, is very competitive, and we may\nnot be able to grow or maintain these partner\nrelationships. We face the risk that we could\nlose partner relationships, even after we have\ninvested significant resources into acquiring\nand developing the relationships. The loss of\nany of our key business partners could have a\nnegative impact on our results of operations,\nincluding lower returns, excess operating\nexpense and excess funding capacity.\n\nWe depend on our partners to effectively\npromote our cobrand and private label products\nand integrate the use of our credit cards into\ntheir retail operations. The failure by our\npartners to effectively promote and support\nour products as well as changes they may make\nin their business models could adversely\naffect card usage and our ability to achieve\nthe growth and profitability objectives of our\npartnerships. In addition, if our partners do\nnot adhere to the terms of our program\nagreements and standards, or otherwise\ndiminish the value of our brand, we may suffer\nreputational damage and customers may be less\nlikely to use our products.\n\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may\ndevelop, substantially greater financial and\nother resources than we have, may offer richer\nvalue propositions or a wider range of\nprograms and services than we offer or may use\nmore effective advertising, marketing or\ncross-selling strategies to acquire and retain\nmore customers, capture a greater share of\nspending and borrowings, attain and develop\nmore attractive cobrand card programs and\nmaintain greater merchant acceptance than we\nhave. We may not be able to compete\neffectively against these threats or respond\nor adapt to changes in consumer spending\nhabits as effectively as our competitors.\n\nIn such a competitive environment, we may lose\nentire accounts or may lose account balances\nto competing firms, or we may find it more\ncostly to maintain our existing customer base.\nCustomer attrition from any or all of our\nlending products, together with any lowering\nof interest rates or fees that we might\nimplement to retain customers, could reduce\nour revenues and therefore our earnings.\nSimilarly, unexpected customer attrition from\nour deposit products, in addition to an\nincrease in rates or services that we may\noffer to retain deposits, may increase our\nexpenses and therefore reduce our earnings.\nOur business, financial condition and results\nof operations may be adversely affected by\nmerchants\u2019 increasing focus on the fees\ncharged by credit card networks and by\nlegislation and regulation impacting such\nfees.\nCredit card interchange fees are generally one\nof the largest components of the costs that\nmerchants pay in connection with the\nacceptance of credit cards and are a\nmeaningful source of revenue for our credit\ncard businesses. Interchange fees are the\nsubject of significant and intense global\nlegal, legislative and regulatory focus, and\nthe resulting decisions, legislation and\nregulation may have a material adverse impact\non our overall business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\n\nLegislative and regulatory bodies in a number\nof countries are seeking to reduce credit card\ninterchange fees through legislation,\ncompetition-related regulatory proceedings,\ncentral bank regulation and or litigation.\nInterchange reimbursement rates in the United\nStates are set by credit card networks such as\nMasterCard and Visa. In some jurisdictions,\nsuch as Canada and certain countries in the\nEU, interchange fees and related practices are\nsubject to regulatory activity that has\nlimited the ability of certain networks to\nestablish default rates, including in some\ncases imposing caps on permissible interchange\nfees. We have already experienced these\nimpacts in our international card businesses.\nLegislators and regulators around the world\nare aware of each other\u2019s approaches to the\nregulation of the payments industry.\nConsequently, a development in one country,\nstate or region may influence regulatory\napproaches in another, such as our primary\nmarket, the United States.\n\nIn addition to this regulatory activity,\nmerchants are also seeking avenues to reduce\ninterchange fees. During the past few years,\nmerchants and their trade groups have filed\nnumerous lawsuits against Visa, MasterCard,\nAmerican Express and their card-\n                                              \n  34    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nissuing banks, claiming that their practices\ntoward merchants, including interchange and\nsimilar fees, violate federal antitrust laws.\nIn 2005, a number of entities filed antitrust\nlawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and\nseveral member banks, including our\nsubsidiaries and us, alleging among other\nthings, that the defendants conspired to fix\nthe level of interchange fees. In December\n2013, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York granted final approval of\nthe proposed class settlement. The settlement\nprovided, among other things, that merchants\nwould be entitled to join together to\nnegotiate lower interchange fees. The\nsettlement was appealed to the Second Circuit\nCourt of Appeals, which rejected the\nsettlement in June 2016; a revised settlement\nwas reached in the second half of 2018, and\nthe trial court issued its final approval of\nthe settlement in December 2019. See \u201cNote\n18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and\nOthers\u201d for further details.\n\nSome major retailers may have sufficient\nbargaining power to independently negotiate\nlower interchange fees with MasterCard and\nVisa, which could, in turn, result in lower\ninterchange fees for us when our cardholders\nundertake purchase transactions with these\nretailers. In 2016, some of the largest\nmerchants individually negotiated lower\ninterchange rates with MasterCard and/or Visa.\nThese and other merchants also continue to\nlobby aggressively for caps and restrictions\non interchange fees and their efforts may be\nsuccessful or they may in the future bring\nlegal proceedings against us or other credit\ncard and debit card issuers and networks.\n\nBeyond pursuing litigation, legislation and\nregulation, merchants may also promote forms\nof payment with lower fees, such as ACH-based\npayments, or seek to impose surcharges at the\npoint of sale for use of credit or debit\ncards. New payment systems, particularly\nmobile-based payment technologies, could also\ngain widespread adoption and lead to issuer\ntransaction fees or the displacement of credit\ncard accounts as a payment method.\n\nThe heightened focus by merchants and\nlegislative and regulatory bodies on the fees\ncharged by credit and debit card networks, and\nthe ability of certain merchants to\nsuccessfully negotiate discounts to\ninterchange fees with MasterCard and Visa or\ndevelop alternative payment systems, could\nresult in a reduction of interchange fees. Any\nresulting loss in income to us could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in\nand introduce digital and other technological\ndevelopments across all our businesses, our\nfinancial performance may suffer.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and\nsignificant technological changes and our\nability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and\nexpectations is key to our ability to grow\nrevenue and earnings. We expect digital\ntechnologies to have a significant impact on\nbanking over time. Consumers expect robust\ndigital experiences from their financial\nservices providers. The ability for customers\nto access their accounts and conduct financial\ntransactions using digital technology,\nincluding mobile applications, is an important\naspect of the financial services industry and\nfinancial institutions are rapidly introducing\nnew digital and other technology-driven\nproducts and services that aim to offer a\nbetter customer experience and to reduce\ncosts. We continue to invest in digital\ntechnology designed to attract new customers,\nfacilitate the ability of existing customers\nto conduct financial transactions and enhance\nthe customer experience related to our\nproducts and services.\n\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon\nour ability to address the needs of our\ncustomers by using digital technology to\nprovide products and services that meet their\nexpectations. The development and launch of\nnew digital products and services depends in\nlarge part on our capacity to invest in and\nbuild the technology platforms that can enable\nthem, in a cost effective and timely manner.\nSee \u201c We face intense competition in all of\nour markets \u201d and \u201c We face risks related to\nour operational, technological and\norganizational infrastructure. \u201d\n\nSome of our competitors are substantially\nlarger than we are, which may allow those\ncompetitors to invest more money into their\ntechnology infrastructure and digital\ninnovation than we do. In addition, we face\nintense competition from smaller companies\nwhich experience lower cost structures and\ndifferent regulatory requirements and scrutiny\nthan we do, and which may allow them to\ninnovate more rapidly than we can. See \u201c We\nface intense competition in all of our\nmarkets. \u201d Further, our success depends on our\nability to attract and retain strong digital\nand technology leaders, engineers and other\nspecialized personnel. The competition is\nintense, and the compensation costs continue\nto increase for such talent. If we are unable\nto attract and retain digital and technology\ntalent, our ability to offer digital products\nand services and build the necessary\ntechnology infrastructure could be negatively\naffected, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results. A failure to\nmaintain or enhance our competitive position\nwith respect to digital products and services,\nwhether because we fail to anticipate customer\nexpectations or because our technological\ndevelopments fail to perform as desired or are\nnot implemented in a timely or successful\nmanner, could negatively impact our business\nand financial results.\n                                              \n  35    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated\nbenefits of our mergers, acquisitions and\nstrategic partnerships.\nWe have engaged in merger and acquisition\nactivity and entered into strategic\npartnerships over the past several years. We\ncontinue to evaluate and anticipate engaging\nin, among other merger and acquisition\nactivity, additional strategic partnerships\nand selected acquisitions of financial\ninstitutions and other acquisition targets,\nincluding credit card and other loan\nportfolios. We may not be able to identify and\nsecure future acquisition targets on terms and\nconditions that are acceptable to us, or\nsuccessfully complete within the anticipated\ntime frame and achieve the anticipated\nbenefits of proposed mergers, acquisitions and\nstrategic partnerships, which could impair our\ngrowth.\n\nAny merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership we undertake entails certain\nrisks, which may materially and adversely\naffect our results of operations. If we\nexperience greater than anticipated costs to\nintegrate acquired businesses into our\nexisting operations, or are not able to\nachieve the anticipated benefits of any\nmerger, acquisition or strategic partnership,\nincluding cost savings and other synergies,\nour business could be negatively affected. In\naddition, it is possible that the ongoing\nintegration processes could result in the loss\nof key employees, errors or delays in systems\nimplementation, exposure to cybersecurity\nrisks associated with acquired businesses,\nexposure to additional regulatory oversight,\nthe disruption of our ongoing businesses or\ninconsistencies in standards, controls,\nprocedures and policies that adversely affect\nour ability to maintain relationships with\npartners, clients, customers, depositors and\nemployees or to achieve the anticipated\nbenefits of any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership. Integration efforts\nalso may divert management attention and\nresources. These integration matters may have\nan adverse effect on us during any transition\nperiod.\n\nIn addition, we may face the following risks\nin connection with any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership:\n\n\u2022 New Businesses and Geographic or Other\nMarkets: Our merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership activity may involve our entry\ninto new businesses and new geographic areas\nor other markets which present risks resulting\nfrom our relative inexperience in these new\nbusinesses or markets. These new businesses or\nmarkets may change the overall character of\nour consolidated portfolio of businesses and\nalter our exposure to economic and other\nexternal factors. We face the risk that we\nwill not be successful in these new businesses\nor in these new markets.\n\n\u2022 Identification and Assessment of Merger and\nAcquisition Targets and Deployment of Acquired\nAssets: We may not be able to identify,\nacquire or partner with suitable targets.\nFurther, our ability to achieve the\nanticipated benefits of any merger,\nacquisition or strategic partnership will\ndepend on our ability to assess the asset\nquality and value of the particular assets or\ninstitutions we partner with, merge with or\nacquire. We may be unable to profitably deploy\nany assets we acquire.\n\n\u2022 Accuracy of Assumptions: In connection with\nany merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership, we may make certain assumptions\nrelating to the proposed merger, acquisition\nor strategic partnership that may be, or may\nprove to be, inaccurate, including as a result\nof the failure to realize the expected\nbenefits of any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership. The inaccuracy of any\nassumptions we may make could result in\nunanticipated consequences that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of\noperations or financial condition.\n\n\u2022 Target-specific Risk: Assets and companies\nthat we acquire, or companies that we enter\ninto strategic partnerships with, will have\ntheir own risks that are specific to a\nparticular asset or company. These risks\ninclude, but are not limited to, particular or\nspecific regulatory, accounting, operational,\nreputational and industry risks, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nFor example, we may face challenges associated\nwith integrating other companies due to\ndifferences in corporate culture, compliance\nsystems or standards of conduct.\nIndemnification rights, if any, may be\ninsufficient to compensate us for any losses\nor damages resulting from such risks. In\naddition to regulatory approvals discussed\nbelow, certain of our merger, acquisition or\npartnership activity may require third-party\nconsents in order for us to fully realize the\nanticipated benefits of any such transaction.\n\n\u2022 Conditions to Regulatory Approval: Certain\nacquisitions may not be consummated without\nobtaining approvals from one or more of our\nregulators. We cannot be certain when or if,\nor on what terms and conditions, any required\nregulatory approvals will be granted.\nConsequently, we might be required to sell\nportions of acquired assets or our own assets\nas a condition to receiving regulatory\napproval or we may not obtain regulatory\napproval for a proposed acquisition on\nacceptable terms or at all, in which case we\nwould not be able to complete the acquisition\ndespite the time and expenses invested in\npursuing it.\n                                              \n  36    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nReputational risk and social factors may\nimpact our results and damage our brand.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers is\nhighly dependent upon the perceptions of\nconsumer and commercial borrowers and deposit\nholders and other external perceptions of our\nproducts, services, trustworthiness, business\npractices, workplace culture, compliance\npractices or our financial health. In\naddition, our brand is very important to us.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand depends\nlargely on our ability to continue to provide\nhigh-quality products and services. Adverse\nperceptions regarding our reputation in the\nconsumer, commercial and funding markets could\nlead to difficulties in generating and\nmaintaining accounts as well as in financing\nthem. In particular, negative public\nperceptions regarding our reputation,\nincluding negative perceptions regarding our\nability to maintain the security of our\ntechnology systems and protect customer data,\ncould lead to decreases in the levels of\ndeposits that consumer and commercial\ncustomers and potential customers choose to\nmaintain with us or significantly increase the\ncosts of attracting and retaining customers.\nIn addition, negative perceptions regarding\ncertain industries, partners or clients could\nalso prompt us to cease business activities\nassociated with those entities.\n\nNegative public opinion or damage to our brand\ncould also result from actual or alleged\nconduct in any number of activities or\ncircumstances, including lending practices,\nregulatory compliance, security breaches\n(including the use and protection of customer\ninformation, such as resulting from the\nCybersecurity Incident), corporate governance\nand sales and marketing, and from actions\ntaken by regulators or other persons in\nresponse to such conduct. Such conduct could\nfall short of our customers\u2019 and the public\u2019s\nheightened expectations of companies of our\nsize with rigorous data, privacy and\ncompliance practices, and could further harm\nour reputation. In addition, our cobrand and\nprivate label partners or other third parties\nwith whom we have important relationships may\ntake actions over which we have limited\ncontrol that could negatively impact\nperceptions about us or the financial services\nindustry. The proliferation of social media\nmay increase the likelihood that negative\npublic opinion from any of the events\ndiscussed above will impact our reputation and\nbusiness.\n\nIn addition, a variety of social factors may\ncause changes in borrowing activity, including\ncredit card use, payment patterns and the rate\nof defaults by account holders and borrowers\ndomestically and internationally. These social\nfactors include changes in consumer confidence\nlevels, the public\u2019s perception regarding the\nbanking industry and consumer debt, including\ncredit card use, and changing attitudes about\nthe stigma of bankruptcy. If consumers develop\nor maintain negative attitudes about incurring\ndebt, or if consumption trends decline or if\nwe fail to maintain and enhance our brand, or\nwe incur significant expenses to do so, our\nbusiness and financial results could be\nmaterially and negatively affected.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual\nproperty, our revenue and profitability could\nbe negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect\nand enhance our intellectual property,\nincluding copyrights, trademarks, trade\nsecrets, patents and certain restrictions on\ndisclosure, solicitation and competition. We\nalso undertake other measures to control\naccess to and distribution of our other\nproprietary information. These measures may\nnot prevent misappropriation of our\nproprietary information or infringement of our\nintellectual property rights and a resulting\nloss of competitive advantage. In addition,\nour competitors or other third parties may\nfile patent applications for innovations that\nare used in our industry or allege that our\nsystems, processes or technologies infringe on\ntheir intellectual property rights. If our\ncompetitors or other third parties are\nsuccessful in obtaining such patents or\nprevail in intellectual property-related\nlitigation against us, we could lose\nsignificant revenues, incur significant\nlicense, royalty or technology development\nexpenses, or pay significant damages.\n\nOur risk management strategies may not be\nfully effective in mitigating our risk\nexposures in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk.\n\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity,\noperational and compliance risk requires,\namong other things, policies and procedures to\nproperly record and verify a large number of\ntransactions and events. See \u201cMD&A\u2014Risk\nManagement\u201d for further details. Even though\nwe continue to devote significant resources to\ndeveloping our risk management framework, our\nrisk management strategies may not be fully\neffective in identifying and mitigating our\nrisk exposure in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk, including risks\nthat are unidentified or unanticipated.\n\nSome of our methods of managing these risks\nare based upon our use of observed historical\nmarket behavior and management\u2019s judgment.\nThese methods may not accurately predict\nfuture exposures, which could be significantly\ngreater than the historical measures indicate\nand market conditions, particularly during a\nperiod of financial market stress, can involve\nunprecedented dislocations. Credit risk is\ninherent in the financial services business\nand results from, among other things,\nextending credit to customers. Our ability to\nassess the creditworthiness of our customers\nmay be impaired if the models and approaches\nwe use to select, manage and underwrite our\nconsumer and commercial customers become less\npredictive of future charge-offs due, for\nexample, to rapid changes in the economy,\nincluding rapid changes in tariff rates and\ninternational trade relations.\n                                              \n  37    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of\nrisk monitoring and risk mitigation\ntechniques, those techniques and the judgments\nthat accompany their application cannot\nanticipate every economic and financial\noutcome or the timing of such outcomes. For\nexample, our ability to implement our risk\nmanagement strategies may be hindered by\nadverse changes in the volatility or liquidity\nconditions in certain markets and as a result,\nmay limit our ability to distribute such risks\n(for instance, when we seek to syndicate\nexposure in bridge financing transactions we\nhave underwritten). We may, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course of our risk management or\ninvesting activities.\n\nFluctuations in market interest rates or\nvolatility in the capital markets could\nadversely affect our income and expense, the\nvalue of assets and obligations, our\nregulatory capital, cost of capital or\nliquidity.\n\nLike other financial institutions, our\nbusiness is sensitive to market interest rate\nmovements and the performance of the capital\nmarkets. Disruptions, uncertainty or\nvolatility across the capital markets could\nnegatively impact market liquidity and limit\nour access to the funding required to operate\nand grow our business. In addition, changes in\ninterest rates or in valuations in the debt or\nequity markets could directly impact us. For\nexample, we borrow money from other\ninstitutions and depositors, which we use to\nmake loans to customers and invest in debt\nsecurities and other interest-earning assets.\nWe earn interest on these loans and assets and\npay interest on the money we borrow from\ninstitutions and depositors. The interest\nrates that we pay on the securities we have\nissued are also influenced by, among other\nthings, applicable credit ratings from\nrecognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any\nof these credit ratings could affect our\nability to access the capital markets,\nincrease our borrowing costs and have a\nnegative impact on our results of operations.\nIncreased charge-offs, rising LIBOR or other\napplicable reference rates and other events\nmay cause our securitization transactions to\namortize earlier than scheduled, which could\naccelerate our need for additional funding\nfrom other sources. Fluctuations in interest\nrates, including changes in the relationship\nbetween short-term rates and long-term rates\nand in the relationship between our funding\nbasis rate and our lending basis rate, may\nhave negative impacts on our net interest\nincome and therefore our earnings.\n\nIn addition, interest rate fluctuations and\ncompetitor responses to those changes may\naffect the rate of customer prepayments for\nauto and other term loans and may affect the\nbalances customers carry on their credit\ncards. For example, increases in interest\nrates increase debt service requirements for\nsome of our borrowers, which may adversely\naffect those borrowers\u2019 ability to pay as\ncontractually obligated. This could result in\nadditional delinquencies or charge-offs and\nnegatively impact our results of operations.\nThese changes can reduce the overall yield on\nour interest-earning asset portfolio. Changes\nin interest rates and competitor responses to\nthese changes may also impact customer\ndecisions to maintain balances in the deposit\naccounts they have with us. An inability to\nattract or maintain deposits could materially\naffect our ability to fund our business and\nour liquidity position. Many other financial\ninstitutions have increased their reliance on\ndeposit funding and, as such, we expect\ncontinued competition in the deposit markets.\nWe cannot predict how this competition will\naffect our costs. If we are required to offer\nhigher interest rates to attract or maintain\ndeposits, our funding costs will be adversely\nimpacted. Changes in valuations in the debt\nand equity markets could have a negative\nimpact on the assets we hold in our investment\nportfolio. Such market changes could also have\na negative impact on the valuation of assets\nfor which we provide servicing.\n\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating\nthe effect on our earnings, economic value and\ncapital under various scenarios that differ\nbased on assumptions about the direction and\nthe magnitude of interest rate changes. We\ntake risk mitigation actions based on those\nassessments. We face the risk that changes in\ninterest rates could materially reduce our net\ninterest income and our earnings, especially\nif actual conditions turn out to be materially\ndifferent than those we assumed. See\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d for additional\ninformation.\nUncertainty regarding, and transition away\nfrom, LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.K. FCA, which regulates LIBOR, has\nannounced that it will no longer compel banks\nto contribute data for the calculation of\nLIBOR after December 31, 2021. It is likely\nthat banks will no longer continue to\ncontribute submissions for the calculation of\nLIBOR after that date, which creates\nsignificant uncertainty around the publication\nof LIBOR beyond 2021 and whether LIBOR will\ncontinue to be viewed as a reliable market\nbenchmark. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark\nAdministration (IBA), the administrator of\nLIBOR, announced that it will consult on its\nintention to cease publication of the 1-week\nand 2-month USD LIBOR settings immediately\nfollowing the LIBOR publication on December\n31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors\n(Overnight, 1, 3, 6, and 12 Months)\nimmediately following the LIBOR publication on\nJune 30, 2023. The consultation closed on\nJanuary 25, 2021 and we will continue to\nengage with industry experts to better\nunderstand the proposed IBA's extension\nannouncement and its impact on the markets and\nour transition plans. It remains unclear what\nrate or rates may develop as accepted\nalternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of\nsuch changes will be on the markets for LIBOR-\nbased financial instruments. The Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) has been\nrecommended by the Alternative\n                                              \n  38    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nReference Rates Committee as an alternative\nfor USD LIBOR, but issues and uncertainty\nremain with respect to its implementation.\n\nGiven LIBOR\u2019s extensive use across financial\nmarkets, the transition away from LIBOR\npresents several risks and challenges to the\nfinancial markets and financial institutions,\nincluding Capital One. We have loans,\nderivative contracts, unsecured debt,\nsecuritizations, vendor agreements and other\ninstruments with attributes that are either\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.\nUncertainty as to the nature of potential\nchanges, alternative reference rates such as\nSOFR, or other reforms may adversely affect\nmarket liquidity, the pricing of LIBOR-based\ninstruments, and the availability and cost of\nassociated hedging instruments and borrowings.\nIf SOFR or another rate does not achieve wide\nacceptance as the alternative to LIBOR, there\nlikely will be disruption to the markets\nrelying on the availability of a broadly\naccepted reference rate. In addition,\nuncertainty regarding LIBOR could result in\nloss of market share in certain products,\nadverse tax or accounting impacts, compliance,\nlegal or operational costs and risks\nassociated with client disclosures, as well as\nsystems disruption, model disruption and other\nbusiness continuity issues for us.\n\nEven if SOFR or another reference rate becomes\na widely acceptable replacement for LIBOR,\nrisks will remain for us with respect to\noutstanding instruments which rely on LIBOR.\nThose risks arise in connection with\ntransitioning such instruments to a new\nreference rate, the taking of discretionary\nactions or the negotiation of fallback\nprovisions and final amendments to existing\nLIBOR based agreements. Payments under\ncontracts referencing new reference rates may\nsignificantly differ from those referencing\nLIBOR. For some instruments, the method of\ntransitioning to a new reference rate may be\nchallenging, especially if parties to an\ninstrument cannot agree as to how to effect\nthat transition. If a contract is not\ntransitioned to a new reference rate and LIBOR\nceases to exist, the impact on our obligations\nis likely to vary by contract. In addition,\nprior to LIBOR cessation, instruments that\ncontinue to refer to LIBOR may be impacted if\nthere is a change in the availability or\ncalculation of LIBOR. The transition from\nLIBOR to an alternative reference rate may\nchange our market risk profile and require\nchanges to risk and pricing models, valuation\ntools, product design, information technology\nsystems, reporting infrastructure, operational\nprocesses and controls, and hedging\nstrategies. In many cases, we may be dependent\non third parties to upgrade systems, software\nand other critical functions that could\nmaterially disrupt our readiness if they are\nnot done on a timely basis or otherwise fail.\nOur assessment of the ultimate impact of, and\nour planning for, the transition from LIBOR\nremains ongoing. Failure to adequately manage\nthe transition could have a material adverse\neffect on our reputation, business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. See\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d for additional\ninformation.\nOur business could be negatively affected if\nwe are unable to attract, retain and motivate\nskilled employees.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our\nability to retain key senior leaders and to\nattract and retain skilled employees,\nparticularly employees with advanced expertise\nin credit, risk, digital and technology\nskills. We depend on our senior leaders and\nskilled employees to oversee simultaneous,\ntransformative initiatives across the\nenterprise and execute on our business plans\nin an efficient and effective manner.\nCompetition for such senior leaders and\nemployees, and the costs associated with\nattracting and retaining them, is high. Our\nability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees also is affected by perceptions of\nour culture and management, our profile in the\nregions where we have offices and the\nprofessional opportunities we offer.\nRegulation or regulatory guidance restricting\nexecutive compensation, as well as evolving\ninvestor expectations, may limit the types of\ncompensation arrangements that we may enter\ninto with our most senior leaders and could\nhave a negative impact on our ability to\nattract, retain and motivate such leaders in\nsupport of our long-term strategy. These laws\nand regulations may not apply in the same\nmanner to all financial institutions, and we\ntherefore may face more restrictions than\nother institutions and companies with which we\ncompete for talent. These laws and regulations\nmay also hinder our ability to compete for\ntalent with other industries. We rely upon our\nsenior leaders not only for business success,\nbut also to lead with integrity. To the extent\nour senior leaders behave in a manner that\ndoes not comport with our values, the\nconsequences to our brand and reputation could\nbe severe and could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, develop and\nretain talented senior leadership and\nemployees, or to implement appropriate\nsuccession plans for our senior leadership,\nour business could be negatively affected.\nWe face risks from unpredictable catastrophic\nevents.\nDespite the business contingency plans we have\nin place, such plans do not fully mitigate all\npotential business continuity risks to us.\nNatural disasters and other catastrophic\nevents could harm our business and\ninfrastructure, including our information\ntechnology systems and third-party platforms.\nOur ability to conduct business may be\nadversely affected by a disruption in the\ninfrastructure that supports our business and\nthe communities where we are located, which\nare concentrated in the Northern Virginia and\nNew York metropolitan areas, as well as\nRichmond, Virginia and Plano, Texas. This may\ninclude a disruption involving damage or loss\nof access to a physical site, cyber incidents,\nterrorist activities, the occurrence or\nworsening of disease\n                                              \n  39    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\noutbreaks or pandemics (including the COVID-19\npandemic), natural disasters, extreme weather\nevents, electrical outage, environmental\nhazard, technological infrastructure,\ncommunications or other services we use, our\nemployees or third parties with whom we\nconduct business. Our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations may be\nimpacted by any such disruption and our\nability to implement corresponding response\nmeasures, including, for example, our ability\nto adapt to a remote work environment as a\nresult of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and\nrelated response measures. In addition, if a\nnatural disaster or other catastrophic event\noccurs in certain regions where our business\nand customers are concentrated, such as the\nmid-Atlantic, New York or Texas metropolitan\nareas, we could be disproportionately impacted\nas compared to our competitors. The impact of\nsuch events and other catastrophes on the\noverall economy may also adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks from the use of or changes to\nassumptions or estimates in our financial\nstatements.\nPursuant to generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we are\nrequired to use certain assumptions and\nestimates in preparing our financial\nstatements, including determining our\nallowance for credit losses, the fair value of\ncertain assets and liabilities, and asset\nimpairment, among other items. In addition,\nthe FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies\nmay change the financial accounting and\nreporting standards, including those related\nto assumptions and estimates we use to prepare\nour financial statements, in ways that we\ncannot predict and that could impact our\nfinancial statements. If actual results differ\nfrom the assumptions or estimates underlying\nour financial statements or if financial\naccounting and reporting standards are\nchanged, we may experience unexpected material\nlosses. For a discussion of our use of\nestimates in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements, see\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Critical Accounting Policies and\nEstimates\u201d and \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies.\u201d\n\nLimitations on our ability to receive\ndividends from our subsidiaries could affect\nour liquidity and ability to pay dividends and\nrepurchase common stock.\n\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity\nfrom our subsidiaries, including the Banks.\nDividends to us from our direct and indirect\nsubsidiaries, including the Banks, have\nrepresented a major source of funds for us to\npay dividends on our common and preferred\nstock, repurchase common stock, make payments\non corporate debt securities and meet other\nobligations. There are various federal law\nlimitations on the extent to which the Banks\ncan finance or otherwise supply funds to us\nthrough dividends and loans. These limitations\ninclude minimum regulatory capital\nrequirements, federal banking law requirements\nconcerning the payment of dividends out of net\nprofits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of\nthe Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W\ngoverning transactions between an insured\ndepository institution and its affiliates, as\nwell as general federal regulatory oversight\nto prevent unsafe or unsound practices. If our\nsubsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not sufficient to\nmake dividend payments to us while maintaining\nadequate capital levels, our liquidity may be\naffected and we may not be able to make\ndividend payments to our common or preferred\nstockholders, repurchase our common stock,\nmake payments on outstanding corporate debt\nsecurities or meet other obligations, each and\nany of which could have a material adverse\nimpact on our results of operations, financial\nposition or perception of financial health.\nSee \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u201d for additional information\nregarding dividend limitations applicable to\nus and the Banks.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions\nand other third parties could adversely affect\nus.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and\nother transactions could be adversely affected\nby the stability and actions of other\nfinancial services institutions. Financial\nservices institutions are interrelated as a\nresult of trading, clearing, servicing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. We have\nexposure to financial institutions,\nintermediaries and counterparties that are\nexposed to risks over which we have little or\nno control.\n\nIn addition, we routinely execute transactions\nwith counterparties in the financial services\nindustry, including brokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds and other institutional clients,\nresulting in a significant credit\nconcentration with respect to the financial\nservices industry overall. As a result,\ndefaults by, or even rumors or questions\nabout, one or more financial services\ninstitutions, or the financial services\nindustry generally, have led to market-wide\nliquidity problems and could lead to losses or\ndefaults by us or by other institutions.\n\nLikewise, adverse developments affecting the\noverall strength and soundness of our\ncompetitors, the financial services industry\nas a whole and the general economic climate or\nsovereign debt could have a negative impact on\nperceptions about the strength and soundness\nof our business even if we are not subject to\nthe same adverse developments. In addition,\nadverse developments with respect to third\nparties with whom we have important\nrelationships also could negatively impact\nperceptions about us.

The provision for credit losses\nas a percentage of net interest income was\n44.8%, 26.7% and 25.6% in 2020 , 2019 and 2018\n, respectively.\n\nOur provision for credit losses increased by\n$4.0 billion to $10.3 billion in 2020 compared\nto 2019 primarily driven by allowance builds\nin the first and second quarters of 2020 due\nto expectations of economic worsening as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe provide additional information on the\nprovision for credit losses and changes in the\nallowance for credit losses within\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Credit Risk Profile\u201d and \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments.\u201d For information\non the allowance methodology for each of our\nloan categories, see \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies.\u201d\n                                              \n  53    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Non-Interest Expense                        \n                                              \nTable 4 displays the components of non-\ninterest expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n                                              \n  Table 4: Non-Interest Expense               \n                                              \n                                              \n         Year                                 \n  (D\u2026    End\u2026                                 \n  in     Dec\u2026                                 \n  mi\u2026    31,        20\u2026       2019       20\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Sa\u2026                                         \n  and            $  6,\u2026    $  6,3\u2026    $  5,\u2026  \n  as\u2026                                         \n  be\u2026                                         \n  Oc\u2026                                         \n  and               2,\u2026       2,0\u2026       2,\u2026  \n  eq\u2026                                         \n  Ma\u2026               1,\u2026       2,2\u2026       2,\u2026  \n  Pr\u2026               1,\u2026       1,2\u2026       1,\u2026  \n  se\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026                                         \n  and               1,\u2026       1,2\u2026       1,\u2026  \n  da\u2026                                         \n  pr\u2026                                         \n  Am\u2026                                         \n  of                 60        112       174  \n  in\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026                                         \n  no\u2026                                         \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  Ba\u2026                                         \n  re\u2026                                         \n  and               267        362       490  \n  ot\u2026                                         \n  fee                                         \n  as\u2026                                         \n  Co\u2026               323        400       413  \n  Fr\u2026               261        383       364  \n  lo\u2026                                         \n  Ot\u2026               1,\u2026        939       1,\u2026  \n  To\u2026                                         \n  ot\u2026               1,\u2026       2,0\u2026       2,\u2026  \n  no\u2026                                         \n  ex\u2026                                         \n  To\u2026                                         \n  no\u2026            $  15\u2026    $  15,\u2026    $  14\u2026  \n  ex\u2026                                         \n                                              \n_________\n(1) Includes expenses of $45 million, $61\nmillion and a benefit of $15 million related\nto our deferred compensation plan in 2020,\n2019, and 2018 , respectively .

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments.

Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenue and expenses directly or\nindirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported.

Our\nfunds transfer pricing process provides a\nfunds credit for sources of funds, such as\ndeposits generated by our Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking businesses, and a charge\nfor the use of funds by each segment. The\nallocation process is unique to each business\nsegment and acquired business. We regularly\nassess the assumptions, methodologies and\nreporting classifications used for segment\nreporting, which may result in the\nimplementation of refinements or changes in\nfuture periods.\n\nWe refer to the business segment results\nderived from our internal management\naccounting and reporting process as our\n\u201cmanaged\u201d presentation, which differs in some\ncases from our reported results prepared based\non U.S. GAAP.

We provide a summary of our\nsignificant accounting policies under \u201cNote\n1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\n\nWe have identified the following accounting\nestimates as critical because they require\nsignificant judgments and assumptions about\nhighly complex and inherently uncertain\nmatters and the use of reasonably different\nestimates and assumptions could have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations\nor financial condition. Our critical\naccounting policies and estimates are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Loan loss reserves\n\n\u2022 Asset impairment\n\n\u2022 Fair value of financial instruments\n\n\u2022 Customer rewards reserve\nWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates\nand judgments on an ongoing basis and update\nthem as necessary, based on changing\nconditions.\n                                              \n  66    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Loan Loss Reserves                          \n                                              \nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the\nCECL standard and updated our critical\naccounting policy and estimate for loan loss\nreserves. We maintain an allowance for credit\nlosses that represents management\u2019s current\nestimate of expected credit losses inherent in\nour credit card, consumer banking and\ncommercial banking loans held for investment\nportfolios as of each balance sheet date. We\nalso separately reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments that are not unconditionally\ncancellable. For all such loans and unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimate of expected\ncredit losses includes a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period of one year and\nthen reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses at each relevant loss\ncomponent of the estimate. We build our\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses, which is driven\nby charge-offs, changes in the allowance for\ncredit losses and changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments. The allowance\nfor credit losses was $15.6 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020, compared to $7.2 billion as\nof December 31, 2019. In periods prior to\n2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses\nrepresented management\u2019s estimate of incurred\nloan and lease losses as fully described in\n\u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nWe have an established process, using\nanalytical tools and management judgment, to\ndetermine our allowance for credit losses.\nEstablishing the allowance on a quarterly\nbasis involves evaluating many factors\nincluding, but not limited to, historical loss\nand recovery experience, recent trends in\ndelinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings,\nthe impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of\ncollateral underlying secured loans, account\nseasoning, changes in our credit evaluation,\nunderwriting and collection management\npolicies, seasonality, credit bureau scores,\ncurrent general economic conditions, our\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\neconomic conditions, changes in the legal and\nregulatory environment and uncertainties in\nforecasting and modeling techniques used in\nestimating our allowance for credit losses.\nKey factors that have a significant impact on\nour allowance for credit losses include\nassumptions about employment levels, home\nprices and the valuation of commercial\nproperties, automobiles and other collateral.\n\nWe have a governance framework intended to\nensure that our estimate of the allowance for\ncredit losses is appropriate. Our governance\nframework provides for oversight of methods,\nmodels, qualitative adjustments, process\ncontrols and results. At least quarterly,\nrepresentatives from the Finance and Risk\nManagement organizations review and assess our\nallowance methodologies, key assumptions and\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nGroups independent of our estimation functions\nparticipate in the review and validation\nprocess. Tasks performed by these groups\ninclude periodic review of the rationale for\nand quantification of inputs requiring\njudgment as well as adjustments to results.\n\nWe have a model policy, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which governs\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for estimating\ncredit losses. The Model Risk Office validates\nall models and requires ongoing monitoring of\ntheir performance.\n\nIn addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses, on a quarterly basis, we review and\nassess our estimate of expected losses related\nto unfunded lending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. The factors\nimpacting our assessment generally align with\nthose considered in our evaluation of the\nallowance for credit losses for the Commercial\nBanking business. Changes to the reserve for\nlosses on unfunded lending commitments are\nrecorded through the provision for credit\nlosses in the consolidated statements of\nincome and to other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n\nAlthough we examine a variety of externally\navailable data, as well as our internal loan\nperformance data, to determine our allowance\nfor credit losses and reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimation process is\nsubject to risks and uncertainties, including\na reliance on historical loss and trend\ninformation that may not be representative of\ncurrent conditions and indicative of future\nperformance as well as economic forecasts that\nmay not align with actual future economic\nconditions. Accordingly, our actual credit\nloss experience may not be in line with our\nexpectations. We provide additional\ninformation on the methodologies and key\nassumptions used in determining our allowance\nfor credit losses for each of our loan\nportfolio segments in \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies.\u201d We provide\ninformation on the components of our\nallowance, disaggregated by impairment\nmethodology, and changes in our allowance in\n\u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and\nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.\u201d\n                                              \n  Finance Charge and Fee Reserves             \n                                              \nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare recorded in revenue when earned. Billed\nfinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare included in loans held for investment\nwhile unbilled finance charges and fees are\nincluded in interest receivable.\n                                              \n  67    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe continue to accrue finance charges and fees\non credit card loans until the account is\ncharged off. We estimate the uncollectible\nportion of finance charges and fees in our\nfinance charge and fee reserve. Billed finance\ncharges and fees that are ultimately charged-\noff as uncollectible are reflected as a\nreduction to revenue.\n\nConcurrent with our adoption of the CECL\nstandard in the first quarter of 2020, we\nreclassified our finance charge and fee\nreserve of $462 million to our allowance for\ncredit losses, with a corresponding increase\nto credit card loans held for investment. We\nreview and assess the appropriateness of our\nfinance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly\nbasis. Our methodology for estimating the\nuncollectible portion of finance charges and\nfees is consistent with the methodology we use\nto estimate the allowance for credit losses on\nthe principal portion of our credit card loan\nreceivables.\n                                              \n  Asset Impairment                            \n                                              \nIn addition to our loan portfolio, we review\nother assets for impairment on a regular basis\nin accordance with applicable accounting\nguidance. This process requires significant\nmanagement judgment and involves various\nestimates and assumptions.\n                                              \n  Goodwill                                    \n                                              \nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred, plus\nthe fair value of any non-controlling\ninterests in the acquiree, over the fair value\nof the net assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed as of the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill totaled $14.7 billion as of both\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019. We did not\nrecognize any goodwill impairment in 2020 and\n2019. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Intangible\nAssets\u201d for additional information.\n\nWe perform our goodwill impairment test\nannually on October 1 at a reporting unit\nlevel. We are also required to test goodwill\nfor impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-\nnot that an impairment may have occurred. We\nhave four reporting units: Credit Card, Auto\nFinance, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial\nBanking.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted\nAccounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No.\n2017-04, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other (Topic\n350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill\nImpairment . Under the new guidance, an\nimpairment of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is\ndetermined based on the amount by which the\nreporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its\nfair value, limited to the amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit.\n\nFor the purpose of our goodwill impairment\ntesting, we calculate the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit using an allocated capital\napproach based on each reporting unit\u2019s\nspecific regulatory capital requirements,\neconomic capital requirements and underlying\nrisks. The carrying amount for a reporting\nunit is the sum of its respective capital\nrequirements, goodwill and intangibles\nbalances. Consolidated stockholder\u2019s equity in\nexcess of the sum of all reporting unit\u2019s\ncapital requirements that is not identified\nfor future capital needs, such as dividends,\nshare buybacks or other strategic initiatives,\nis allocated to the reporting units and the\nOther category and assumed distributed to\nequity holders in future periods.\n\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit\nis a subjective process that requires the use\nof estimates and the exercise of significant\njudgment. We calculate the fair value of our\nreporting units using a discounted cash flow\n(\u201cDCF\u201d) calculation, a form of the income\napproach. This DCF calculation uses projected\ncash flows based on each reporting unit\u2019s\ninternal forecast and the perpetuity growth\nmethod to calculate terminal values. Our DCF\ncalculation requires management to make\nestimates about future loan, deposit and\nrevenue growth, as well as credit losses and\ncapital rates. These cash flows and terminal\nvalues are then discounted using discount\nrates based on our external cost of capital\nwith adjustments for the risk inherent in each\nreporting unit. Discount rates used for our\nreporting units ranged from 8.1% to 14.3%, and\nwe applied a terminal year long-term growth\nrate of 3.97% to all reporting units. The\nreasonableness of our DCF calculation is\nassessed by reference to a market-based\napproach using comparable market multiples and\nrecent market transactions where available.\nThe results of the 2020 annual impairment test\nfor the reporting units indicated that the\nestimated fair values of the Commercial\nBanking, Credit Card, Auto Finance, and Other\nConsumer Banking reporting units exceeded\ntheir carrying amounts by between 11% and\n273%.\n\nAssumptions used in estimating the fair value\nof a reporting unit are judgmental and\ninherently uncertain. A change in the economic\nconditions of a reporting unit, such as\ndeclines in business performance from industry\nor macroeconomic trends or from changes in our\nstrategy, adverse impacts to loan or deposit\ngrowth trends, decreases in revenue, increases\nin expenses, increases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital requirements,\ndeterioration of market conditions, declines\nin long-term growth expectations, adverse\nimpacts of regulatory or legislative changes\nor increases in the estimated cost of capital,\nincluding if these conditions are merely\nforecasted to occur in future periods, could\ncause the estimated fair values of our\nreporting units to decline in the future, and\nincrease the risk of a goodwill impairment in\na future period.\n                                              \n  68    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Fair Value                                  \n                                              \nFair value, also referred to as an exit price,\nis defined as the price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n\nLevel 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices\n(unadjusted) in active markets for identical\nassets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Valuation is based on observable\nmarket-based inputs other than Level 1 prices,\nsuch as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active, or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially the\nfull term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3: Valuation is generated from\ntechniques that use significant assumptions\nnot observable in the market. Valuation\ntechniques include pricing models, discounted\ncash flow methodologies or similar techniques.\n\nThe degree of management judgment involved in\ndetermining the fair value of a financial\ninstrument is dependent upon the availability\nof quoted prices in active markets or\nobservable market parameters. When quoted\nprices and observable data in active markets\nare not fully available, management judgment\nis necessary to estimate fair value. Changes\nin market conditions, such as reduced\nliquidity in the capital markets or changes in\nsecondary market activities, may reduce the\navailability and reliability of quoted prices\nor observable data used to determine fair\nvalue.\n\nWe have developed policies and procedures to\ndetermine when markets for our financial\nassets and liabilities are inactive if the\nlevel and volume of activity has declined\nsignificantly relative to normal conditions.\nIf markets are determined to be inactive, it\nmay be appropriate to adjust price quotes\nreceived. When significant adjustments are\nrequired to price quotes or inputs, it may be\nappropriate to utilize an estimate based\nprimarily on unobservable inputs.\n\nSignificant judgment may be required to\ndetermine whether certain financial\ninstruments measured at fair value are\nclassified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making\nthis determination, we consider all available\ninformation that market participants use to\nmeasure the fair value of the financial\ninstrument, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused. Based upon the specific facts and\ncircumstances of each instrument or instrument\ncategory, judgments are made regarding the\nsignificance of the Level 3 inputs to the\ninstruments\u2019 fair value measurement in its\nentirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. We\ndiscuss changes in the valuation inputs and\nassumptions used in determining the fair value\nof our financial instruments, including the\nextent to which we have relied on significant\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value and\nour process for corroborating these inputs, in\n\u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value Measurement.\u201d\n\nWe have a governance framework and a number of\nkey controls that are intended to ensure that\nour fair value measurements are appropriate\nand reliable. Our governance framework\nprovides for independent oversight and\nsegregation of duties. Our control processes\ninclude review and approval of new transaction\ntypes, price verification, and review of\nvaluation judgments, methods, models, process\ncontrols and results.\n\nGroups independent of our trading and\ninvesting functions participate in the review\nand validation process. Tasks performed by\nthese groups include periodic verification of\nfair value measurements to determine if\nassigned fair values are reasonable, including\ncomparing prices from vendor pricing services\nto other available market information.\n\nOur Fair Value Committee (\u201cFVC\u201d), which\nincludes representation from business areas,\nRisk Management and Finance, provides guidance\nand oversight to ensure an appropriate\nvaluation control environment. The FVC\nregularly reviews and approves our fair\nvaluations to ensure that our valuation\npractices are consistent with industry\nstandards and adhere to regulatory and\naccounting guidance.\n\nWe have a model policy, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which governs\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for pricing and fair\nvalue measurements. The Model Risk Office\nvalidates all models and requires ongoing\nmonitoring of their performance.\n                                              \n  69    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe fair value governance process is set up in\na manner that allows the Chairperson of the\nFVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot\nbe resolved by the FVC to a more senior\ncommittee called the Valuations Advisory\nCommittee (\u201cVAC\u201d) for resolution. The VAC is\nchaired by the Chief Financial Officer and\nincludes other members of senior management.\nThe VAC convenes to review escalated valuation\ndisputes. There were no disputes for the years\nended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n                                              \n  Customer Rewards Reserve                    \n                                              \nWe offer products, primarily credit cards,\nwhich include programs that allow members to\nearn rewards based on account activity that\ncan be redeemed for cash (primarily in the\nform of statement credits), gift cards,\ntravel, or covering eligible charges. The\namount of rewards that a customer earns varies\nbased on the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program and product. The majority of\nour rewards do not expire and there is no\nlimit on the amount of rewards an eligible\ncard member can earn. Customer rewards costs,\nwhich we generally record as an offset to\ninterchange income, are driven by various\nfactors such as card member purchase volume,\nthe terms and conditions of the rewards\nprogram and rewards redemption cost. We\nestablish a customer rewards reserve that\nreflects management\u2019s judgment regarding\nrewards earned that are expected to be\nredeemed and the estimated redemption cost.\n\nWe use financial models to estimate ultimate\nredemption rates of rewards earned to date by\ncurrent card members based on historical\nredemption trends, current enrollee redemption\nbehavior, card product type, year of program\nenrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend\nlevels. Our current assumption is that the\nvast majority of all rewards earned will\neventually be redeemed. We use the weighted-\naverage redemption cost during the previous\ntwelve months, adjusted as appropriate for\nrecent changes in redemption costs, including\nchanges related to the mix of rewards\nredeemed, to estimate future redemption costs.\nWe continually evaluate our reserve and\nassumptions based on developments in\nredemption patterns, changes to the terms and\nconditions of the rewards program and other\nfactors. We recognized customer rewards\nexpense of $4.9 billion in both 2020 and 2019\nand $4.4 billion in 2018. Our customer rewards\nreserve, which is included in other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets, totaled $5.4 billion and $4.7 billion\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n                                       \n  ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS  \n                                       \nAccounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as\nof December 31, 2020\n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                                We adopted    \n                                this          \n                                guidance in   \n  Income Tax                    the first     \n  Accounting                    quarter of    \n  Simplifica\u2026                   2021 using    \n  ASU No.                       the modified  \n  2019-12,       Simplifies     retrospecti\u2026  \n  Income         various        and           \n  Taxes          aspects of     prospective   \n  (Topic         the            methods of    \n  740):Simpl\u2026    guidance on    adoption.     \n  the            accounting     Our adoption  \n  Accounting     for income     of this       \n  for Income     taxes.         standard did  \n  Taxes                         not have a    \n  Issued                        material      \n  December                      impact on     \n  2019                          our           \n                                consolidated  \n                                financial     \n                                statements.   \n                                              \nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d for information on the accounting\nstandards we adopted in 2020.\n                      \n  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  \n                      \nThe level and composition of our capital are\ndetermined by multiple factors, including our\nconsolidated regulatory capital requirements\nand internal risk-based capital assessments\nsuch as internal stress testing and economic\ncapital. The level and composition of our\ncapital may also be influenced by rating\nagency guidelines, subsidiary capital\nrequirements, business environment, conditions\nin the financial markets and assessments of\npotential future losses due to adverse changes\nin our business and market environments.\n                                              \n  Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective     \n  Action                                      \n                                              \nThe Company and the Banks are subject to the\nBasel III Capital Rules established by the\nFederal Reserve and the OCC respectively. The\nBasel III Capital Rules implement certain\ncapital and liquidity requirements published\nby the Basel Committee, along with certain\nDodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions.\nMoreover, the Banks, as insured depository\ninstitutions, are subject to PCA capital\nregulations.\n                                              \n  70    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Basel III and United States Capital Rules   \n                                              \nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%,\na Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a Total\ncapital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in\nrelation to risk-weighted assets. In addition,\nwe must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of\n4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage\nratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the\ncapital conservation buffer and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirements,\nas described below.\n\nIn July 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies\nissued the Capital Simplification Rule, which\nfinalized certain changes to the Basel III\nCapital Rules for institutions not subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches. These\nchanges, effective January 1, 2020, generally\nraised the threshold above which a covered\ninstitution such as the Company must deduct\ncertain assets from its CET1 capital,\nincluding certain deferred tax assets,\nmortgage servicing assets, and investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions.\n\nIn October 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies\nfinalized the Tailoring Rules, which amended\nthe Basel III Capital Rules to provide for\ntailored application of certain capital\nrequirements across different categories of\nbanking institutions. These categories are\ndetermined primarily by an institution\u2019s asset\nsize, with adjustments to a more stringent\ncategory possible if the institution exceeds\ncertain risk-based thresholds. As a BHC with\ntotal consolidated assets of at least $250\nbillion that does not exceed any of the\napplicable risk-based thresholds, we are a\nCategory III institution under the Tailoring\nRules. Therefore, effective January 1, 2020,\nwe are no longer subject to the Basel III\n\u201cAdvanced Approaches\u201d framework and certain\nassociated capital requirements, such as the\nrequirement to include certain elements of\nAOCI in our regulatory capital. We remain\nsubject to the countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement (which is currently set at 0%) and\nsupplementary leverage ratio requirement,\nwhich were previously required only for Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches institutions.\nEffective as of the first quarter of 2020, we\nexcluded certain elements of AOCI from our\nregulatory capital as permitted by the\nTailoring Rules. The Tailoring Rules and\nCapital Simplification Rule have, taken\ntogether, decreased our capital requirements.\n\nG-SIBs that are based in the U.S. are subject\nto an additional CET1 capital requirement\nknown as the G-SIB Surcharge. We are not a\nG-SIB based on the most recent available data\nand thus we are not subject to a G-SIB\nSurcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. The\ncapital conservation buffer for BHCs was\npreviously fixed at 2.5%. In March 2020, the\nFederal Reserve issued a final rule to\nimplement the stress capital buffer\nrequirement. The stress capital buffer\nrequirement is institution-specific and\nreplaces the fixed 2.5% capital conservation\nbuffer for BHCs.\n\nPursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule,\nthe Federal Reserve will use the results of\nits supervisory stress test to determine the\nsize of a BHC\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement. In particular, a BHC\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement will equal, subject\nto a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the\ndifference between the BHC\u2019s starting CET1\ncapital ratio and its lowest projected CET1\ncapital ratio under the severely adverse\nscenario of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory\nstress test plus (ii) the ratio of the BHC\u2019s\nprojected four quarters of common stock\ndividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters\nof the planning horizon) to the projected\nrisk-weighted assets for the quarter in which\nthe BHC\u2019s projected CET1 capital ratio reaches\nits minimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nUnder the Stress Capital Buffer Rule\nframework, the Company\u2019s new \u201cstandardized\napproach capital conservation buffer\u201d includes\nits stress capital buffer requirement (which\nwill be recalibrated every year based on the\nCompany\u2019s supervisory stress test results),\nany G-SIB surcharge (which is not applicable\nto us) and the countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement (which is currently set at 0%).\nAny determination to increase the\ncountercyclical capital buffer generally would\nbe effective twelve months after the\nannouncement of such an increase, unless the\nFederal Banking Agencies set an earlier\neffective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is 5.6% for the period from\nOctober 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, at\nwhich point a revised stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be applicable to the Company\nbased on the Company\u2019s 2021 stress testing\nresults. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum\ncapital requirements plus the standardized\napproach capital conservation buffer for CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital and total capital\nratios under the stress capital buffer\nframework are 10.1%, 11.6% and 13.6%,\nrespectively, for the period from October 1,\n2020 through September 30, 2021.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Banks. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, each Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios remain at 7.0%, 8.5% and\n10.5% respectively.\n                                              \n  71    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nIf we fail to maintain our capital ratios\nabove the minimum capital requirements plus\nthe applicable buffer requirements, we will\nface increasingly strict automatic limitations\non capital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, each of the Company and the\nBanks exceeded the minimum capital\nrequirements and the buffer requirements\napplicable to them, and each of the Banks was\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d under PCA requirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe Market Risk Rule requires institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading portfolios. As of December 31,\n2020, the Company and CONA are subject to the\nMarket Risk Rule. See \u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk\nProfile\u201d below for additional information.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nAs part of their response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted\nthe 2020 CECL Transition Rule which provides\nbanking institutions an optional five-year\ntransition period to phase in the impact of\nthe CECL standard on their regulatory capital.\n\nPursuant to the 2020 CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution may elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies use a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions are permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. Beginning January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year.

These exclusions became\neffective on April 1, 2020, and will remain in\neffect through March 31, 2021.\n\nSubsequently, in May 2020, the Federal Banking\nAgencies issued an interim final rule that\nprovides an option for depository institutions\nto make similar exclusions to the calculation\nof the supplementary leverage ratio.

In light of the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Reserve required all\nparticipating BHCs, including us, to update\nand resubmit their capital plans in the fourth\nquarter of 2020, and to preserve capital by\nsuspending share repurchases and capping\ncommon stock dividend payments for the third\nand fourth quarters of 2020 to the lower of\n(i) the amount paid in the second quarter of\n2020 and (ii) an amount equal to the average\nnet income earned across the four preceding\ncalendar quarters. Scheduled payments on\nadditional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital\ninstruments, such as preferred stock and\nsubordinated debt, were not similarly\nrestricted.\n\nWe conducted a second round of stress tests\nand submitted our updated capital plan to the\nFederal Reserve on November 2, 2020. On\nDecember 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nreleased the results of its second round of\nsupervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve\ndid not recalculate our stress capital buffer\nrequirement at this time but reserved its\nability to do so until March 31, 2021.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve extended the\ncapital distribution restrictions for all\nparticipating BHCs through at least the first\nquarter of 2021 with certain modifications. In\nparticular, for the first quarter of 2021,\nparticipating BHCs may resume share\nrepurchases but the aggregate amount of common\nstock dividend payments and share repurchases\nshall not exceed an amount equal to the\naverage net income earned across the four\npreceding calendar quarters. In addition,\ncommon stock dividend payments for the first\nquarter of 2021 continue to be capped at the\namount paid in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nWe suspended our 2019 Stock Repurchase Program\non March 13, 2020, in response to the COVID-19\npandemic through the program\u2019s expiration at\nthe end of the second quarter of 2020. As\ndescribed above, for the third and fourth\nquarters of 2020, we were restricted from\nengaging in share repurchases. On January 25,\n2021, our Board of Directors authorized the\nrepurchase of up to $7.5 billion of shares of\nour common stock.\n                                              \n  74    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe distributed dividends of $0.40 per share on\nour common stock in the first and second\nquarters of 2020. Consistent with the Federal\nReserve\u2019s capital distribution restrictions\ndescribed above, we reduced our quarterly\ndividend on our common stock from $0.40 per\nshare to $0.10 per share for the third quarter\nof 2020. For the fourth quarter of 2020, while\nour third quarter results would have permitted\nus to increase our common stock dividend\npursuant to the Federal Reserve\u2019s limitations\ndescribed above, we maintained our quarterly\ndividend at $0.10 per share as the process\nsurrounding our resubmitted capital plan had\nnot been completed at that time.\n\nOn February 4, 2021, our Board of Directors\napproved returning our quarterly common stock\ndividend to $0.40 per share for the first\nquarter of 2021.\n\nFor the description of the regulatory capital\nplanning rules we are subject to, see \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1.

As\na BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely\ndependent upon the receipt of dividends or\nother payments from our subsidiaries. The\nBanks are subject to regulatory restrictions\nthat limit their ability to transfer funds to\nour BHC. As of December 31, 2020, funds\navailable for dividend payments from COBNA and\nCONA were $4.0 billion and $1.8 billion,\nrespectively. There can be no assurance that\nwe will declare and pay any dividends to\nstockholders.\n\nConsistent with our 2019 Stock Repurchase\nProgram which was announced on June 27, 2019,\nour Board of Directors authorized the\nrepurchase of up to $2.2 billion of shares of\ncommon stock beginning in the third quarter of\n2019 through the end of the second quarter of\n2020. During the first quarter of 2020, we\nrepurchased approximately $312 million of\nshares of our common stock under the 2019\nStock Repurchase Program before suspending\nfurther repurchases on March 13, 2020 in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic through the\nprogram's expiration at the end of the second\nquarter of 2020. As noted above, for the third\nand fourth quarters of 2020, the Federal\nReserve required all participating banking\norganizations, including us, to suspend share\nrepurchases as a measure of capital\npreservation. On January 25, 2021, our Board\nof Directors authorized the repurchase of up\nto $7.5 billion of shares of our common stock.\n\nThe timing and exact amount of any future\ncommon stock repurchases will depend on\nvarious factors, including regulatory\napproval, market conditions, opportunities for\ngrowth, our capital position and the amount of\nretained earnings. Our stock repurchase\nprogram does not include specific price\ntargets, may be executed through open market\npurchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1\nprograms, and may be suspended at any time.\nFor additional information on dividends and\nstock repurchases, see \u201cMD&A\u2014Capital\nManagement\u2014Capital Planning and Regulatory\nStress Testing\u201d and \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Dividends,\nStock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds\u201d.\n                                              \n  76    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                   \n  RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                   \n                                              \n   Risk Management Framework                  \n                                              \nOur Risk Management Framework (the\n\u201cFramework\u201d) sets consistent expectations for\nrisk management across the Company. It also\nsets expectations for our \u201cThree Lines of\nDefense\u201d model, which defines the roles,\nresponsibilities and accountabilities for\ntaking and managing risk across the Company.\nAccountability for overseeing an effective\nFramework resides with our Board of Directors\neither directly or through its committees.\n\nThe \u201cFirst Line of Defense\u201d consists of any\nline of business or function that is\naccountable for risk taking and is responsible\nfor: (i) engaging in activities designed to\ngenerate revenue or reduce expenses; (ii)\nproviding operational support or servicing to\nany business function for the delivery of\nproducts or services to customers; or (iii)\nproviding technology services in direct\nsupport of first line business areas. Each\nline of business or first line function must\nmanage the risks associated with their\nactivities, including identifying, assessing,\nmeasuring, monitoring, controlling and\nreporting the risks within its business\nactivities, consistent with the risk\nframework. The \u201cSecond Line of Defense\u201d\nconsists of two types of functions:\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d) and\nSupport Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking\nactivities and assesses risks and issues\nindependent from the first line of defense.\nSupport Functions are centers of specialized\nexpertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting,\nLegal) that provide support services to the\nCompany. The \u201cThird Line of Defense\u201d is\ncomprised of the Internal Audit and Credit\nReview functions. The third line provides\nindependent and objective assurance to senior\nmanagement and to the Board of Directors that\nthe first and second lines of defense have\nsystems and governance processes which are\nwell-designed and working as intended, and\nthat the Framework is appropriate for our\nsize, complexity and risk profile.\n\nOur Framework consists of the following nine\nelements:\n                                              \n  Govern\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Accoun\u2026                                     \n  Strate\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Risk                                        \n  Alignm\u2026                                     \n             Assessm\u2026    Monitor\u2026    Aggreg\u2026  \n  Risk       Measure\u2026    and         Report\u2026  \n  Identi\u2026    and         Testing     and      \n             Response                Escala\u2026  \n  Capital                                     \n  and                                         \n  Liquid\u2026                                     \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Stress                                      \n  Testin\u2026                                     \n  Risk                                        \n  Data                                        \n  and                                         \n  Enabli\u2026                                     \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Culture                                     \n  and                                         \n  Talent                                      \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  Governance and Accountability               \n                                              \nGovernance and accountability sets the\nfoundation for the methods for governing risk\ntaking and the interactions within and among\nour three lines of defense.\n\nWe established a risk governance structure and\naccountabilities to effectively and\nconsistently oversee the management of risks\nacross the Company.

Consequently, we\ntry to ensure our credit portfolio is\nresilient to economic downturns. Our most\nimportant tool in this endeavor is sound\nunderwriting. In unsecured consumer loan\nunderwriting, we generally assume that loans\nwill be subject to an environment in which\nlosses are higher than those prevailing at the\ntime of underwriting. In commercial\nunderwriting, we generally require strong cash\nflow, collateral, covenants, structural\nenhancements, or and guarantees. In addition\nto sound underwriting, we continually monitor\nour portfolio and take steps to collect or\nwork out distressed loans.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with\nthe Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit\nOfficers, is responsible for establishing\ncredit risk policies and procedures, including\nunderwriting and hold guidelines and credit\napproval authority, and monitoring credit\nexposure and performance of our lending\nrelated transactions. Our Consumer and\nCommercial Chief Credit Officers are\nresponsible for evaluating the risk\nimplications of credit strategy and the\noversight of credit for both the existing\nportfolio and any new credit investments. They\nalso have formal approval authority for\nvarious types and levels of credit decisions,\nincluding individual commercial loan\ntransactions. Division Presidents within each\nsegment are responsible for managing the\ncredit risk within their divisions and\nmaintaining processes to control credit risk\nand comply with credit policies and\nguidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk\nOfficer establishes policies, delegates\napproval authority and monitors performance\nfor non-loan credit exposure entered into with\nfinancial counterparties or through the\npurchase of credit sensitive securities in our\ninvestment portfolio.\n\nOur credit policies establish standards in\nfive areas: customer selection, underwriting,\nmonitoring, remediation and portfolio\nmanagement. The standards in each area provide\na framework comprising specific objectives and\ncontrol processes. These standards are\nsupported by detailed policies and procedures\nfor each component of the credit process.\nStarting with customer selection, our goal is\nto generally provide credit on terms that\ngenerate above hurdle returns. We use a number\nof quantitative and qualitative factors to\nmanage credit risk, including setting credit\nrisk limits and guidelines for each of our\nlines of business. We monitor performance\nrelative to these guidelines and report\nresults and any required mitigating actions to\nappropriate senior management committees and\nour Board of Directors.\n                                              \n   Liquidity Risk Management                  \n                                              \nWe manage liquidity risk by applying our\nLiquidity Framework. The Liquidity Framework\nuses internal and regulatory stress testing\nand the evaluation of other balance sheet\nmetrics to confirm that we maintain a\nfortified balance sheet that is resilient to\nuncertainties that may arise as a consequence\nof systemic, idiosyncratic, or combined\nliquidity events. We continuously monitor\nmarket and economic conditions to evaluate\nemerging stress conditions and to develop\nappropriate action plans in accordance with\nour Contingency Funding Plan and our Recovery\nPlan, which include the Company\u2019s policies,\nprocedures and action plans for managing\nliquidity stress events. The Liquidity\nFramework enables us to manage our liquidity\nrisk in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nAdditionally, the Liquidity Framework\nestablishes governing principles that apply to\nthe management of liquidity risk. We use these\nprinciples to monitor, measure and report\nliquidity risk; to develop funding and\ninvestment strategies that enable us to\nmaintain an adequate level of liquidity to\nsupport our businesses and satisfy regulatory\nrequirements; and to protect us from a broad\nrange of liquidity events should they arise.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with\nthe Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer,\nis responsible for the establishment of\nliquidity risk management policies and\nstandards for governance and monitoring of\nliquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess\nliquidity strength by evaluating several\ndifferent balance sheet metrics under severe\nstress scenarios to ensure we can withstand\nsignificant funding degradation through\nidiosyncratic, systemic, and combined\nliquidity stress scenarios. Management reports\nliquidity metrics to appropriate senior\nmanagement committees and our Board of\nDirectors no less than quarterly.\n\nWe seek to mitigate liquidity risk\nstrategically and tactically. From a strategic\nperspective, we have acquired and built\ndeposit gathering businesses and actively\nmonitor our funding concentration. From a\ntactical perspective, we have accumulated a\nsizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash\nand cash equivalents, high-quality,\nunencumbered securities and committed\n                                              \n  81    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ncollateralized credit lines.

Market risk\nis inherent from the financial instruments\nassociated with our business operations and\nactivities including loans, deposits,\nsecurities, short-term borrowings, long-term\ndebt and derivatives. We manage market risk\nexposure, which is principally driven by\nbalance sheet interest rate risk, centrally\nand establish quantitative risk limits to\nmonitor and control our exposure.\n\nWe recognize that interest rate and foreign\nexchange risk is present in our business due\nto the nature of our assets and liabilities.\nBanks typically manage the trade-off between\nnear-term earnings volatility and market value\nvolatility by targeting moderate levels of\neach. In addition to using industry accepted\ntechniques to analyze and measure interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk, we perform\nsensitivity analyses to identify our risk\nexposures under a broad range of scenarios.\nInvestment securities and derivatives are the\nmain levers for the management of interest\nrate risk. In addition, we also use\nderivatives to manage our foreign exchange\nrisk.\n\nThe market risk positions for the Company and\neach of the Banks are calculated separately\nand in aggregate, and analyzed against pre-\nestablished limits. Results are reported to\nthe Asset Liability Committee monthly and to\nthe Risk Committee of the Board of Directors\nno less than quarterly. Management is\nauthorized to utilize financial instruments as\noutlined in our policy to actively manage\nmarket risk exposure.\n                                              \n   Operational Risk Management                \n                                              \nWe recognize the criticality of managing\noperational risk on both a strategic and day-\nto-day basis and that there are heightened\nexpectations from our regulators and our\ncustomers. We have implemented appropriate\noperational risk management policies,\nstandards, processes and controls to enable\nthe delivery of high quality and consistent\ncustomer experiences and to achieve business\nobjectives in a controlled manner.\n\nThe Chief Operational Risk Officer is\nresponsible for establishing and overseeing\nour Operational Risk Management Program. In\naccordance with Basel III requirements, the\nprogram establishes practices for assessing\nthe operational risk profile and executing key\ncontrol processes for operational risks. These\nrisks include topics such as internal and\nexternal fraud, cyber and technology risk,\ndata management, model risk, third party\nmanagement and business continuity.\nOperational Risk Management enforces these\npractices and delivers reporting of\noperational risk results to senior business\nleaders, the executive committee and the Board\nof Directors.\n                                              \n   Reputation Risk Management                 \n                                              \nWe recognize that reputation risk is of\nparticular concern for financial institutions\nand, increasingly, technology companies, in\nthe current environment. Areas of concern have\nexpanded to include company policies,\npractices and values and, with the growing use\nof social and digital platforms, public\ncorporations face a new level of scrutiny and\nchannels for activism and advocacy. The\nheightened expectations of internal and\nexternal stakeholders have made corporate\nculture, values and conduct pressure points\nfor individuals and advocates voicing concerns\nor seeking change. We manage both strategic\nand tactical reputation issues and build our\nrelationships with government officials,\nmedia, community and consumer advocates,\ncustomers and other constituencies to help\nstrengthen the reputations of both our Company\nand industry. Our actions include implementing\npro-customer practices in our business and\nserving low to moderate income communities in\nour market area consistent with a quality bank\nand an innovative technology leader.

Our\nprimary loan products include credit cards,\nauto loans and commercial lending products. We\nsold all of our consumer home loan portfolio\nand the related servicing during 2018.\n\n\u2022 Credit cards: We originate both prime and\nsubprime credit cards through a variety of\nchannels. Our credit cards generally have\nvariable interest rates. Credit card accounts\nare primarily underwritten using an automated\nunderwriting system based on predictive models\nthat we have developed. The underwriting\ncriteria, which are customized for individual\nproducts and marketing programs, are\nestablished based on an analysis of the net\npresent value of expected revenues, expenses\nand losses, subject to further analysis using\na variety of stress conditions. Underwriting\ndecisions are generally based on credit bureau\ninformation, including payment history, debt\nburden and credit scores, such as FICO scores,\nand on other factors, such as applicant\nincome. We maintain a credit card\nsecuritization program and selectively sell\ncharged-off credit card loans.\n\n\u2022 Auto: We originate both prime and subprime\nauto loans through a network of auto dealers\nand direct marketing. Our auto loans generally\nhave fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75\nmonths or less, but can go up to 84 months.\nLoan size limits are customized by program and\nare generally less than $75,000. Similar to\ncredit card accounts, the underwriting\ncriteria are customized for individual\nproducts and marketing programs and based on\nanalysis of net present value of expected\nrevenues, expenses and losses, and are subject\nto maintaining resilience under a variety of\nstress conditions. Underwriting decisions are\ngenerally based on an applicant\u2019s income,\nestimated net disposable income, and credit\nbureau information including FICO scores,\nalong with collateral characteristics such as\nloan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratio. We maintain an\nauto securitization program.\n\n\u2022 Commercial: We offer a range of commercial\nlending products, including loans secured by\ncommercial real estate and loans to middle\nmarket commercial and industrial companies.\nOur commercial loans may have a fixed or\nvariable interest rate; however, the majority\nof our commercial loans have variable rates.\nOur underwriting standards require an analysis\nof the borrower\u2019s financial condition and\nprospects, as well as an assessment of the\nindustry in which the borrower operates. Where\nrelevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying\ncollateral and guarantees. We maintain\nunderwriting guidelines and limits for major\ntypes of borrowers and loan products that\nspecify, where applicable, guidelines for debt\nservice coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and\nstandard covenants and conditions. We assign a\nrisk rating and establish a monitoring\nschedule for loans based on the risk profile\nof the borrower, industry segment, source of\nrepayment, the underlying collateral and\nguarantees, if any, and current market\nconditions. Although we generally retain the\ncommercial loans we underwrite, we may\nsyndicate positions for risk mitigation\npurposes, including bridge financing\ntransactions we have underwritten. In\naddition, we originate and service multifamily\ncommercial real estate loans which are sold to\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises.\n                                              \n  83    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nPortfolio Composition and Maturity Profile of\nLoans Held for Investment\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for\ninvestment, including loans held in our\nconsolidated trusts, and loans held for sale.\nThe information presented in this section\nexcludes loans held for sale, which totaled\n$2.7 billion and $400 million as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 22 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n                                              \n  Table 22: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            December         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     31, 2020         31, 2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             69  %            67  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or              31               33     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             46  %            48  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660           20               20     \n  620 or              34               32     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

Our COVID-19 programs\nwere designed to be short-term accommodations\nso that we could provide our customers with\nprompt relief. Information about the customer\naccommodation programs we offered during 2020\nis below, along with the impacts of enrollment\non accrual and delinquency status.\n\nAdditional guidance issued by the Federal\nBanking Agencies and contained in the CARES\nAct provides banking organizations with TDR\nrelief for modifications of current borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nadherence with the guidance, we assessed all\nloan modifications introduced to current\nborrowers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nthrough December 31, 2020, that would have\nbeen designated as TDRs under our existing\npolicies, and followed guidance that any such\neligible loan modifications made on a\ntemporary and good faith basis are not\nconsidered TDRs. Through December 31, 2020,\napproximately 80% of enrollments in our\ncustomer accommodation programs have been for\nonly 1-2 months, which would generally not\nhave resulted in TDR classification under our\nexisting policies as the concession granted\nwas insignificant.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications, including those offered via our\nCOVID-19 programs, when estimating the credit\nquality of our loan portfolio and establishing\nallowance levels. For our Commercial Banking\ncustomers, enrollment in a customer assistance\nprogram is also considered in the assignment\nof an internal risk rating.\n                                              \n  Auto Customer Assistance Program            \n                                              \nWithin our auto business, we generally offered\ncustomers a 1-2 month payment extension, with\nan option to renew, and fee waivers. Auto\nloans enrolled in short-term payment\nextensions continue to accrue interest. The\ncontractual term of the loan is extended by\nthe length of the short-term payment extension\nand the delinquency status is updated to\nreflect the revised terms of the loan. For\ncustomers that were delinquent at the time of\nenrollment, their delinquency status is\nreduced commensurate with the length of the\nshort-term payment extension. For most of\n2020, relief was limited to a maximum of six\nmonthly payments. In December 2020, the limit\nwas reduced to a maximum of four monthly\npayments when temporary payment reduction\nprograms were made available to customers.\n\nThrough December 31, 2020, a total of 17.8% of\naccounts representing $12.3 billion of loans\noutstanding have received a short-term payment\nextension at any time through this program\n(including those who are no longer enrolled).\nApproximately 73% of these customers were\ncurrent at the time of their first enrollment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 0.6% of\naccounts, representing $437 million of loans\noutstanding, were enrolled and had been\napproved to skip their upcoming payment.\nApproximately 81% of total cumulative\nenrollments, representing $10.3 billion of\nloans outstanding, were current as of December\n31, 2020.\n                                              \n  Domestic Card Customer Assistance Program   \n                                              \nWithin our domestic credit card business,\ncustomers were offered a one-month payment\ndeferral, with the option to renew, and fee\nwaivers. Card loans enrolled in the deferral\nprogram continue to accrue interest. Their\ndelinquency status was generally frozen at the\ntime of enrollment and, upon exiting the\nprogram, resumed the delinquency status at the\ntime of enrollment.\n\nThrough December 31, 2020, excluding certain\nretail partnership portfolios, a total of 2.9%\nof active accounts representing $3.9 billion\nof loans outstanding have received a payment\ndeferral at any time through this program\n(including those who are no longer enrolled as\nof December 31, 2020). Approximately 91% of\nthese customers were current at the time of\ntheir first enrollment. As of December 31,\n2020, approximately 0.1% of active accounts,\nrepresenting $135 million of loans\noutstanding, were enrolled and had been\napproved to skip their upcoming payment.\nApproximately 83% of total cumulative\nenrollments, representing $3.1 billion of\nloans outstanding, were current as of December\n31, 2020.\n                                              \n  Temporary Payment Reduction Programs        \n                                              \nAs the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, we\nhave continued to work with customers to\nunderstand their needs. In response to those\nefforts, temporary payment reduction programs,\nranging from 6-9 months, were made available\nto auto and domestic card customers in the\nfourth quarter of 2020. As of December 31,\n2020, less than 0.1% of accounts were enrolled\nin these programs.\n                                              \n  92    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Other Customer Assistance Programs          \n                                              \nWhile the vast majority of enrollments were in\nour auto and domestic card business, hardship\naccommodations were also made available to our\ninternational credit card, small business\nbanking, and commercial banking customers. For\nour commercial banking customers, our\nofferings are more customized, but generally\ninclude short-term payment deferrals. We also\noffered PPP loans to our eligible small\nbusiness banking and commercial banking\nclients.\n                                              \n  Troubled Debt Restructurings                \n                                              \nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (three to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectability of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.\n\nTable 28 presents our amortized cost of loans\nmodified in TDRs as of December 31, 2020 and\n2019, which excludes loan modifications that\ndo not meet the definition of a TDR and loans\nthat received relief under the guidance issued\nby the Federal Banking Agencies and contained\nin the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19\npandemic.\n                                              \n  Table 28: Troubled Debt Restructurings      \n                                              \n                                              \n           De\u2026                  D\u2026            \n           31,                  3\u2026            \n           20\u2026                  2\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (\u2026               %                    %     \n  in       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026     \n                  M\u2026                  Mo\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026    $  511    2\u2026    %    $  6\u2026    38\u2026  %  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       217        10\u2026       2\u2026    12\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       728        34\u2026       8\u2026    50\u2026     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  b\u2026                                          \n  A\u2026       615    2\u2026            3\u2026    20\u2026     \n  R\u2026        18    0\u2026            24    1.5     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       633    3\u2026            3\u2026    22\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       723    3\u2026            4\u2026    27\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  2,\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    10\u2026  %  \n  S\u2026                                          \n  of                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    $  1,\u2026    8\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    81\u2026  %  \n  N\u2026       366    1\u2026            3\u2026    18\u2026     \n  T\u2026    $  2,\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    10\u2026  %  \n                                              \nIn our Credit Card business, the majority of\nour credit card loans modified in TDRs involve\nreducing the interest rate on the account and\nplacing the customer on a fixed payment plan\nnot exceeding 60 months. The effective\ninterest rate in effect immediately prior to\nthe loan modification is used as the effective\ninterest rate for purposes of measuring\nimpairment using the present value of expected\ncash flows. If the customer does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then the\ncredit card loan agreement may revert to its\noriginal payment terms, generally resulting in\nany loan outstanding reflected in the\nappropriate delinquency category and charged\noff in accordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, an interest rate reduction or\nprincipal reduction, or a combination of these\nconcessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\namortized cost.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, with a portion of these loans\nreceiving an interest rate reduction or a\ngross balance reduction. The impairment on\nmodified commercial loans is generally\ndetermined based on the underlying collateral\nvalue.\n\nWe provide additional information on modified\nloans accounted for as TDRs, including the\nperformance of those loans\n                                              \n  93    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nsubsequent to modification, in \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans.\u201d\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance.

There is no\nlimit under this shelf registration to the\namount or number of such securities that we\nmay offer and sell, subject to market\nconditions. In addition, we also maintain a\nshelf registration that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $25 billion\nof securitized debt obligations from our\ncredit card loan securitization trust and a\nshelf registration that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $20 billion\nfrom our auto loan securitization trusts.\n\nIn addition to our issuance capacity under the\nshelf registration statements, we also have\naccess to FHLB advances and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The ability to borrow\nutilizing these sources is based on membership\nstatus and the amount is dependent upon the\nBanks\u2019 ability to post collateral. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, we pledged both loans and\nsecurities to the FHLB to secure a maximum\nborrowing capacity of $19.6 billion, of which\nonly $72 million was used.

Our primary market\nrisk exposures include interest rate risk,\nforeign exchange risk and commodity pricing\nrisk. We are exposed to market risk primarily\nfrom the following operations and activities:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of deposit\ngathering and lending;\n\n\u2022 Asset/liability management activities\nincluding the management of investment\nsecurities, short-term and long-term\nborrowings and derivatives;\n\n\u2022 Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada\nwithin our Credit Card business; and\n\n\u2022 Customer accommodation activities within our\nCommercial Banking business.\n\nWe have enterprise-wide risk management\npolicies and limits, approved by our Board of\nDirectors, which govern our market risk\nmanagement activities. Our objective is to\nmanage our exposure to market risk in\naccordance with these policies and limits\nbased on prevailing market conditions and\nlong-term expectations. We provide additional\ninformation below about our primary sources of\nmarket risk, our market risk management\nstrategies and the measures that we use to\nevaluate these exposures.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Risk                          \n                                              \nInterest rate risk represents exposure to\nfinancial instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest rates. We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or re-pricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments, including\ncaps, floors, options, futures and forward\ncontracts.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact on our projected 12-month\nbaseline interest rate-sensitive revenue\nresulting from movements in interest rates.\nInterest rate-sensitive revenue consists of\nnet interest income and certain components of\nother non-interest income significantly\nimpacted by movements in interest rates,\nincluding changes in the fair value of\nfreestanding interest rate derivatives. In\naddition to our existing assets and\nliabilities, we incorporate expected future\nbusiness growth assumptions, such as loan and\ndeposit growth and pricing, and plans for\nprojected changes in our funding mix in our\nbaseline forecast. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\nprojected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we\nassume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel\nshift in the level of interest rates detailed\nin Table 37 below. At the current level of\ninterest rates, our interest rate sensitive\nrevenue is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate\nscenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward\nshocks has increased as compared to December\n31, 2019 mainly due to the decline in interest\nrates and the growth in deposits and cash.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity                    \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact on the net\npresent value of our assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivative exposures, resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Key\nassumptions used in the calculation include\nprojecting rate sensitive prepayments for\nmortgage securities, loans and other assets,\nterm structure modeling of interest rates,\ndiscount spreads, and deposit volume and\npricing assumptions. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\neconomic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n37 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity increases in higher\nrate scenarios and decreases in lower interest\nrate scenarios. Similar to the changes in net\ninterest income sensitivity, our current\neconomic value of equity sensitivity to upward\nshocks has also increased as compared to\nDecember 31, 2019 mainly due to the decline in\ninterest rates and the growth in deposits and\ncash.\n                                              \n  100    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 37 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand economic value of equity calculated under\nthe methodology described above as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019.

Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on the existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities.\u201d\n                                              \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                       \n                                              \nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to\nchanges in the values of current holdings and\nfuture cash flows denominated in other\ncurrencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nintercompany funding outstanding was 320\nmillion GBP and 761 million GBP as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 5.3\nbillion CAD and 6.6 billion CAD as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our EUR-\ndenominated borrowings outstanding were 1.3\nbillion EUR and 1.2 billion EUR as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n                                              \n  101    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet to\ntranslation risk in AOCI and our capital\nratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 1.7 billion\nGBP and 1.6 billion GBP as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively, and 1.5 billion\nCAD and 1.4 billion CAD as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ an\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal. For further information on our\nrisk related to customer accommodation\nderivatives, see \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\nTransition\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority, the regulator for the\nadministration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR\nwould be transitioned as an interest rate\nbenchmark and that it will no longer compel\nbanks to contribute LIBOR data beyond December\n31, 2021. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nestablished the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a group of private market\nparticipants and ex-officio members\nrepresenting banking and financial sector\nregulators. The ARRC has recommended SOFR as\nthe preferred alternative rate for certain\nU.S. dollar derivative and cash instruments.\nWhile the ARRC has recommended SOFR as the\nreplacement rate for LIBOR, there is\nacknowledgment that the development of a\ncredit-sensitive element could be a complement\nto SOFR. It is unclear as to the likelihood\nand timing, but such a development would have\nimpacts to our transition efforts.\n\nOn November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark\nAdministration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of\nLIBOR, announced that it will consult on its\nintention to cease publication of the 1-week\nand 2-month USD LIBOR settings immediately\nfollowing the LIBOR publication on December\n31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors\n(Overnight 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) immediately\nfollowing the LIBOR publication on June 30,\n2023. The continuation of USD LIBOR as a\nrepresentative rate into mid-2023 allows many\nlegacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature prior to\ncessation and should support customers\u2019 and\nfinancial services firms\u2019 building operational\nreadiness to support new products and\nadditional market developments.

Internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process designed by,\nor under the supervision of, the Company\u2019s\nprincipal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, and effected by the Company\u2019s Board\nof Directors, management and other personnel,\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for\nexternal reporting purposes in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nCapital One\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that the Company\u2019s receipts\nand expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the\nCompany\u2019s management and directors; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the\nCompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on its financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nManagement conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020, based on the framework in\n\u201c2013 Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework\u201d\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\n(\u201cCOSO\u201d), commonly referred to as the \u201c2013\nFramework.\u201d\n\nBased on this assessment, management concluded\nthat, as of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting was\neffective based on the criteria established by\nCOSO in the 2013 Framework. Additionally,\nbased upon management\u2019s assessment, the\nCompany determined that there were no material\nweaknesses in its internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020, has been audited by Ernst &\nYoung LLP, an independent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in their\naccompanying report, which expresses an\nunqualified opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020.\n                                              \n  /s/ RICHARD D.

Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\nare required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control\nbased on the assessed risk, and performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nOver Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                         \n  /s/\u00a0Ernst & Young LLP  \n  Tysons, Virginia       \n  February 25, 2021      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                         \n                                              \n  117    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC    \n   ACCOUNTING FIRM                            \n                                              \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors\nof Capital One Financial Corporation:\n                                              \n   Opinion on the Financial Statements        \n                                              \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of Capital One Financial\nCorporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019, the related consolidated\nstatements of income, comprehensive income,\nchanges in stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2020, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated\nfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company at December\n31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December 31,\n2020, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the\nstandards of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020, based on\ncriteria established in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) and our\nreport dated February 25, 2021 expressed an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\n                                              \n  Adoption of New Accounting Standard         \n                                              \nAs discussed in Note 1 and Note 4 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company\nchanged its method for accounting for credit\nlosses in 2020.

We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities\nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe financial statements. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\n                                              \n  Critical Audit Matters                      \n                                              \nThe critical audit matters communicated below\nare matters arising from the current period\naudit of the financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to\nthe audit committee and that: (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to\nthe financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective or complex\njudgments.

and\nheadquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) offer a broad\narray of financial products and services to\nconsumers, small businesses and commercial\nclients through digital channels, branches,\nCaf\u00e9s and other distribution channels. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, our principal subsidiaries\nincluded:\n\u2022 Capital One Bank (USA), National Association\n(\u201cCOBNA\u201d), which offers credit and debit card\nproducts, other lending products and deposit\nproducts; and\n\u2022 Capital One, National Association (\u201cCONA\u201d),\nwhich offers a broad spectrum of banking\nproducts and financial services to consumers,\nsmall businesses and commercial clients.\nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d COBNA and CONA are\ncollectively referred to as the \u201cBanks.\u201d\nWe also offer products outside of the United\nStates of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) principally through\nCapital One (Europe) plc (\u201cCOEP\u201d), an indirect\nsubsidiary of COBNA organized and located in\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), and through a\nbranch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority,\namong other things, to provide credit card\nloans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has\nthe authority to provide credit card loans.\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into threemajor\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We\nprovide details on our business segments, the\nintegration of recent acquisitions, if any,\ninto our business segments and the allocation\nmethodologies and accounting policies used to\nderive our business segment results in \u201cNote\n17\u2014Business Segments and Revenue from\nContracts with Customers.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements have been prepared in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles\nin the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of\nthe consolidated financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and in the related\ndisclosures. These estimates are based on\ninformation available as of the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements. While\nmanagement makes its best judgments, actual\namounts or results could differ from these\nestimates. Certain prior period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Capital One Financial\nCorporation and all other entities in which we\nhave a controlling financial interest. We\ndetermine whether we have a controlling\nfinancial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting\ninterest entity (\u201cVOE\u201d) or a variable interest\nentity (\u201cVIE\u201d). All significant intercompany\naccount balances and transactions have been\neliminated.\nVoting Interest Entities\nVOEs are entities that have sufficient equity\nand provide the equity investors voting rights\nthat give them the power to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations.\nSince a controlling financial interest in an\nentity is typically obtained through ownership\nof a majority voting interest, we consolidate\nour majority-owned subsidiaries and other\nvoting interest entities in which we hold,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 50% of the\nvoting rights or where we exercise control\nthrough other contractual rights.\nInvestments in which we do not hold a\ncontrolling financial interest but have\nsignificant influence over the entity\u2019s\nfinancial and operating decisions (generally\ndefined as owning a voting interest of 20% to\n50%) are accounted for under the equity\nmethod. If we own less than 20% of a voting\ninterest entity, we measure equity investments\nat fair value with changes in fair value\n                                              \n  127    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nrecorded through net income, except those that\ndo not have a readily determinable fair value\n(for which a measurement alternative is\napplied). We report equity investments in\nother assets on our consolidated balance\nsheets and include our share of income or loss\nand dividends from those investments in other\nnon-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (i)\nlack sufficient equity to permit the entity to\nfinance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other\nparties; or (ii) have equity investors that do\nnot have the ability to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations\nthrough voting rights, or do not have the\nobligation to absorb the expected losses, or\ndo not have the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The entity that is\ndeemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE is\nrequired to consolidate the VIE. An entity is\ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE\nif that entity has both (i) the power to\ndirect the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses or the right to receive benefits that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE.\nIn determining whether we are the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE, we consider both\nqualitative and quantitative factors regarding\nthe nature, size and form of our involvement\nwith the VIE, such as our role in establishing\nthe VIE and our ongoing rights and\nresponsibilities; our economic interests,\nincluding debt and equity investments,\nservicing fees and other arrangements deemed\nto be variable interests in the VIE; the\ndesign of the VIE, including the\ncapitalization structure, subordination of\ninterests, payment priority, relative share of\ninterests held across various classes within\nthe VIE\u2019s capital structure and the reasons\nwhy the interests are held by us.\nWe perform on-going reassessments to evaluate\nwhether changes in an entity\u2019s capital\nstructure or changes in the nature of our\ninvolvement with the entity result in a change\nto the VIE designation or a change to our\nconsolidation conclusion. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Variable\nInterest Entities and Securitizations\u201d for\nfurther details.\nBalance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets\nand Liabilities\nDerivative contracts that we execute\nbilaterally in the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nmarket or are centrally cleared are generally\ngoverned by enforceable master netting\narrangements where we generally have the right\nto offset exposure with the same counterparty.\nEither counterparty can generally request to\nnet settle all contracts through a single\npayment upon default on, or termination of,\nany one contract. We elect to offset the\nderivative assets and liabilities under\nnetting arrangements for balance sheet\npresentation where a right of setoff exists.\nFor derivative contracts entered into under\nmaster netting arrangements for which we have\nnot been able to confirm the enforceability of\nthe setoff rights, or those not subject to\nmaster netting arrangements, we do not offset\nour derivative positions for balance sheet\npresentation. See \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities\u201d for more\ndetails.\nWe also elect to present securities purchased\nor sold under resale or repurchase agreements\non a net basis when a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement exists and other\napplicable criteria are met. Security\ncollateral received from or pledged to the\ncounterparties are not eligible for netting\nand are presented gross in our consolidated\nbalance sheet.

The accounting\nand measurement framework for our investment\nsecurities differs depending on the security\nclassification.\nWe classify securities as available for sale\nor held to maturity based on our investment\nstrategy and management\u2019s assessment of our\nintent and ability to hold the securities\nuntil maturity. On December 31, 2019, we\ntransferred our entire portfolio of held to\nmaturity securities to available for sale. We\ndid not have any securities that were\nclassified as held to maturity as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe report securities available for sale on our\nconsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The\namortized cost of investment securities\nreflects the amount for which the security was\nacquired, adjusted for accrued interest,\namortization of premiums, discounts, and net\ndeferred fees and costs, any applicable fair\nvalue hedge accounting adjustments, collection\nof cash, and charge-offs. We elect to present\naccrued interest for securities available for\nsale within interest receivable on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains\nor losses are recorded, net of tax, as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Unamortized premiums,\ndiscounts and other basis adjustments for\navailable for sale securities are generally\nrecognized in interest income over the\ncontractual lives of the securities using the\neffective interest method. However, premiums\non certain callable investment securities are\namortized to the earliest call date. We record\npurchases and sales of investment securities\navailable for sale on a trade date basis.\nRealized gains or losses from the sale of debt\nsecurities are computed using the first-in\nfirst-out method of identification, and are\nincluded in non-interest income in our\nconsolidated statements of income. We elect to\npresent accrued interest for securities\navailable for sale within interest receivable\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nAn individual debt security is impaired when\nthe fair value of the security is less than\nits amortized cost. If we intend to sell an\navailable for sale security in an unrealized\nloss position or it is more likely than not\nthat we will be required to sell the security\nprior to recovery of its amortized cost basis,\nany allowance for credit losses is reversed\nthrough our provision for credit losses and\nthe difference between the amortized cost\nbasis of the security and its fair value is\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nFor impaired debt securities that we have both\nthe intent and ability to hold, the securities\nare evaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. The allowance for credit losses on our\ninvestment securities is recognized through\nour provision for credit losses and limited by\nthe unrealized losses of a security measured\nas the difference between the security\u2019s\namortized cost and fair value. See further\ndiscussion below under the \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses - Available for Sale Investment\nSecurities\u201d section of this Note.\nOur investment portfolio also includes certain\ndebt securities that, at the time of purchase,\nhad experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Such debt securities are\naccounted for in accordance with accounting\nguidance for purchased financial assets with\ncredit deterioration and are herein referred\nto as purchased credit-deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d)\nsecurities.\nPCD securities require the recognition of an\nallowance for credit losses at the time of\nacquisition. The allowance for credit losses\nis not recognized in provision for credit\nlosses. Instead, the purchase price and the\ninitial allowance collectively represent the\namortized cost basis of a PCD security. Any\nnon-credit discount or premium at the date of\nacquisition is amortized into interest income\nover the remaining life of the security.\nSubsequent to the date of purchase, we\nremeasure the allowance for credit losses on\nthe amortized cost basis using the same\npolicies as for other debt securities\navailable for sale and changes are recognized\nthrough our provision for credit losses. See\nfurther discussion below under the \u201cAllowance\nfor Credit Losses - Available for Sale\nInvestment Securities\u201d section of this Note.\n                                              \n  129    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWe charge off any portion of an investment\nsecurity that we determine is uncollectible.\nThe amortized cost basis, excluding accrued\ninterest, is charged off through the allowance\nfor credit losses. Accrued interest is charged\noff as a reduction to interest income.\nRecoveries of previously charged off principal\namounts are recognized in our provision for\ncredit losses when received.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Available for\nSale Investment Securities\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\n(\u201callowance\u201d) that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\nover the contractual terms of our investment\nsecurities classified as available for sale.\nWhen an investment security available for sale\nis impaired due to credit factors, we\nrecognize a provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and an\nallowance for credit losses on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Credit losses\nrecognized in the allowance for credit losses\nare limited to the amount by which the\ninvestment security\u2019s amortized cost basis\nexceeds its fair value. Investment securities\nin unrealized gain positions do not have an\nallowance for credit losses as the investment\nsecurity could be sold at its fair value to\nprevent realization of credit losses. We\nexclude accrued interest from the fair value\nand amortized cost basis of an investment\nsecurity for purposes of measuring impairment.\nCharge-offs of uncollectible amounts of\ninvestment securities are deducted from the\nallowance for credit losses.\nFor certain of our securities available for\nsale, we have determined that there is no risk\nof impairment due to credit factors. These\ninvestment securities include high quality\ndebt instruments that are issued and\nguaranteed by the United States government and\nits agencies or are issued through certain\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises. Management\nperforms periodic assessments to reevaluate\nthis conclusion by considering any changes in\nhistorical losses, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\nWe evaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at\nthe individual security level and determine\nwhether any portion of the decline in fair\nvalue is due to a credit loss. We make this\ndetermination through the use of quantitative\nand qualitative analyses. Our qualitative\nanalysis includes factors such as the extent\nto which fair value is less than amortized\ncost, any changes in the security\u2019s credit\nrating, past defaults or delayed payments, and\nadverse conditions impacting the security or\nissuer. A credit loss exists to the extent\nthat management does not expect to recover the\namortized cost basis.\nFor investment securities which require\nfurther assessment, we perform a quantitative\nanalysis using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology and compare the present value of\nexpected future cash flows from the security\navailable for sale to the security\u2019s amortized\ncost basis. Projected future cash flows\nreflect management\u2019s best estimate and are\nbased on our understanding of past events,\ncurrent conditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts, and are discounted by the\nsecurity\u2019s effective interest rate adjusted\nfor prepayments. The allowance for credit\nlosses for investment securities reflects the\ndifference by which the amortized cost basis\nexceeds the present value of future cash flows\nand is limited to the amount by which the\nsecurity\u2019s amortized cost exceeds its fair\nvalue. See \u201cNote 2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for\nadditional information.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for\ninvestment, including loans underlying our\nconsolidated securitization trusts, and loans\nheld for sale and is divided into three\nportfolio segments: credit card, consumer\nbanking and commercial banking loans. Credit\ncard loans consist of domestic and\ninternational credit card loans. Consumer\nbanking loans consist of auto and retail\nbanking loans. Commercial banking loans\nconsist of commercial and multifamily real\nestate loans as well as commercial and\nindustrial loans.\n                                              \n  130    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nLoan Classification\nWe classify loans as held for investment or\nheld for sale based on our investment strategy\nand management\u2019s intent and ability with\nregard to the loans, which may change over\ntime. The accounting and measurement framework\nfor loans differs depending on the loan\nclassification, whether we elect the fair\nvalue option, whether the loans are originated\nor purchased and whether purchased loans are\nconsidered to have experienced a more-than-\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination. The presentation within the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows is based\non management\u2019s intent at acquisition or\norigination. Cash flows related to loans that\nare acquired or originated with the intent to\nhold for investment are included in cash flows\nfrom investing activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Cash flows related\nto loans that are acquired or originated with\nthe intent to sell are included in cash flows\nfrom operating activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\n\nLoans Held for Investment\n\nLoans that we have the ability and intent to\nhold for the foreseeable future and loans\nassociated with consolidated securitization\ntransactions are classified as held for\ninvestment. Loans classified as held for\ninvestment, except for credit card loans, are\nreported at their amortized cost basis,\nexcluding accrued interest. For these loans,\nwe elect to present accrued interest within\ninterest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For credit card loans, billed\nfinance charges and fees are included in loans\nheld for investment. Unbilled finance charges\nand fees on credit card loans are included in\ninterest receivable.\n\nInterest income is recognized on performing\nloans on an accrual basis. We defer loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts on originated loans, premiums and\ndiscounts on purchased loans and loan\ncommitment fees. We recognize these amounts in\ninterest income as yield adjustments over the\nlife of the loan and/or commitment period\nusing the effective interest method. For\ncredit card loans, loan origination fees and\ndirect loan origination costs are amortized on\na straight-line basis over a 12-month period.\nThe amortized cost of loans held for\ninvestment is subject to our allowance for\ncredit losses methodology described below\nunder the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note.\n\nLoans Held for Sale\n\nLoans that we intend to sell or for which we\ndo not have the ability and intent to hold for\nthe foreseeable future are classified as held\nfor sale. Multifamily commercial real estate\nloans originated with the intent to sell to\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises are accounted\nfor under the fair value option. We elect the\nfair value option on these loans as part of\nour management of interest rate risk along\nwith the corresponding forward sale\ncommitments. Loan origination fees and direct\nloan origination costs are recognized as\nincurred and are reported in other non-\ninterest income in the consolidated statements\nof income. Interest income is calculated based\non the loan's stated rate of interest and is\nreported in interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of income. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nAll other loans classified as held for sale\nare recorded at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue. Loan origination fees, direct loan\norigination costs and any discounts and\npremiums are deferred until the loan is sold\nand are then recognized as part of the total\ngain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans\nheld for sale is determined on an aggregate\nportfolio basis for each loan type. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nIf a loan is transferred from held for\ninvestment to held for sale, then on the\ntransfer date, any decline in fair value\nrelated to credit is recorded as a charge-off\nand any allowance for credit losses is\nreversed through our provision for credit\nlosses. The loan is then reclassified to held\nfor sale at its amortized cost at the date of\nthe transfer. A valuation allowance is\nestablished, if needed, such that the loan\nheld for sale is recorded at the lower of cost\nor fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we\nreport write-downs or recoveries in fair value\nup to the carrying value at the date of\ntransfer and realized gains or losses on loans\nheld for sale in our consolidated statements\nof income as a component of other non-interest\nincome. We calculate the gain or loss on loan\nsales as the difference between the proceeds\nreceived and the carrying value of the loans\nsold, net of the fair value of any residual\ninterests retained.\n\nLoans Acquired\n\nAll purchased loans, including loans\ntransferred in a business combination, are\ninitially recorded at fair value, which\nincludes consideration of expected future\nlosses, as of the date of the acquisition. To\ndetermine the fair value of loans at\nacquisition, we estimate discounted\ncontractual cash flows due using an observable\nmarket rate of interest, when available,\nadjusted for factors that a market participant\nwould consider in determining fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, contractual cash flows\nare adjusted\n                                              \n  131    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nto include prepayment estimates based upon\nhistorical payment trends, forecasted default\nrates and loss severities and other relevant\nfactors. The difference between the fair value\nand the contractual cash flows is recorded as\na loan premium or discount, which may relate\nto either credit or non-credit factors, at\nacquisition.\n\nWe account for purchased loans under the\naccounting guidance for purchased financial\nassets with credit deterioration when, at the\ntime of purchase, the loans have experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination. We also\naccount for loans under this guidance when the\nloans were previously accounted for under the\naccounting guidance for purchased credit\nimpaired loans and debt securities (\u201cPCI\u201d)\nprior to our adoption of the CECL standard. We\nrefer to these loans which are accounted for\nunder accounting guidance for purchased\nfinancial assets with more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination as \u201cPCD loans\u201d.\n\nWe recognize an allowance for credit losses on\npurchased loans that have not experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination at the time\nof purchase through earnings in a manner that\nis consistent with originated loans. The\npolicies relating to the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans is described below in the\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\u201d section of this Note.\nLoan Modifications and Restructurings\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide modifications to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty to improve\nlong-term collectability of the loan and to\navoid the need for foreclosure or repossession\nof collateral, if any. Our loan modifications\ntypically include short-term payment\ndeferrals, an extension of the loan term, a\nreduction in the interest rate, a reduction in\nthe loan balance, or a combination of these\nconcessions. A loan modification in which a\nconcession is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty is accounted\nfor and reported as a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d). See \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for\nadditional information on our loan\nmodifications and restructurings, including\nthose in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDelinquent and Nonperforming Loans\nThe entire balance of a loan is considered\ncontractually delinquent if the minimum\nrequired payment is not received by the first\nstatement cycle date equal to or following the\ndue date specified on the customer\u2019s billing\nstatement. Delinquency is reported on loans\nthat are 30or more days past due. Interest and\nfees continue to accrue on past due loans\nuntil the date the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, if applicable. For loan\nmodifications, delinquency and nonaccrual\nstatus are reported in accordance with the\nrevised terms of the loans. We generally place\nloans on nonaccrual status when we believe the\ncollectability of interest and principal is\nnot reasonably assured.\n\nNonperforming loans generally include loans\nthat have been placed on nonaccrual status. We\ndo not report loans classified as held for\nsale as nonperforming.\n\nOur policies for classifying loans as\nnonperforming, by loan category, are as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Credit card loans: As permitted by\nregulatory guidance issued by the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council\n(\u201cFFIEC\u201d), our policy is generally to exempt\ncredit card loans from being classified as\nnonperforming, as these loans are generally\ncharged off in the period the account becomes\n180days past due. Consistent with industry\nconventions, we generally continue to accrue\ninterest and fees on delinquent credit card\nloans until the loans are charged off.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We classify consumer\nbanking loans as nonperforming when we\ndetermine that the collectability of all\ninterest and principal on the loan is not\nreasonably assured, generally when the loan\nbecomes 90days past due.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans : We classify\ncommercial banking loans as nonperforming as\nof the date we determine that the\ncollectability of all interest and principal\non the loan is not reasonably assured.\n                                              \n  132    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n\u2022 Modified loans and troubled debt\nrestructurings: Modified loans, including\nTDRs, that are current at the time of the\nrestructuring remain in accrual status if\nthere is demonstrated performance prior to the\nrestructuring and continued performance under\nthe modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the\nmodified loan is classified as nonperforming.\n\nInterest and fees accrued but not collected at\nthe date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status\nare reversed against earnings. In addition,\nthe amortization of deferred loan fees, costs,\npremiums and discounts is suspended. Interest\nand fee income are subsequently recognized\nonly upon the receipt of cash payments.\nHowever, if there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectability of loan principal,\ncash received is generally applied against the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status\nwhen all principal and interest is current and\nrepayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest is reasonably assured,\nor when the loan is both well-secured and in\nthe process of collection and collectability\nis no longer doubtful.\nCharge-Offs\nWe charge off loans when we determine that the\nloan is uncollectible. The amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, is charged\noff as a reduction to the allowance for credit\nlosses based on the time frames presented\nbelow. Accrued interest on loans other than\ncredit card loans determined to be\nuncollectible is reversed as a reduction of\ninterest income when the loan is classified as\nnonperforming. For credit card loans, accrued\ninterest is charged off simultaneously with\nthe charge off of other components of\namortized cost and as a reduction of interest\nincome. When received, recoveries of\npreviously charged off amounts are recorded as\nan increase to the allowance for credit losses\n(see the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note for\ninformation on how we account for expected\nrecoveries). Costs to recover charged off\nloans are recorded as collection expense and\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense as incurred. Our charge-off time\nframes by loan type are presented below.\n\n\u2022 Credit card loans : We generally charge off\ncredit card loans in the period the account\nbecomes 180days past due. We charge off\ndelinquent credit card loans for which\nrevolving privileges have been revoked as part\nof loan workout when the account becomes\n120days past due. Credit card loans in\nbankruptcy are generally charged off by the\nend of the month following 30days after the\nreceipt of a complete bankruptcy notification\nfrom the bankruptcy court. Credit card loans\nof deceased account holders are generally\ncharged off 5days after receipt of\nnotification.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We generally charge\noff consumer banking loans at the earlier of\nthe date when the account is a specified\nnumber of days past due or upon repossession\nof the underlying collateral. Our charge-off\nperiod for auto loans is 120days past due.\nSmall business banking loans generally charge\noff at 120days past due based on the date the\namortized cost basis is deemed uncollectible.\nAuto loans that have not been previously\ncharged off where the borrower has filed for\nbankruptcy and the loan has not been\nreaffirmed charge off in the period that the\nloan is 60days from the bankruptcy\nnotification date, regardless of delinquency\nstatus. Auto loans that have not been\npreviously charged off and have been\ndischarged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are\ncharged off at the end of the month in which\nthe bankruptcy discharge occurs. Remaining\nconsumer loans generally are charged off\nwithin 40days of receipt of notification from\nthe bankruptcy court. Consumer loans of\ndeceased account holders are charged off by\nthe end of the month following 60days of\nreceipt of notification.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans: We charge off\ncommercial loans in the period we determine\nthat the amortized cost basis is\nuncollectible.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\n(\u201callowance\u201d) that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\nover the contractual terms of our loans held\nfor investment. We measure the allowance on a\nquarterly basis through consideration of past\nevents, including historical experience,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts.\n\nWe measure current expected credit losses over\nthe contractual terms of our loans. The\ncontractual terms are adjusted for expected\nprepayments but are not extended for renewals\nor extensions, except when an extension or\nrenewal arises from a borrower option that is\nnot unconditionally cancellable or through a\nTDR that is reasonably expected to occur.\n                                              \n  133    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWe aggregate loans sharing similar risk\ncharacteristics into pools for purposes of\nmeasuring expected credit losses. Pools are\nreassessed periodically to confirm that all\nloans within each pool continue to share\nsimilar risk characteristics. Expected credit\nlosses for loans that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with other financial\nassets are measured individually.\n\nExpected recoveries of amounts previously\ncharged off or expected to be charged off are\nrecognized within the allowance, with a\ncorresponding reduction to our provision for\ncredit losses. At times expected recoveries\nmay result in a negative allowance. We limit\nthe allowance to amounts previously charged\noff and expected to be charged off. Charge-\noffs of uncollectible amounts result in a\nreduction to the allowance and recoveries of\npreviously charged off amounts result in an\nincrease to the allowance.\n\nWhen developing an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information, or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Significant judgment is\napplied to the development and duration of\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used in\nour estimation of lifetime losses. We estimate\nexpected credit losses over the duration of\nthose forecasts and then revert, on a rational\nand systematic basis, to historical losses at\neach relevant loss component of the estimate.\nExpected losses for contractual terms\nextending beyond the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast and reversion periods are\nbased on those historical losses.\n\nManagement will consider and may qualitatively\nadjust for conditions, changes and trends in\nloan portfolios that may not be captured in\nmodeled results. These adjustments are\nreferred to as qualitative factors and\nrepresent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses. Management\u2019s\njudgment may involve an assessment of current\nand forward-looking conditions including but\nnot limited to changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, nature and volume of the\nportfolio, external factors, and uncertainty\nas it relates to economic, model or forecast\nrisks, where not already captured in the\nmodeled results.\n\nExpected credit losses for collateral-\ndependent loans are based on the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral. When we intend to\nliquidate the collateral, the fair value of\nthe collateral is adjusted for expected costs\nto sell. A loan is deemed to be a collateral-\ndependent loan when (i) we determine\nforeclosure or repossession of the underlying\ncollateral is probable, or (ii) foreclosure or\nrepossession is not probable, but the borrower\nis experiencing financial difficulty and we\nexpect repayment to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the\ncollateral. The allowance for a collateral-\ndependent loan reflects the difference between\nthe loan\u2019s amortized cost basis and the fair\nvalue (less selling costs, where applicable)\nof the loan's underlying collateral.\n\nOur credit card and consumer banking loan\nportfolios consist of smaller-balance,\nhomogeneous loans. The consumer banking loan\nportfolio is divided into two primary\nportfolio segments: auto loans and retail\nbanking loans. The credit card and consumer\nbanking loan portfolios are further divided by\nour business units into groups based on common\nrisk characteristics, such as origination\nyear, contract type, interest rate, borrower\ncredit score and geography. The commercial\nbanking loan portfolio is primarily composed\nof larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans.\nThese loans are subject to reviews that result\nin internal risk ratings. In assessing the\nrisk rating of a particular commercial banking\nloan, among the factors we consider are the\nfinancial condition of the borrower,\ngeography, collateral performance, historical\nloss experience and industry-specific\ninformation that management believes is\nrelevant in determining and measuring expected\ncredit losses. Subjective assessment and\ninterpretation are involved. Emphasizing one\nfactor over another or considering additional\nfactors could impact the risk rating assigned\nto that commercial banking loan.\n\nFor consumer banking and commercial banking\nloans, the contractual period typically does\nnot include renewals or extensions because the\nrenewals and extensions are generally not at\nthe borrower\u2019s exclusive option to exercise.\nManagement has determined that the undrawn\ncredit exposure that is associated with our\ncredit card loans is unconditionally\ncancellable. For this reason, expected credit\nlosses are measured based on the drawn balance\nat each quarterly measurement date, but not on\nthe undrawn exposure. Because credit card\nloans do not have a defined contractual life,\nmanagement estimates both the volume and\napplication of payments to determine a\ncontractual life of the drawn balance at the\nmeasurement date over which expected credit\nlosses are developed for credit card loans.\n                                              \n  134    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWith the exception of credit card loans, we\nhave made a policy election to not measure an\nallowance on accrued interest for loans held\nfor investment because we reverse\nuncollectible accrued interest in a timely\nmanner. See the \u201cDelinquent and Nonperforming\nLoans\u201d and \u201cCharge-Offs - Loans\u201d sections of\nthis Note for information on what we consider\ntimely. For credit card loans, we do not make\nthis election, as we reserve for uncollectible\naccrued interest relating to credit card loans\nin the allowance.\n\nThe allowance related to credit card and\nconsumer banking loans assessed on a pooled\nbasis is based on a modeled calculation, which\nis supplemented by management judgment as\ndescribed above. Because of the homogeneous\nnature of our consumer loan portfolios, the\nallowance is based on the aggregated portfolio\nsegment evaluations. The allowance is\nestablished through a process that begins with\nestimates of historical losses in each pool\nbased upon various statistical analyses, with\nadjustments for current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions, which includes expected economic\nconditions. Loss forecast models are utilized\nto estimate expected credit losses and\nconsider several portfolio indicators\nincluding, but not limited to, expected\neconomic conditions, historical loss\nexperience, account seasoning, the value of\ncollateral underlying secured loans, estimated\nforeclosures or defaults based on observable\ntrends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings,\nunemployment, borrower credit scores and\ngeneral business trends. Management believes\nthese factors are relevant in estimating\nexpected credit losses and also considers an\nevaluation of overall portfolio credit quality\nbased on indicators such as changes in our\ncredit evaluation, underwriting and collection\nmanagement policies, the effect of other\nexternal factors such as competition and legal\nand regulatory requirements, general economic\nconditions and business trends, and\nuncertainties in forecasting and modeling\ntechniques used in estimating our allowance.\n\nThe allowance related to commercial banking\nloans assessed on a pooled basis is based on\nour historical loss experience for loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics and consideration\nof the current credit quality of the\nportfolio, which is supplemented by management\njudgment as described above. These are\nadjusted for current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions likely to cause future losses which\nvary from historical levels. We apply internal\nrisk ratings to commercial banking loans,\nwhich we use to assess credit quality and\nderive a total loss estimate based on an\nestimated probability of default (\u201cdefault\nrate\u201d) and loss given default (\u201closs\nseverity\u201d). Management may also apply judgment\nto adjust the loss factors derived, taking\ninto consideration both quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including general\neconomic conditions, industry-specific and\ngeographic trends, portfolio concentrations,\ntrends in internal credit quality indicators,\nand current and past underwriting standards\nthat have occurred but are not yet reflected\nin the historical data underlying our loss\nestimates.\n\nThe allowance related to smaller-balance\nhomogeneous credit card and consumer banking\nloans whose terms have been modified in a TDR\nis calculated on a pool basis using historical\nloss experience, adjusted for current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of conditions likely to cause future\nlosses which vary from historical levels for\nthe respective class of assets. The allowance\nrelated to consumer banking loans that are\nassessed at a loan-level is determined based\non key considerations that include the\nborrower\u2019s overall financial condition,\nresources and payment history, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, and when applicable, the estimated\nrealizable value of any collateral. The\nallowance related to commercial banking loans\nthat are assessed at a loan-level is generally\ndetermined in accordance with our policy for\nestimating expected credit losses for\ncollateral-dependent loans as described above.\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures\nIn addition to the allowance, we also measure\nexpected credit losses related to unfunded\nlending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable in our Commercial\nBanking business. This reserve is measured\nusing the same measurement objectives as the\nallowance for loans held for investment and is\nrecorded within other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. These commitments\nare segregated by risk according to our\ninternal risk rating scale, which we use to\nassess credit quality and derive an expected\ncredit loss estimate. We assess these risk\nclassifications, taking into consideration\nboth quantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of conditions likely to\ncause future losses which vary from historical\nlevels, and utilization assumptions to\nestimate the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Expected credit losses are not\nmeasured on unfunded lending commitments that\nare unconditionally cancellable, including all\nof our unfunded credit card and consumer\nbanking lending commitments and certain of our\nunfunded commercial banking lending\ncommitments.\n                                              \n  135    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nDetermining the appropriateness of the\nallowance and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is complex and requires judgment\nby management about the effect of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. Subsequent\nevaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of\nthe factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments in future\nperiods. See \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments\u201d for additional information.\nSignificant Accounting Policies Prior to our\nAdoption of the CECL Standard\n\nLoans Held for Investment - Estimate of\nIncurred Loan and Lease Losses\nIn periods prior to 2020, the allowance\nrepresented management\u2019s current estimate of\nincurred loan and lease losses inherent in our\nloans held for investment portfolio as of each\nbalance sheet date. The provision for credit\nlosses reflected credit losses we believed had\nbeen incurred and would eventually be\nrecognized over time through charge-offs.\n\nManagement performed a quarterly analysis of\nour loan portfolio to determine if impairment\nhad occurred and to assess the adequacy of the\nallowance based on historical and current\ntrends as well as other factors affecting\ncredit losses. We applied documented\nsystematic methodologies to separately\ncalculate the allowance for our credit card,\nconsumer banking and commercial banking loan\nportfolios. Our allowance for loan and lease\nlosses consisted of three components that were\nallocated to cover the estimated probable\nlosses in each loan portfolio based on the\nresults of our detailed review and loan\nimpairment assessment process: (i) a component\nfor loans collectively evaluated for\nimpairment; (ii) an asset-specific component\nfor individually impaired loans; and (iii) a\ncomponent related to PCI loans that\nexperienced significant decreases in expected\ncash flows subsequent to acquisition. Each of\nour allowance components was supplemented by\nan amount that represented management\u2019s\nqualitative judgment of the imprecision and\nrisks inherent in the processes and\nassumptions used in establishing the\nallowance.\n\nThe component of the allowance related to\ncredit card and consumer banking loans that we\ncollectively evaluated for impairment was\nbased on a statistical calculation. The\ncomponent of the allowance for commercial\nbanking loans that we collectively evaluated\nfor impairment was based on our historical\nloss experience for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics and consideration of the\ncurrent credit quality of the portfolio. The\nasset-specific component of the allowance\nincludes smaller-balance homogeneous credit\ncard and consumer banking loans whose terms\nhave been modified in a TDR and larger-balance\nnonperforming, non-homogeneous commercial\nbanking loans. We generally measured the\nasset-specific component of the allowance\nbased on the difference between the recorded\ninvestment of individually impaired loans and\nthe present value of expected future cash\nflows. In addition to the allowance, we also\nestimated probable losses related to\ncontractually binding unfunded lending\ncommitments.\n\nLoans Acquired - Credit Impaired\n\nFor PCI loans, we aggregated loans acquired in\nthe same fiscal quarter into one or more pools\nif the loans have common risk characteristics.\nA pool is then accounted for as a single\nasset, with a single composite interest rate\nand an aggregate fair value and expected cash\nflows.\n\nSubsequent to acquisition, decreases in\nexpected cash flows resulting from credit\ndeterioration subsequent to acquisition\ngenerally resulted in an impairment charge\nrecognized in our provision for credit losses\nand an increase in the allowance for loan and\nlease losses. Significant increases in the\ncash flows expected to be collected would\nfirst reduce any previously recorded allowance\nfor loan and lease losses. See \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d\nfor additional information.\n\nWe recorded charge-offs on PCI loans only if\nactual losses exceed estimated credit losses\nincorporated into the fair value recorded at\nacquisition. Further, PCI loans are not\nclassified as delinquent or nonperforming.\nSecuritization of Loans\nOur loan securitization activities primarily\ninvolve the securitization of credit card and\nauto loans, which provides a source of funding\nfor us. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Variable Interest Entities\nand Securitizations\u201d for additional details.\nLoan securitization involves the transfer of a\npool of loan receivables from our portfolio to\na trust. The trust then sells an undivided\ninterest in the pool of loan receivables to\nthird-party investors through the issuance of\ndebt securities and transfers the proceeds\nfrom the debt issuance to us as consideration\nfor the loan receivables transferred. The debt\nsecurities are collateralized by the loan\nreceivables\n                                              \n  136    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \ntransferred from our portfolio. We remove\nloans from our consolidated balance sheets\nwhen securitizations qualify as sales to non-\nconsolidated VIEs, recognize assets retained\nand liabilities assumed at fair value and\nrecord a gain or loss on the transferred\nloans. Alternatively, when the transfer does\nnot qualify as a sale but instead is\nconsidered a secured borrowing, the assets\nwill remain on our consolidated balance sheets\nwith an offsetting liability recognized for\nthe amount of proceeds received.\nPremises, Equipment and Leases\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold\nimprovements, are carried at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nLand is carried at cost. We capitalize direct\ncosts incurred during the application\ndevelopment stage of internally developed\nsoftware projects. Depreciation and\namortization expenses are calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets. Useful lives for premises\nand equipment are estimated as follows:\n                                              \n  Premises and          Useful Lives          \n  Equipment                                   \n  Buildings and         5-39years             \n  improvements                                \n  Furniture and         3-10years             \n  equipment                                   \n  Computer software     3years                \n  Leasehold             Lesser of the useful  \n  improvements          life or the           \n                        remaining lease term  \n                                              \nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are\nexpensed as incurred and gains or losses upon\ndisposition are recognized in our consolidated\nstatements of income as realized. See \u201cNote\n7\u2014Premises, Equipment and Leases\u201d for\nadditional information.\nLeases\nLease classification is determined at\ninception for all lease transactions with an\ninitial term greater than one year. Operating\nleases are included as right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d)\nassets within other assets, and operating\nlease liabilities are classified as other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets. Finance leases are included in\npremises and equipment, and other borrowings\non our consolidated balance sheets. Our\noperating lease expense is included in\noccupancy and equipment within non-interest\nexpense in our consolidated statements of\nincome. Lease expense for minimum lease\npayments are recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. See \u201cNote\n7\u2014Premises, Equipment and Leases\u201d for\nadditional information.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the\nacquisition price of an acquired business over\nthe fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed and is assigned to one or\nmore reporting units at the date of\nacquisition. A reporting unit is defined as an\noperating segment, or a business unit that is\none level below an operating segment. We have\nfourreporting units: Credit Card, Auto, Other\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for\nimpairment at the reporting unit level\nannually or more frequently if adverse\ncircumstances indicate that it is more likely\nthan not that the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value. These\nindicators could include a sustained,\nsignificant decline in the Company\u2019s stock\nprice, a decline in expected future cash\nflows, significant disposition activity, a\nsignificant adverse change in the economic or\nbusiness environment, and the testing for\nrecoverability of a significant asset group,\namong others.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are\namortized on either an accelerated or\nstraight-line basis over their estimated\nuseful lives and are evaluated for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying amount of the assets may\nnot be recoverable. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and\nIntangible Assets\u201d for additional information.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) are\ninitially recorded at fair value when mortgage\nloans are sold or securitized in the secondary\nmarket and the right to service these loans is\nretained for a fee. Commercial MSRs are\nsubsequently accounted for under the\namortization method. We evaluate for\nimpairment as of each reporting date and\nrecognize any impairment in other non-interest\nincome. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Intangible\nAssets\u201d for additional information.\n                                              \n  137    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nForeclosed Property and Repossessed Assets\nForeclosed property and repossessed assets\nobtained through our lending activities\ntypically include commercial real estate or\npersonal property, such as automobiles, and\nare recorded at net realizable value. For\nforeclosed property and repossessed assets, we\ngenerally reclassify the loan to repossessed\nassets upon repossession of the property in\nsatisfaction of the loan. Net realizable value\nis the estimated fair value of the underlying\ncollateral less estimated selling costs and is\nbased on appraisals, when available.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, foreclosed\nproperty and repossessed assets are recorded\nat the lower of our initial cost basis or net\nrealizable value, which is routinely monitored\nand updated. Any changes in net realizable\nvalue and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of the property are recorded in\nother non-interest expense. See \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair\nValue Measurement\u201d for details.\nRestricted Equity Investments\nWe have investments in Federal Home Loan Banks\n(\u201cFHLB\u201d) stock and in the Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFederal\nReserve\u201d) stock. These investments, which are\nincluded in other assets on our consolidated\nbalance sheets, are not marketable, are\ncarried at cost, and are reviewed for\nimpairment if there is any indicator of\nimpairment.\nLitigation\nWe establish reserves for litigation-related\nmatters, including mortgage representation and\nwarranty related matters, that arise from the\nordinary course of our business activities\nwhen it is probable that a loss associated\nwith a claim or proceeding has been incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Professional service fees,\nincluding lawyers\u2019 and experts\u2019 fees, expected\nto be incurred in connection with a loss\ncontingency are expensed as services are\nprovided. See \u201cNote 18\u2014Commitments,\nContingencies, Guarantees and Others\u201d for\nadditional information.\nCustomer Rewards Reserve\nWe offer products, primarily credit cards,\nwhich include programs that allow members to\nearn rewards based on account activity that\ncan be redeemed for cash (primarily in the\nform of statement credits), gift cards,\ntravel, or covering eligible charges. The\namount of reward that a customer earns varies\nbased on the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program and product. When rewards are\nearned by a customer, rewards expense is\ngenerally recorded as an offset to interchange\nincome, with a corresponding increase to the\ncustomer rewards reserve. The customer rewards\nreserve is computed based on the estimated\nfuture cost of earned rewards that are\nexpected to be redeemed and is reduced as\nrewards are redeemed. In estimating the\ncustomer rewards reserve, we consider\nhistorical redemption and spending behavior,\nas well as the terms and conditions of the\ncurrent rewards programs, among other factors.\nWe expect the vast majority of all rewards\nearned will eventually be redeemed. The\ncustomer rewards reserve, which is included in\nother liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets, totaled $ 5.4billion and $ 4.7billion\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest Income and Fees\nInterest income and fees on loans and\ninvestment securities are recognized based on\nthe contractual provisions of the underlying\narrangements.\nLoan origination fees and costs and premiums\nand discounts on loans held for investment are\ndeferred and generally amortized into interest\nincome as yield adjustments over the\ncontractual life and/or commitment period\nusing the effective interest method. Costs\ndeferred include direct origination costs such\nas bounties paid to third parties for new\naccounts and incentives paid to our network of\nauto dealers for loan referrals. In certain\ncircumstances, we elect to factor prepayment\nestimates into the calculation of the constant\neffective yield necessary to apply the\ninterest method. Prepayment estimates are\nbased on historical prepayment data, existing\nand forecasted interest rates, and economic\ndata. For credit card loans, loan origination\nfees and direct loan origination costs are\namortized on a straight-line basis over a\n12-month period.\nUnamortized premiums, discounts and other\nbasis adjustments on investment securities are\ngenerally recognized in interest income over\nthe contractual lives of the securities using\nthe effective interest method. However,\npremiums for certain callable investment\nsecurities are amortized to the earliest call\ndate.\n                                              \n  138    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare recorded in revenue when earned. Billed\nfinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare included in loan receivables. Unbilled\nfinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare included in interest receivable on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Annual membership\nfees are classified as service charges and\nother customer-related fees in our\nconsolidated statements of income and are\ndeferred and amortized into income over\n12months on a straight-line basis. We continue\nto accrue finance charges and fees on credit\ncard loans until the account is charged off.\nInterchange Income\nInterchange income generally represents fees\nfor standing ready to authorize and providing\nsettlement on credit and debit card\ntransactions processed through the MasterCard\u00ae\n(\u201cMasterCard\u201d) and Visa\u00ae (\u201cVisa\u201d) interchange\nnetworks. The levels and structure of\ninterchange rates set by MasterCard and Visa\nand can vary based on cardholder purchase\nvolumes, among other factors. We recognize\ninterchange income upon settlement. See \u201cNote\n17\u2014Business Segments and Revenue from\nContracts with Customers\u201d for additional\ndetails.\nCard Partnership Agreements\nWe have contractual agreements with certain\nretailers and other partners to provide\nlending and other services to mutual\ncustomers. We primarily issue private-label\nand cobrand credit card loans to these\ncustomers over the term of the partnership\nagreements, which typically range from two\nyearsto ten years.\n\nCertain partners assist in or perform\nmarketing activities on our behalf and promote\nour products and services to their customers.\nAs compensation for providing these services,\nwe often pay royalties, bounties or other\nspecial bonuses to these partners. Depending\nupon the nature of the payments, they are\nrecorded as reductions of revenue, marketing\nexpenses or other operating expenses. Our\ncredit card partnership agreements may also\nprovide for profit or revenue sharing payments\nwhich are presented as a reduction of the\nrelated revenue line item(s) when owed to the\npartner.\n\nWhen a partner agrees to share a portion of\nthe credit losses associated with the\npartnership, we evaluate the contractual\nprovisions for the loss share payments as well\nas applicable accounting guidance to determine\nwhether to present the sharing of losses on a\ngross or net basis in our consolidated\nfinancial statements. When loss sharing\namounts due from partners are presented on a\nnet basis, they are recorded as a reduction to\nour provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and reduce\nthe charge-off amounts that we report. The\nallowance for credit losses attributable to\nthese portfolios is also reduced by the\nexpected reimbursements from these partners\nfor loss sharing amounts. See \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for additional\ninformation related to our loss sharing\narrangements. For loss sharing arrangements\npresented on a gross basis, any loss share\npayments due from the partner are recorded as\na part of revenue, and the allowance for\ncredit losses is not reduced by the expected\nloss share reimbursements, but rather an\nindemnification asset is recorded. Our\nconsolidated net income is the same regardless\nof how revenue and loss sharing arrangements\nare reported.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nA collaborative arrangement is a contractual\narrangement that involves a joint operating\nactivity between two or more parties that are\nactive participants in the activity. These\nparties are exposed to significant risks and\nrewards based upon the economic success of the\njoint operating activity. We assess each of\nour partnership agreements with profit,\nrevenue or loss sharing payments to determine\nif a collaborative arrangement exists and, if\nso, how revenue generated from third parties,\ncosts incurred and transactions between\nparticipants in the collaborative arrangement\nshould be accounted for and reported on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nWe currently have one partnership agreement\nthat meets the definition of a collaborative\nagreement. We share a fixed percentage of\nrevenues, consisting of finance charges and\nlate fees, with the partner, and the partner\nis required to reimburse us for a fixed\npercentage of credit losses incurred. Revenues\nand losses related to the partner\u2019s credit\ncard program and partnership agreement are\nreported on a net basis in our consolidated\nfinancial statements. Revenue sharing amounts\nattributable to the partner are recorded as an\noffset against total net revenue in our\nconsolidated statements of income. Interest\nincome was reduced by $ 1.1billion, $\n1.0billion and $ 1.3billion in December 31,\n2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for amounts\nearned by the partner pursuant to the\npartnership agreement. The impact of all of\nour loss sharing arrangements that are\npresented on a net basis is included in \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments.\u201d\n                                              \n  139    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nStock-Based Compensation\nWe are authorized to issue stock\u2013based\ncompensation to employees and directors in\nvarious forms, primarily as restricted stock\nunits (\u201cRSUs\u201d), performance share units and\nstock options. In addition, we also issue cash\nequity units and cash-settled restricted stock\nunits which are not counted against the common\nshares reserved for issuance or available for\nissuance because they are settled in cash.\nFor awards settled in shares, we generally\nrecognize compensation expense on a straight-\nline basis over the award\u2019s requisite service\nperiod based on the fair value of the award at\nthe grant date. If an award settled in shares\ncontains a performance condition with graded\nvesting, we recognize compensation expense\nusing the accelerated attribution method.\nEquity units and restricted stock units that\nare cash-settled are accounted for as\nliability awards which results in quarterly\nexpense fluctuations based on changes in our\nstock price through the date that the awards\nare settled. Awards that continue to vest\nafter retirement are expensed over the shorter\nof the time period between the grant date and\nthe final vesting period or between the grant\ndate and when the participant becomes\nretirement eligible. Awards to participants\nwho are retirement eligible at the grant date\nare subject to immediate expense recognition.\nStock-based compensation expense is included\nin salaries and associate benefits in the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nFor RSUs and performance share units, the fair\nvalue of stock-based compensation used in\ndetermining compensation expense will\ngenerally equal the fair market value of our\ncommon stock on the date of grant. Stock-based\ncompensation expense for equity classified\nstock options is based on the grant date fair\nvalue, which is estimated using a Black-\nScholes option pricing model. Certain share-\nsettled awards have discretionary vesting\nconditions which result in the remeasurement\nof these awards at fair value each reporting\nperiod and the potential for compensation\nexpense to fluctuate with changes in our stock\nprice. See \u201cNote 13\u2014Stock-Based Compensation\nPlans\u201d for additional details.\nMarketing Expenses\nMarketing expense includes the cost of our\nvarious promotional efforts to attract and\nretain customers such as advertising,\npromotional materials, and certain customer\nincentives. We expense marketing costs as\nincurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize the current and deferred tax\nconsequences of all transactions that have\nbeen recognized in the financial statements\nusing the provisions of the enacted tax laws.\nCurrent income tax expense represents our\nestimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period and includes income tax expense\nrelated to our uncertain tax positions, as\nwell as tax-related interest and penalties.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that will be in\neffect when the differences are expected to\nreverse. We record valuation allowances to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. We\nrecord the effect of remeasuring deferred tax\nassets and liabilities due to a change in tax\nrates or laws as a component of income tax\nexpense related to continuing operations for\nthe period in which the change is enacted. We\nsubsequently release income tax effects\nstranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach.\nIncome tax benefits are recognized when, based\non their technical merits, they are more\nlikely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination. The amount recognized is the\nlargest amount of benefit that is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement. See\n\u201cNote 15\u2014Income Taxes\u201d for additional details.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated and reported\nunder the \u201ctwo-class\u201d method. The \u201ctwo-class\u201d\nmethod is an earnings allocation method under\nwhich earnings per share is calculated for\neach class of common stock and participating\nsecurity considering both dividends declared\nor accumulated and participation rights in\nundistributed earnings as if all such earnings\nhad been distributed during the period. We\nhave unvested share-based payment awards which\nhave a right to receive non-forfeitable\ndividends, which are deemed to be\nparticipating securities.\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by\ndividing net income, after deducting dividends\non preferred stock and participating\nsecurities as well as undistributed earnings\nallocated to participating securities, by the\naverage number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period, net of any treasury shares.\nWe calculate diluted earnings per share in a\nsimilar manner after consideration of the\npotential dilutive effect of common stock\nequivalents on the average number of common\nshares\n                                              \n  140    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \noutstanding during the period. Common stock\nequivalents include warrants, stock options,\nrestricted stock awards and units, and\nperformance share awards and units. Common\nstock equivalents are calculated based upon\nthe treasury stock method using an average\nmarket price of common shares during the\nperiod. Dilution is not considered when a net\nloss is reported. Common stock equivalents\nthat have an antidilutive effect are excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted earnings per\nshare. See \u201cNote 12\u2014Earnings Per Common Share\u201d\nfor additional details.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAll derivative financial instruments, whether\ndesignated for hedge accounting or not, are\nreported at their fair value on our\nconsolidated balance sheets as either assets\nor liabilities, with consideration of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements that\nallow us to net settle positive and negative\npositions and offset cash collateral with the\nsame counterparty. We report net derivatives\nin a gain position, or derivative assets, on\nour consolidated balance sheets as a component\nof other assets. We report net derivatives in\na loss position, or derivative liabilities, on\nour consolidated balance sheets as a component\nof other liabilities. See \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities\u201d for\nadditional details.\nFair Value\nFair value, also referred to as an exit price,\nis defined as the price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non whether the inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value are\nobservable or unobservable. Fair value\nmeasurement of a financial asset or liability\nis assigned to a level based on the lowest\nlevel of any input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement in its entirety. The\nthree levels of the fair value hierarchy are\ndescribed below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nrequires that we maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance also provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes to fair value in the\nconsolidated statements of income. See \u201cNote\n16\u2014Fair Value Measurement\u201d for additional\ninformation.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nWe account for business combinations under the\nacquisition method of accounting. Under the\nacquisition method, tangible and intangible\nidentifiable assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed and any noncontrolling interest in the\nacquiree are recorded at fair value as of the\nacquisition date, with limited exceptions.\nTransaction costs and costs to restructure the\nacquired company are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill is recognized as the excess of the\nacquisition price over the estimated fair\nvalue of the identifiable net assets acquired.\nLikewise, if the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is greater than the acquisition\nprice, a bargain purchase gain is recognized\nand recorded in other non-interest income.\nIf the acquired set of activities and assets\ndo not meet the accounting definition of a\nbusiness, the transaction is accounted for as\nan asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition,\nthe assets acquired are recorded at the\npurchase price plus any transaction costs\nincurred and no goodwill is recognized.\n                                              \n  141    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nAccounting Standards Adopted During the Twelve\nMonths Ended December 31, 2020\n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                 Aligns the                   \n                 requiremen\u2026                  \n                 for                          \n                 capitalizi\u2026                  \n  Cloud          implementa\u2026                  \n  Computing      costs          We adopted    \n  ASU No.        incurred in    this          \n  2018-15,       a hosting      guidance in   \n  Intangible\u2026    arrangement    the first     \n  and            that is a      quarter of    \n  Other\u2014Inte\u2026    service        2020 using    \n  Software       contract       the           \n  (Subtopic      with the       prospective   \n  350-40):Cu\u2026    requiremen\u2026    method of     \n  Accounting     for            adoption.     \n  for            capitalizi\u2026    Our adoption  \n  Implementa\u2026    implementa\u2026    of this       \n  Costs          costs          standard did  \n  Incurred in    incurred to    not have a    \n  a Cloud        develop or     material      \n  Computing      obtain         impact on     \n  Arrangement    internal-u\u2026    our           \n  That Is a      software       consolidated  \n  Service        (and           financial     \n  Contract       hosting        statements.   \n  Issued         arrangemen\u2026                  \n  August 2018    that                         \n                 include an                   \n                 internal-u\u2026                  \n                 software                     \n                 license).                    \n                 Historical                   \n                 guidance                     \n                 for                          \n                 goodwill                     \n                 impairment                   \n                 testing                      \n                 prescribed                   \n                 that the                     \n                 company                      \n                 must                         \n                 compare                      \n                 each                         \n                 reporting                    \n                 unit\u2019s                       \n                 carrying                     \n                 value to                     \n                 its fair                     \n                 value.

Agency securities\ninclude Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d) guaranteed\nsecurities, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d)\nissued securities. The carrying value of our\ninvestments in Agency and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities represented 96% of our total\ninvestment securities portfolio as of both\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the\nCECL standard which resulted in an increase of\nthe amortized cost basis and related allowance\nfor credit losses of PCD securities classified\nas available for sale. The allowance for\ncredit losses for these PCD securities is\nlimited to the amount by which the amortized\ncost basis of the security exceeds its fair\nvalue. This limitation resulted in an increase\nof $ 11million to our retained earnings with a\ncorresponding decrease in AOCI at adoption.\nOur disclosures below reflect these adoption\nchanges. Prior period presentation was not\nreclassified to conform to the current period\npresentation. See \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d for\nadditional information.\nThe table below presents the amortized cost,\ngross unrealized gains and losses, and fair\nvalue of securities available for sale as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.

We present our auto loan\nportfolio by FICO scores at origination and\nour retail banking loan portfolio by\ndelinquency status, which includes all past\ndue loans, both performing and nonperforming.\nTable 3.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by\nCredit Quality Indicator\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Amounts represent period-end loans held\nfor investment in each credit score category.\nAuto credit scores generally represent average\nFICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus\nat the time of application and are not\nrefreshed thereafter.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n                                              \n  149    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses for commercial loans. Generally,\nloans that are designated as criticized\nperforming and criticized nonperforming are\nreviewed quarterly by management to determine\nif they are appropriately classified/rated and\nwhether any impairment exists. Noncriticized\nloans are also generally reviewed, at least\nannually, to determine the appropriate risk\nrating. In addition, we evaluate the risk\nrating during the renewal process of any loan\nor if a loan becomes past due.\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019. The internal risk rating status\nincludes all past due loans, both performing\nand nonperforming.\nTable 3.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by\nInternal Risk Ratings\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             %             %             %    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n                                              \n      $      \u2026      $      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n      $      \u2026      $      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Criticized exposures correspond to the\n\u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d and\n\u201cDoubtful\u201d asset categories defined by bank\nregulatory authorities.\n(2) Includes PPP loans of $ 238million as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\n                                              \n  150    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nRevolving Loans Converted to Term Loans\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we\nconverted $ 602million of revolving loans to\nterm loans, primarily in our domestic credit\ncard and commercial banking loan portfolios.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nAdditional guidance issued by the Federal\nBanking Agencies and contained in the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security\nAct provides banking organizations with TDR\nrelief for modifications of current borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In\nadherence with the guidance, we assessed all\nloan modifications introduced to current\nborrowers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\nthrough December 31, 2020, that would have\nbeen designated as TDRs under our existing\npolicies, and followed guidance that any such\neligible loan modifications made on a\ntemporary and good faith basis are not\nconsidered TDRs. We consider the impact of all\nloan modifications, including those offered\nvia our COVID-19 programs, when estimating the\ncredit quality of our loan portfolio and\nestablishing allowance levels. For our\nCommercial Banking customers, enrollment in a\ncustomer assistance program is also considered\nin the assignment of an internal risk rating.\n\nTotal recorded TDRs were $ 2.1billion and $\n1.7billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.

Accordingly, our disclosures\nbelow reflect these adoption changes. Prior\nperiod presentation was not modified to\nconform to the current period presentation.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d for additional information.\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. When developing an estimate of\nexpected credit losses, we use both\nquantitative and qualitative methods in\nconsidering all available information relevant\nto assessing collectability. This may include\ninternal information, external information or\na combination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nSignificant judgment is applied in our\nestimation of lifetime credit losses.\nFor credit card loans, accrued interest is\ncharged off simultaneously with the charge off\nof other components of amortized cost as a\nreduction of revenue. Total net revenue was\nreduced by $ 1.1billion in 2020 for finance\ncharges and fees charged-off as uncollectible\nand by $ 1.4billion and $ 1.3billion in 2019\nand 2018, respectively, for the estimated\nuncollectible amount of billed finance charges\nand fees and related losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the years ended December 31, 2020,\n2019 and 2018. The allowance balance as of\nDecember 31, 2020 reflects the cumulative\neffects from adoption of the CECL standard and\nthe change to include finance charge and fee\nreserve in the allowance for credit losses.\nThe reserve for unfunded lending commitments\nbalance as of December 31, 2020 also reflects\nthe cumulative effects from adoption of the\nCECL standard, including the component of loss\nsharing agreements with the government-\nsponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) on multifamily\ncommercial real estate loans that are within\nthe scope of the CECL standard. Our allowance\nfor credit losses increased by $ 8.4billion to\n$ 15.6billion as of December 31, 2020 from\n2019, primarily driven by the allowance builds\nin the first and second quarters of 2020 from\nexpectations of economic worsening as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the\nadoption of the CECL standard in the first\nquarter of 2020.\n

have certain credit card partnership\nagreements that are presented within our\nconsolidated financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses. See \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\u201d for further discussion of\nour credit card partnership agreements.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in the\nestimated reimbursements from these partners\nfor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019\nand 2018.

Our\nprimary involvement with VIEs is related to\nour securitization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which have provided a source of funding\nfor us and enabled us to transfer a certain\nportion of the economic risk of the loans or\nrelated debt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet our maximum remaining funding\nobligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nvariable interest, aggregated based on VIEs\nwith similar characteristics as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019. We separately present\ninformation for consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       17       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       43       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  158    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026        7       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       69       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       76       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities owned by the VIE, which\nincludes the seller\u2019s interest and repurchased\nnotes held by other related parties.\n\n(2) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n596million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2020, and $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n741million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2019.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to GSEs who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nMSRs and service the transferred loans\npursuant to the guidelines set forth by the\nGSEs. As an investor, we hold primarily RMBS,\nCMBS, and ABS in our investment securities\nportfolio, which represent variable interests\nin the respective securitization trusts from\nwhich those securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either invest in securities issued by\nthe VIE and were not involved in the design of\nthe VIE or no transfers have occurred between\nthe VIE and us. Our maximum exposure to loss\nas a result of our involvement with these VIEs\nis the carrying value of the MSRs and\ninvestment securities on our consolidated\nbalance sheets as well as our contractual\nobligations under loss sharing arrangements.\nSee \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d\nfor information related to our MSRs associated\nwith these securitizations and \u201cNote\n2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for more information\non the securities held in our investment\nsecurities portfolio. In addition, where we\nhave certain lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business with entities that\ncould be VIEs, we have also excluded these\nVIEs from the tables presented in this note.\nSee \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for additional information\nregarding our lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business.\n                                              \n  159    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe table below presents our continuing\ninvolvement in certain securitization-related\nVIEs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 5.2: Continuing Involvement in\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       C\u2026                                  \n  \u2026       C\u2026           Au\u2026           Mo\u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        $  2,\u2026        $  790      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       2\u2026           2,\u2026           793      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        0            10            15      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026           Y\u2026            Y\u2026            Y\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026           Y\u2026            Y\u2026            No  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  1\u2026        $  2,\u2026        $  962      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       3\u2026           2,\u2026           978      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        0             7            17      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026           Y\u2026            Y\u2026            Y\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026           Y\u2026            Y\u2026            No  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \nCredit Card Securitizations\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card\nloans which provides a source of funding for\nus. Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritization involves the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nMortgage Securitizations\nWe had previously securitized mortgage loans\nby transferring these loans to securitization\ntrusts that had issued mortgage-backed\nsecurities to investors. These mortgage trusts\nconsist of option-adjustable rate mortgage\n(\u201coption-ARM\u201d) securitizations and\nsecuritizations from our discontinued\noperations which include the mortgage\norigination operations of our wholesale\nmortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage\nFunding, Inc. (\u201cGreenPoint\u201d) and the\nmanufactured housing operations of GreenPoint\nCredit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint\n(collectively \u201cGreenPoint securitizations\u201d).\nWe retain rights to certain future cash flows\narising from these securitizations. We do not\nconsolidate the mortgage securitizations\nbecause we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of the trusts, and the\nright to receive the benefits or the\nobligation to absorb losses that could\npotentially be significant to the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain of our investments in\n                                              \n  160    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nqualified affordable housing projects using\nthe proportional amortization method if\ncertain criteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the year ended December 31,\n2020 and 2019, we recognized amortization of $\n556million and $ 554million, respectively, and\ntax credits of $ 607million and $ 610million,\nrespectively, associated with these\ninvestments within income tax provision or\nbenefit. The carrying value of our equity\ninvestments in these qualified affordable\nhousing projects was $ 4.5billion and $\n4.4billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. We are periodically required to\nprovide additional financial or other support\nduring the period of the investments. Our\nliability for these unfunded commitments was $\n1.5billion as of both December 31, 2020 and\n2019, and is largely expected to be paid from\n2021 to 2023.\n\nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.6billion as of both December 31, 2020 and\n2019. The creditors of the VIEs have no\nrecourse to our general credit and we do not\nprovide additional financial or other support\nother than during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n11.0billion and $ 10.9billion as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.0billion and $ 1.9billion as\nof December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively,\nare reflected on our consolidated balance\nsheets in cash, loans held for investment, and\nother assets. The liabilities are reflected in\nother liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs\nhave no recourse to our general credit. We\nhave not provided additional financial or\nother support other than during the period\nthat we are contractually required to provide\nit.\n\nOther\n\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We were not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance. Our maximum exposure to these\nVIEs is limited to the investments on our\nconsolidated balance sheets of $ 436million\nand $ 502million as of December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively.

An impairment of a\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is determined based\non the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value exceeds its fair value, limited\nto the amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit.\n\nThe fair value of reporting units is\ncalculated using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology, a form of the income approach.\nThe calculation uses projected cash flows\nbased on each reporting unit\u2019s internal\nforecast and uses the perpetuity growth method\nto calculate terminal values. These cash flows\nand terminal values are then discounted using\nappropriate discount rates, which are largely\nbased on our external cost of equity with\nadjustments for risk inherent in each\nreporting unit. Capital is allocated based on\neach reporting unit\u2019s specific regulatory\ncapital requirements, economic capital\nrequirements, and underlying risks.\nConsolidated stockholder\u2019s equity in excess of\nthe sum of all reporting unit\u2019s capital\nrequirements that is not identified for future\ncapital needs, such as dividends, share\nbuybacks, or other strategic initiatives, is\nallocated to the reporting units and Other\ncategory and assumed distributed to equity\nholders in future periods. Our discounted cash\nflow analysis requires management to make\njudgments about future loan and deposit\ngrowth, revenue growth, credit losses, and\ncapital rates. The reasonableness of our fair\nvalue calculation is assessed by reference to\na market-based approach using comparable\nmarket multiples and recent market\ntransactions where available.\n                                              \n  163    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nIntangible Assets\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we\nrecorded intangible assets including PCCRs,\nsponsorships, customer and merchant\nrelationships, partnerships, trade names and\nother contract intangibles.

A majority of our\nleases are operating leases of office space,\nretail bank branches and Caf\u00e9s. For real\nestate leases, we have elected to account for\nthe lease and non-lease components together as\na single lease component. Our operating leases\nexpire at various dates through 2071, and many\nof them require variable lease payments by us,\nof property taxes, insurance premiums, common\narea maintenance and other costs. Certain of\nthese leases also have extension or\ntermination options, and we assess the\nlikelihood of exercising such options. If it\nis reasonably certain that we will exercise\nthe options, then we include the impact in the\nmeasurement of our right-of-use assets and\nlease liabilities.\nOur right-of-use assets and lease liabilities\nfor operating leases are included in other\nassetsand other liabilitieson our consolidated\nbalance sheets. As most of our operating\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, we use\nour incremental borrowing rate in determining\nthe present value of lease payments. Our\noperating lease expense is included in\noccupancy and equipment within non-interest\nexpense in our consolidated statements of\nincome. Total operating lease expense consists\nof operating lease cost, which is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term,\nand variable lease cost, which is recognized\nbased on actual amounts incurred. We also\nsublease certain premises, and sublease income\nis included in other non-interest income in\nour consolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables present information about\nour operating lease portfolio and the related\nlease costs as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.\nTable 7.2 Operating Lease Portfolio\n                                              \n

overall risk\nmanagement activities. Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency derivatives to hedge, but we\nmay also use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We then enter\ninto derivative contracts with counterparties\nto economically hedge substantially all of our\nsubsequent exposures.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of AOCI. Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the forecasted transactions\nimpact earnings and presented in the same line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income\nas the earnings effect of the hedged items.\nOur cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps\nand floors that are intended to hedge the\nvariability in interest receipts or interest\npayments on some of our variable-rate\nfinancial assets or liabilities. We also enter\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  169    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that arises from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in OTC markets.\nWe also execute interest rate and commodity\nfutures in the exchange-traded derivative\nmarkets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both\ntrades cleared through central counterparty\nclearinghouses (\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared\nbilateral contracts. The Chicago Mercantile\nExchange (\u201cCME\u201d) and the LCH Group (\u201cLCH\u201d) are\nour CCPs in our centrally cleared contracts.\nIn our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter\ninto agreements directly with our derivative\ncounterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements, where possible, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. The amount of collateral\nexchanged is dependent upon the fair value of\nthe derivative instruments as well as the fair\nvalue of the pledged collateral and will vary\nover time as market variables change. When\nvaluing collateral, an estimate of the\nvariation in price and liquidity over time is\nsubtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d to\ndiscount the value of the collateral pledged.\nOur exposure to derivative counterparty credit\nrisk, at any point in time, is equal to the\namount reported as a derivative asset on our\nbalance sheet. The fair value of our\nderivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis\nto take into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand any associated cash collateral received or\npledged. See Table 9.3 for our net exposure\nassociated with derivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. Futures commission merchants\n(\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the intermediary between\nCCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial\nand variation margin through our FCMs to\nmitigate the risk of non-payment or default.\nInitial margin is required upfront by CCPs as\ncollateral against potential losses on our\ncleared derivative contracts and variation\nmargin is exchanged on a daily basis to\naccount for mark-to-market changes in those\nderivative contracts. For CME and LCH-cleared\nOTC derivatives, we characterize variation\nmargin cash payments as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand collateral agreements, where possible,\nwith bilateral derivative counterparties to\nmitigate the risk of default. We review our\ncollateral positions on a daily basis and\nexchange collateral with our counterparties in\naccordance with these agreements. These\nbilateral agreements typically provide the\nright to offset exposure with the same\ncounterparty and require the party in a net\nliability position to post collateral.\nAgreements with certain bilateral\ncounterparties require both parties to\nmaintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of derivative instruments exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty. We also\nrecord debit valuation adjustments (\u201cDVAs\u201d) to\nadjust the fair values of our derivative\nliabilities to reflect the impact of our own\ncredit quality.\n                                              \n  170    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nBalance Sheet Presentation\nThe following table summarizes the notional\namounts and fair values of our derivative\ninstruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nwhich are segregated by derivatives that are\ndesignated as accounting hedges and those that\nare not, and are further segregated by type of\ncontract within those two categories.

                               \nRegulation and Capital Adequacy\nBank holding companies (\u201cBHCs\u201d) and national\nbanks are subject to capital adequacy\nstandards adopted by the Federal Reserve,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(\u201cOCC\u201d) and Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (collectively, the \u201cFederal\nBanking Agencies\u201d), including rules of the\nFederal Reserve and the OCC \u201cBasel III Capital\nRules\u201d to implement certain capital liquidity\nrequirements published by the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision, along with certain\nDodd-Frank Act and other provisions. Moreover,\nthe Banks, as insured depository institutions,\nare subject to prompt corrective action\n(\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations, which require the\nFederal Banking Agencies to take prompt\ncorrective action for banks that do not meet\nPCA capital requirements.\nIn July 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies\nfinalized certain changes to the Basel III\nCapital Rules for institutions not subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches (\u201cCapital\nSimplification Rule\u201d). These changes,\neffective January 1, 2020, generally raised\nthe threshold above which a covered\ninstitution such as the Company must deduct\ncertain assets from its common equity Tier 1\ncapital, including certain deferred tax\nassets, mortgage servicing assets, and\ninvestments in unconsolidated financial\ninstitutions.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies\namended the Basel III Capital Rules to provide\nfor tailored application of certain capital\nrequirements across different categories of\nbanking institutions (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). As a\nBHC with total consolidated assets of at least\n$250 billion that does not exceed any of the\napplicable risk-based thresholds, we are a\nCategory III institution under the Tailoring\nRules. As such, we are no longer subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches and certain\nassociated capital requirements and have the\noption of excluding certain elements of AOCI\nfrom our regulatory capital. Effective in the\nfirst quarter of 2020, we excluded certain\nelements of AOCI from our regulatory capital\nas permitted by the Tailoring Rules. The\nTailoring Rules and Capital Simplification\nRule have, taken together, decreased our\ncapital requirements.\nAs part of their response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted\nthe 2020 CECL Transition Rule which provides\nbanking institutions an optional five-year\ntransition period to phase in the impact of\nthe CECL standard on their regulatory capital.\nPursuant to the 2020 CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution may elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies use a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions are permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. Beginning January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year.

COMPENSATION PLANS  \n                                          \nStock Plans\nWe have oneactive stock-based compensation\nplan available for the issuance of shares to\nemployees, directors and third-party service\nproviders (if applicable). As of December 31,\n2020, under the Amended and Restated 2004\nStock Incentive plan (\u201c2004 Plan\u201d), we are\nauthorized to issue 55million common shares in\nvarious forms, primarily share-settled\nrestricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), performance\nshare units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), and non-qualified stock\noptions. Of this amount, approximately\n7million shares remain available for future\nissuance as of December 31, 2020. The 2004\nPlan permits the use of newly issued shares or\ntreasury shares upon the settlement of options\nand stock-based incentive awards, and we\ngenerally settle by issuing new shares.\nWe also issue cash-settled restricted stock\nunits. These cash-settled units are not\ncounted against the common shares authorized\nfor issuance or available for issuance under\nthe 2004 Plan. Cash-settled units vesting\nduring 2020, 2019 and 2018 resulted in cash\npayments to associates of $ 12million, $\n15million and $ 39million, respectively. There\nwas no unrecognized compensation cost for\nunvested cash-settled units as of December 31,\n2020.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\nrecognized during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n203million, $ 239million and $ 170million,\nrespectively. The total income tax benefit for\nstock-based compensation recognized during\n2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 43million, $\n50million and $ 34million, respectively.\nIn addition, we maintain an Associate Stock\nPurchase Plan (\u201cPurchase Plan\u201d), which is a\ncompensatory plan under the accounting\nguidance for stock-based compensation. Related\nto the Purchase Plan, we recognized\ncompensation expense of $ 30million, $\n25million and $ 23million for 2020, 2019 and\n2018, respectively. We also maintain a\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan\n(\u201cDRP\u201d), which allows participating\nstockholders to purchase additional shares of\nour common stock through automatic\nreinvestment of dividends or optional cash\ninvestments.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Share\nUnits\nRSUs represent share-settled awards that do\nnot contain performance conditions and are\ngranted to certain employees at no cost to the\nrecipient. RSUs generally vest over three\nyearsfrom the date of grant; however, some\nRSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the first\nor third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs\nare subject to forfeiture until certain\nrestrictions have lapsed, including continued\nemployment for a specified period of time.\nPSUs represent share-settled awards that\ncontain performance conditions and are granted\nto certain employees at no cost to the\nrecipient. PSUs generally vest over three\nyearsfrom the date of grant; however, some\nPSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the third\nanniversary of the grant date. The number of\nPSUs that step vest over three years can be\nreduced by 50% or 100% depending on whether\nspecific performance goals are met during the\nvesting period. The number of three-year cliff\nvesting PSUs that will ultimately vest is\ncontingent upon meeting specific performance\ngoals over a three-year period. These PSUs\nalso include an opportunity to receive from 0%\nto 150% of the target number of common shares.\nA recipient of an RSU or PSU is entitled to\nreceive a share of common stock after the\napplicable restrictions lapse and is generally\nentitled to receive cash payments or\nadditional shares of common stock equivalent\nto any dividends paid on the underlying common\nstock during the period the RSU or PSU is\noutstanding, but is not entitled to voting\nrights. Generally, the value of RSUs and PSUs\nwill equal the fair value of our common stock\non the date of grant and the expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period. Certain\nPSUs have discretionary vesting conditions and\nare remeasured at fair value each reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  185    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe following table presents a summary of 2020\nactivity for RSUs and PSUs.\nTable 13.1: Summary of Restricted Stock Units\nand Performance Share Units\n                                              \n                    Wei\u2026               Weig\u2026  \n                    Gra\u2026               Grant  \n                    Date                Date  \n         Res\u2026       Fair    Per\u2026        Fair  \n  (S\u2026    Sto\u2026       Val\u2026    Sha\u2026       Value  \n  in     Uni\u2026        per    Uni\u2026         per  \n  th\u2026    Uni\u2026       Unit    Uni\u2026        Unit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Un\u2026                                         \n  as                                          \n  of     3,6\u2026    $  84.\u2026    1,7\u2026    $  89.95  \n  Ja\u2026                                         \n  1,                                          \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Gr\u2026    1,8\u2026       92.\u2026     988       100.\u2026  \n  Ve\u2026    -1,\u2026       89.\u2026    -855       88.19  \n  Fo\u2026    -165       90.\u2026    -147       93.76  \n  Un\u2026                                         \n  as                                          \n  of     3,8\u2026    $  86.\u2026    1,7\u2026    $  96.15  \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,                                         \n  20\u2026                                         \n                                              \n_________\n(1) Granted and vested include adjustments for\nachievement of specific performance goals for\nperformance share units granted in prior\nperiods.\n(2) The weighted-average grant date fair value\nof RSUs was $ 83.29and $ 100.73in 2019 and\n2018, respectively.

Investment\nstrategies and asset allocations are based on\ncareful consideration of plan liabilities, the\nplan\u2019s funded status and our financial\ncondition. Investment performance and asset\nallocation are measured and monitored on a\ndaily basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our plan\nassets totaled $ 280million and $ 260million,\nrespectively. We invested substantially all\nour plan assets in common collective trusts,\nwhich primarily consist of domestic and\ninternational equity securities, government\nsecurities and corporate and municipal bonds.\nOur plan assets were classified as Level 2 in\nthe fair value hierarchy as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019. For information on fair value\nmeasurements, including descriptions of Level\n1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the\nvaluation methods we utilize, see \u201cNote\n16\u2014Fair Value Measurement.\u201d\nExpected Future Benefit Payments\nAs of December 31, 2020, the benefits expected\nto be paid in the next ten years totaled $\n110million for our defined pension benefit\nplans and $ 14million for our other\npostretirement benefit plan, respectively.\n                                              \n  188    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                        \n  NOTE\u00a015\u2014INCOME TAXES  \n                        \nWe recognize the current and deferred tax\nconsequences of all transactions that have\nbeen recognized in the financial statements\nusing the provisions of the enacted tax laws.\nCurrent income tax expense represents our\nestimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period and includes income tax expense\nrelated to our uncertain tax positions, as\nwell as tax-related interest and penalties.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that will be in\neffect when the differences are expected to\nreverse. We record valuation allowances to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. We\nrecord the effect of remeasuring deferred tax\nassets and liabilities due to a change in tax\nrates or laws as a component of income tax\nexpense related to continuing operations for\nthe period in which the change is enacted. We\nsubsequently release income tax effects\nstranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach.\nIncome tax benefits are recognized when, based\non their technical merits, they are more\nlikely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination. The amount recognized is the\nlargest amount of benefit that is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement.\nThe following table presents significant\ncomponents of the provision for income taxes\nattributable to continuing operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 15.1: Significant Components of the\nProvision for Income Taxes Attributable to\nContinuing Operations\n                                              \n                Year                          \n               Ended                          \n  (Dol\u2026       Decem\u2026                          \n  in             31,                          \n  mill\u2026         2020        2019        2018  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Curr\u2026                                       \n  inco\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026    $   1,676    $  1,207    $    210  \n  taxes                                       \n  State          370         301         234  \n  taxes                                       \n  Inte\u2026           67         129         135  \n  taxes                                       \n  Total                                       \n  curr\u2026    $   2,113    $  1,637    $    579  \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  Defe\u2026                                       \n  inco\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  (ben\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026    $  -1,357    $   -222    $    620  \n  taxes                                       \n  State         -266         -45         115  \n  taxes                                       \n  Inte\u2026           -4         -29         -21  \n  taxes                                       \n  Total                                       \n  defe\u2026       -1,627        -296         714  \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  (ben\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  inco\u2026    $     486    $  1,341    $  1,293  \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n                                              \nThe international income tax provision is\nrelated to pre-tax earnings from foreign\noperations of approximately $ 293million, $\n215million and $ 382million in 2020, 2019 and\n2018, respectively.\nTotal income tax provision does not reflect\nthe tax effects of items that are included in\nAOCI, which include tax provisions of $\n702million, $ 727million and $ 15million in\n2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

These operating loss\ncarryforwards were attributable to\nacquisitions and will expire from 2028 to\n2037, though $ 26million has no expiration.\nUnder IRS rules, our ability to utilize these\nlosses against future income is limited. The\nnet tax value of our state net operating loss\ncarryforwards were $ 250million and $\n237million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, and they will expire from 2021\nto 2040. Our foreign tax credit carryforward\nwas $ 56million and $ 40million as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This\ncarryforward will begin expiring in 2028.\n\nOur valuation allowance increased by $\n73million to $ 296million as of December 31,\n2020 compared to $ 223million as of December\n31, 2019. Of the total increase, $ 56million\nis due to the determination that our foreign\ntax credit carryforwards will not be fully\nrealized prior to expiration. The remaining\nincrease relates to current year increments\nfor state net operating loss and interest\ncarryforwards.\n\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties\nrelated to income taxes as a component of\nincome tax expense. We recognized $ 16million,\n$ 4million and $ 6million of such expense in\n2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table presents the accrued\nbalance of tax, interest and penalties

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following describes the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nInvestment Securities\nWe measure the fair value of our U.S. Treasury\nsecurities using quoted prices in active\nmarkets. For the majority of securities in\nother investment categories, we utilize\nmultiple vendor pricing services to obtain\nfair value measurements. We use a waterfall of\npricing vendors determined using our annual\nassessment of pricing service performance. A\npricing service may be considered as the\npreferred or primary pricing provider\ndepending on how closely aligned its prices\nare to other vendor prices, and how consistent\nthe prices are with other available market\ninformation. The price of each security is\nconfirmed by comparing with other vendor\nprices before it is finalized.\nRMBS and CMBS are generally classified as\nLevel 2 or 3. When significant assumptions are\nnot consistently observable, fair values are\nderived using the best available data. Such\ndata may include quotes provided by dealers,\nvaluation from external pricing services,\nindependent pricing models, or other model-\nbased valuation techniques, for example,\ncalculation of the present values of future\ncash flows incorporating assumptions such as\nbenchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds,\ncredit ratings and losses. Generally, the\npricing services utilize observable market\ndata to the extent available. Pricing models\nmay be used, which can vary by asset class and\nmay also incorporate available trade, bid and\nother market information. Across asset\nclasses, information such as trader/dealer\ninputs, credit spreads, forward curves and\nprepayment speeds are used to help determine\nappropriate valuations. Because many fixed\nincome securities do not trade on a daily\nbasis, the pricing models may apply available\ninformation through processes such as\nbenchmarking curves, grouping securities based\non their characteristics and using matrix\npricing to prepare valuations. In addition,\nmodel processes are used by the pricing\nservices to develop prepayment assumptions.\nWe validate the pricing obtained from the\nprimary pricing providers through comparison\nof pricing to additional sources, including\nother pricing services, dealer pricing\nindications in transaction results and other\ninternal sources. Pricing variances among\ndifferent pricing sources are analyzed.\nAdditionally, on an on-going basis, we request\nmore detailed information from the valuation\nvendors to understand the pricing methodology\nand assumptions used to value the securities.\n                                              \n  193    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nWe use both exchange-traded and OTC\nderivatives to manage our interest rate,\nforeign currency and commodity risk exposures.\nWhen quoted market prices are available and\nused to value our exchange-traded derivatives,\nwe classify them as Level 1. However, the\nmajority of our derivatives do not have\nreadily available quoted market prices.\nTherefore, we value most of our derivatives\nusing vendor-based models. We primarily rely\non market observable inputs for these models,\nincluding, for example, interest rate yield\ncurves, credit curves, option volatility and\ncurrency rates. These inputs can vary\ndepending on the type of derivatives and\nnature of the underlying rate, price or index\nupon which the value of the derivative is\nbased. We typically classify derivatives as\nLevel 2 when significant inputs can be\nobserved in a liquid market and the model\nitself does not require significant judgment.\nWhen instruments are traded in less liquid\nmarkets and significant inputs are\nunobservable, such as interest rate swaps\nwhose remaining terms do not correlate with\nmarket observable interest rate yield curves,\nsuch derivatives are classified as Level 3. We\nconsider the impact of credit risk valuation\nadjustments when measuring the fair value of\nderivative contracts in order to reflect the\ncredit quality of the counterparty and our own\ncredit quality. Official internal pricing is\ncompared against additional pricing sources\nsuch as external valuation agents and other\ninternal sources. Pricing variances among\ndifferent pricing sources are analyzed and\nvalidated. These derivatives are included in\nother assets or other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nLoans Held for Sale\nIn our commercial business, we originate\nmultifamily commercial real estate loans with\nthe intent to sell them to GSEs. Beginning in\nthe fourth quarter of 2019, we elected the\nfair value option for such loans as part of\nour management of interest rate risk in our\nmultifamily agency business. These held for\nsale loans are valued based on market\nobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nas Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses on\nthese loans are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nRetained Interests in Securitizations\nWe have retained interests in various mortgage\nsecuritizations from previous acquisitions.\nOur retained interests primarily include\ninterest-only bonds and negative amortization\nbonds. We record these retained interests at\nfair value using market indications and\nvaluation models to calculate the present\nvalue of future cash flows. The models\nincorporate various assumptions that market\nparticipants use in estimating future cash\nflows including voluntary prepayment rate,\ndiscount rate, default rate and loss severity.\nDue to the use of significant unobservable\ninputs, retained interests in securitizations\nare classified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Assets\nWe offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan to eligible associates. In\naddition to participant deferrals, we make\ncontributions to the plan. Participants invest\nthese contributions in a variety of publicly\ntraded mutual funds. The plan assets, which\nconsist of publicly traded mutual funds, are\nclassified as Level 1.\n\nThe determination of the leveling of financial\ninstruments in the fair value hierarchy is\nperformed at the end of each reporting period.\nWe consider all available information,\nincluding observable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and\nsignificant inputs. Based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or\ninstrument category, judgments are made\nregarding the significance of the observable\nor unobservable inputs to the instruments\u2019\nfair value measurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity\nand credit spreads, in isolation, would result\nin a decrease in the fair value measurement.\nIn addition, an increase in default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by a decrease\nin recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and\nan increase in liquidity spreads.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements\n\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

significant unobservable inputs.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe are required to measure and recognize\ncertain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThese assets are not measured at fair value on\nan ongoing basis but are subject to fair value\nadjustments in certain circumstances (for\nexample, from the application of lower of cost\nor fair value accounting or when we evaluate\nfor impairment). The following describes the\nvaluation techniques used in estimating the\nfair value of our financial assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis.\nNet Loans Held for Investment\nFor loans held for investment that are\nrecorded at fair value on our consolidated\nbalance sheets and measured on a nonrecurring\nbasis, the fair value is determined using\nappraisal values that are obtained from\nindependent appraisers, broker pricing\nopinions or other available market\ninformation, adjusted for the estimated cost\nto sell. Due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs, these loans are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy. Fair value adjustments for\nindividually impaired collateralized loans\nheld for investment are recorded in provision\nfor credit losses in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\n                                              \n  198    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale for which we have not\nelected the fair value option are carried at\nthe lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred\nfees and deferred origination costs, or fair\nvalue. These loans held for sale are valued\nbased on market observable inputs and are\ntherefore classified as Level 2. Fair value\nadjustments to these loans are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income.\nOther Assets\nOther assets subject to nonrecurring fair\nvalue measurements include equity investments\naccounted for under the measurement\nalternative, other repossessed assets and\nlong-lived assets held for sale. These assets\nheld for sale are carried at the lower of the\ncarrying amount or fair value less costs to\nsell. The fair value is determined based on\nthe appraisal value, listing price of the\nproperty or collateral provided by independent\nappraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated\ncosts to sell. Due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs, these assets are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy. Fair value adjustments for these\nassets are recorded in other non-interest\nexpense in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe following table presents the carrying\nvalue of the assets measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and still held as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, and for which a\nnonrecurring fair value measurement was\nrecorded during the year then ended.\nTable 16.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value\nMeasurements\n                                              \n              Dece\u2026                           \n                31,                           \n               2020                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n              Esti\u2026                           \n               Fair                    Total  \n              Value                           \n              Hier\u2026                           \n  (Dol\u2026       Level        Level              \n  in              2            3              \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held     $      0    $     305    $    305  \n  for                                         \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Other           0          175         175  \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total    $      0    $     480    $    480  \n                                              \n                                              \n              Dece\u2026                           \n                31,                           \n               2019                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n              Esti\u2026                           \n               Fair                    Total  \n              Value                           \n              Hier\u2026                           \n  (Dol\u2026       Level        Level              \n  in              2            3              \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held     $      0    $     294    $    294  \n  for                                         \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Other           0          103         103  \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total    $      0    $     397    $    397  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) As of December 31, 2020, other assets\nincluded equity investments accounted for\nunder the measurement al ternative of $\n25million, repossessed assets of $ 42million\nand long-lived assets held for sale of $\n108million.

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a segment, such as management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio,\nasset/liability management by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and residual tax\nexpense or benefit to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate that is not\nassessed to our primary business segments, are\nincluded in the Other category.\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom.\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our commercial and industrial\ncustomers typically include companies with\nannual revenues between $ 20million and $\n2billion.\n\u2022 Other category: Includes the residual impact\nof the allocation of our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group activities, such as management\nof our corporate investment portfolio and\nasset/liability management, to our business\nsegments. Accordingly, net gains and losses on\nour investment securities portfolio and\ncertain trading activities are included in the\nOther category. Other category also includes\nforeign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign\ncurrency-denominated transactions; unallocated\ncorporate expenses that do not directly\nsupport the operations of the business\nsegments or for which the business segments\nare not considered financially accountable in\nevaluating their performance, such as certain\nrestructuring charges; certain material items\nthat are non-recurring in nature; offsets\nrelated to certain line-item\nreclassifications; and residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess provides a funds credit for sources of\nfunds, such as deposits generated by our\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a funds charge for the use of\nfunds by each segment. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate third-party rates. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.\nThe following is additional information on the\nprinciples and methodologies used in preparing\nour business segment results.\n\u2022 Net interest income: Interest income from\nloans held for investment and interest expense\nfrom deposits and other interest-bearing\nliabilities are reflected within each\napplicable business segment. Because funding\nand asset/liability management are managed\ncentrally by our Corporate Treasury group, net\ninterest income for our business segments also\nincludes the results of a funds transfer\npricing process that is intended to allocate a\ncost of funds used or credit for funds\nprovided to all business segment assets and\nliabilities, respectively, using a matched\nfunding concept. The taxable-equivalent\nbenefit of tax-exempt products is also\nallocated to each business unit with a\ncorresponding increase in income tax expense.\n                                              \n  202    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n\u2022 Non-interest income: Non-interest fees and\nother revenue associated with loans or\ncustomers managed by each business segment and\nother direct revenues are accounted for within\neach business segment.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses: The provision\nfor credit losses is directly attributable to\nthe business segment in accordance with the\nloans each business segment manages.\n\n\u2022 Non-interest expense: Non-interest expenses\ndirectly managed and incurred by a business\nsegment are accounted for within each business\nsegment. We allocate certain non-interest\nexpenses indirectly incurred by business\nsegments, such as corporate support functions,\nto each business segment based on various\nfactors, including the actual cost of the\nservices from the service providers, the\nutilization of the services, the number of\nemployees or other relevant factors.\n\n\u2022 Goodwill and intangible assets: Goodwill and\nintangible assets that are not directly\nattributable to business segments are assigned\nto business segments based on the relative\nfair value of each segment. Intangible\namortization is included in the results of the\napplicable segment.\n\n\u2022 Income taxes: Income taxes are assessed for\neach business segment based on a standard tax\nrate with the residual tax expense or benefit\nto arrive at the consolidated effective tax\nrate included in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Loans held for investment: Loans are\nreported within each business segment based on\nproduct or customer type served by that\nbusiness segment.\n\n\u2022 Deposits: Deposits are reported within each\nbusiness segment based on product or customer\ntype served by that business segment.\nSegment Results and Reconciliation\nWe may periodically change our business\nsegments or reclassify business segment\nresults based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies or changes\nin organizational alignment. In the first\nquarter of 2019, we made a change in how\nrevenue is measured in our Commercial Banking\nbusiness by revising the allocation of tax\nbenefits on certain tax-advantaged\ninvestments. As such, 2018 results have been\nrecast to conform with the current period\npresentation. The result of this measurement\nchange reduced the previously reported total\nnet revenue in our Commercial Banking business\nby $ 108million for the year ended December\n31, 2018, with an offsetting increase in the\nOther category. This change in measurement of\nour Commercial Banking revenue did not have\nany impact to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n\nThe following table presents our business\nsegment results for the years ended December\n31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, selected balance\nsheet data as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and\n2018, and a reconciliation of our total\nbusiness segment results to our reported\nconsolidated income from continuing\noperations, loans held for investment and\ndeposits.\n                                              \n  203    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n

Accordingly, we present\nour Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a\ntaxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the\nfederal statutory tax rate of (21% for all\nperiods presented) and state taxes where\napplicable, with offsetting reductions to the\nOther category.\n\n(2) Total net revenue was reduced by $\n1.1billion for the year ended December 31,\n2020, for finance charges and fees charged off\nas uncollectible.\n\n(3) In the first quarter of 2019, we made a\nchange in how revenue is measured in our\nCommercial Banking business by revising the\nallocation of tax benefits on certain tax-\nadvantaged investments. As such, 2018 results\nhave been recast to conform with the current\nperiod presentation. The result of this\nmeasurement change reduced the previously\nreported total net revenue in our Commercial\nBanking business by $ 108million for the year\nended December 31, 2018, with an offsetting\nincrease in the Other category.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe majority of our revenue from contracts\nwith customers consists of interchange fees,\nservice charges and other customer-related\nfees, and other contract revenue. Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as overdrafts and ATM\nusage. Service charges and other customer-\nrelated fees within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness are mostly related to fees earned on\ntreasury management and capital markets\nservices. Other contract revenue in our Credit\nCard business consists primarily of revenue\nfrom our partnership arrangements. Other\ncontract revenue in our Consumer Banking\nbusiness consists primarily of revenue earned\non certain marketing and promotional events\nfrom our auto dealers. Revenue from contracts\nwith customers is included in non-interest\nincome in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe following table presents revenue from\ncontracts with customers and a reconciliation\nto non-interest income by business segment for\nthe years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and\n2018.\nTable 17.2: Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers and Reconciliation to Segment\nResults\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -2    $  \u2026  \n         0       1\u2026       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         \u2026       39       4        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       -3       \u2026  \n         \u2026       30       \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -6    $  \u2026  \n         0       2\u2026       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       3        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       6\u2026       \u2026       -7       \u2026  \n         \u2026       39       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  6\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  205    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -4    $  \u2026  \n         0       3\u2026       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         8       1\u2026       2        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       6\u2026       \u2026       -5       \u2026  \n         \u2026        2       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  6\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Some of our commercial investments\ngenerate tax-exempt income, tax credits or\nother tax benefits.

The contractual amount of these\ncommitments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to us should the counterparty draw\nupon the commitment. We generally manage the\npotential risk of unfunded lending commitments\nby limiting the total amount of arrangements,\nmonitoring the size and maturity structure of\nthese portfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of December 31, 2020\nand 2019.

We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of the loans.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair\nvalue option on new loss sharing agreements.\nUnrealized gains and losses are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income. For those loss sharing\nagreements entered into as of and prior to\nDecember 31, 2019, we amortize the liability\nrecorded at inception into non-interest income\nas we are released from risk of payment under\nthe loss sharing agreement and record our\nestimate of expected credit losses each period\nin provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The\nliability recognized on our consolidated\nbalance sheets for these loss sharing\nagreements was $ 97million and $ 75million as\nof December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSee \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and\nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for\nmore information related to our credit card\npartnership loss sharing arrangements.\n                                              \n  207    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nU.K. Payment Protection Insurance\n\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). In response to\nan elevated level of customer complaints\nacross the industry, heightened media coverage\nand pressure from consumer advocacy groups,\nthe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d),\nformerly the Financial Services Authority,\ninvestigated and raised concerns about the way\nthe industry has handled complaints related to\nthe sale of these insurance policies. For the\npast several years, the U.K.\u2019s Financial\nOmbudsman Service (\u201cFOS\u201d) has been\nadjudicating customer complaints relating to\nPPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree\nwith the rejection of their complaint by\nfirms, leading to customer remediation\npayments by us and others within the industry.\nIn August 2017, the FCA issued final rules and\nguidance on the PPI complaints. This set the\ndeadline for complaints as August 29, 2019. It\nalso provided clarity on how to handle PPI\ncomplaints under s.140A of the Consumer Credit\nAct, including guidance on how redress for\nsuch complaints should be calculated.\n\nCOEP has now materially completed the handling\nof PPI complaints that were received prior to\nthe deadline set by the FCA. Escalations to\nthe FOS (by customers or their\nrepresentatives) may still take place until\nthe first quarter of 2021. Throughout this\ntime, the FCA will continue to supervise firms\nthat handle PPI complaints and the supporting\nprocesses, people and systems.\n\nOur U.K. PPI reserve declined to an immaterial\namount as of December 31, 2020 from $\n188million as of December 31, 2019.\nLitigation\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for litigation-related matters that\narise from the ordinary course of our business\nactivities when it is probable that a loss\nassociated with a claim or proceeding has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2020 are approximately $\n200million. Our reserve and reasonably\npossible loss estimates involve considerable\njudgment and reflect that there is still\nsignificant uncertainty regarding numerous\nfactors that may impact the ultimate loss\nlevels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlitigation matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and the range of reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed here. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in these matters,\nespecially those involving governmental\nagencies, and the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these matters, there\nis significant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these litigation\nmatters and an adverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be material to our\nresults of operations or cash flows for any\nparticular reporting period.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds\n                                              \n  208    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nsettlements for its member banks, and any\nsettlements related to MasterCard-allocated\nlosses have either already been paid or are\nreflected in our reserves.\nAnti-Money Laundering\nIn October 2018, we paid a civil monetary\npenalty of $ 100million to resolve the\nmonetary component of a July 2015 OCC consent\norder relating to our anti-money laundering\n(\u201cAML\u201d) program. The OCC lifted the AML\nconsent order in November 2019.\n\nIn June 2019, the Department of Justice and\nthe New York District Attorney\u2019s Office closed\ntheir investigations into certain former check\ncashing clients of the Commercial Banking\nbusiness and our AML program. In January 2021,\nthe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Treasury\nassessed a civil monetary penalty of $\n390million to conclude its investigation into\nAML compliance regarding certain former check\ncashing clients. We paid $ 290million from\nexisting reserves to satisfy the assessment,\nafter receiving a credit for the related $\n100million civil monetary penalty we paid to\nthe OCC in October 2018. The resolution with\nFinCEN concludes the last government inquiry\nrelating to the former check cashing line of\nbusiness we exited in 2014.\nCybersecurity Incident\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident\nannounced on July 29, 2019, we are subject to\nnumerous legal proceedings and other inquiries\nand could be the subject of additional\nproceedings and inquiries in the future.\n\nConsumer class actions . We were named as a\ndefendant in approximately 73putative consumer\nclass action cases ( 61in U.S. federal courts\nand 12in Canadian courts) alleging harm from\nthe Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various\nremedies, including monetary and injunctive\nrelief. The lawsuits allege breach of\ncontract, negligence, violations of various\nprivacy laws and a variety of other legal\ncauses of action. The U.S. consumer class\nactions have been consolidated for pretrial\nproceedings before a multi-district litigation\n(\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria\nDivision, where the remaining 29consumer class\nactions are currently pending. In the third\nquarter of 2020, the MDL court denied in part\nand granted in part Capital One\u2019s motion to\ndismiss and permitted pretrial discovery to\ncontinue.\n\nSecurities class action . The Company and\ncertain officers have also been named as\ndefendants in a putative class action pending\nin the MDL alleging violations of certain\nfederal securities laws in connection with\nstatements and alleged omissions in securities\nfilings relating to our information security\nstandards and practices. The complaint seeks\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief.\n\nGovernmental inquiries . We have received\ninquiries and requests for information\nrelating to the Cybersecurity Incident from\nCongress, federal regulators, relevant\nCanadian regulators, the Department of\nJustice, and the offices of approximately\nfourteen state Attorneys General. We are\ncooperating with these offices and responding\nto their inquiries.\n\nIn August 2020, we entered into consent orders\nwith the Federal Reserve and the OCC resulting\nfrom regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity\nIncident and relating to ongoing enhancements\nof our cybersecurity and operational risk\nmanagement processes. We paid an $ 80million\npenalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the\nOCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement\ndid not contain a monetary penalty.\nTaxi Medallion Finance Investigations\nBeginning in 2019, we have received subpoenas\nfrom the New York Attorney General\u2019s office\nand from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nSouthern District of New York, Civil and\nCriminal Divisions, relating to investigations\nof the taxi medallion finance industry we\nexited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek,\namong other things, information regarding our\nlending counterparties and practices. We are\ncooperating with these investigations.\nU.K. PPI Litigation\nSome of the claimants in the U.K. PPI\nregulatory claims process have initiated legal\nproceedings. The significant increase in PPI\nregulatory claim volumes shortly before the\nAugust 29, 2019 claims submission deadline\nincreases the potential exposure for PPI-\nrelated litigation, which is not subject to\nthe August 29, 2019 deadline.\n                                              \n  209    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities.
