 \n                                              \nOn May 24, 2024, Capital One Financial\nCorporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) announced that the\ncredit card partnership agreement (the

Pursuant to the\nterms of the CCPA, Capital One will retain\nownership and servicing of the existing credit\ncard portfolio of approximately $8.5 billion\nof loans. Approximately 40% of the credit card\nloan balances were originated and underwritten\nby Capital One. The Company expects to begin\nconverting eligible customers and integrating\nthe accounts into Capital One branded card\nproducts.\n\nThe CCPA included terms and conditions related\nto revenue sharing and loss sharing associated\nwith the Card Program. As part of the\ntermination, the revenue sharing and loss\nsharing arrangements also terminated.\n\nIf the loss sharing arrangement had not been\nin place for the first quarter of 2024, the\nDomestic Card net charge-off rate would have\nbeen approximately 45 basis points higher and\nour allowance for credit losses would have\nbeen approximately $850 million higher. If the\nrevenue sharing arrangement had not been in\nplace for the first quarter of 2024, Domestic\nCard revenue margin would have been\napproximately 45 basis points higher.\n\nA copy of the joint press release issued by\nthe Company and Walmart is attached as Exhibit\n99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated\nherein by reference.\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward\nLooking Statements\nThe information provided in this Form 8-K\ncontains forward-looking statements, which\ninvolve a number of risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company cautions readers that any forward-\nlooking information is not a guarantee of\nfuture performance and that actual results\ncould differ materially from those contained\nin the forward-looking information due to a\nnumber of factors, including those listed from\ntime to time in reports that the Company files\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding, but not limited to, the Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.
