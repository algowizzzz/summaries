We also earn non-\ninterest income which primarily consists of\ninterchange income, net of reward expenses,\nservice charges and other customer-related\nfees. Our expenses primarily consist of the\nprovision for credit losses, operating\nexpenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customers served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio and asset/liability management by\nour centralized Corporate Treasury group, are\nincluded in the Other category. The Other\ncategory also includes unallocated corporate\nexpenses that do not directly support the\noperations of the business segments or for\nwhich the business segments are not considered\nfinancially accountable in evaluating their\nperformance, such as certain restructuring\ncharges, as well as residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in the United\nKingdom and Canada.\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our customers typically include\ncompanies with annual revenues between $20\nmillion and $2 billion.\n\nCustomer usage and payment patterns, estimates\nof future expected credit losses, levels of\nmarketing expense and operating efficiency all\naffect our profitability. In our Credit Card\nbusiness, we generally experience fluctuations\nin purchase volume and the level of\noutstanding loan receivables from seasonal\nvariances in consumer spending and payment\npatterns which, for example, have historically\nbeen the highest around the winter holiday\nseason. Net charge-off rates for our credit\ncard loan portfolio also have historically\nexhibited seasonal patterns as well and\ngenerally tend to be the highest in the first\nquarter of the year.\n\nFor additional information on our business\nsegments, including the financial performance\nof each business, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n(\u201cMD&A\u201d)\u2014Executive Summary,\u201d \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7.\nMD&A\u2014Business Segment Financial Performance\u201d\nand \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

In\ngeneral, customers are attracted to credit\ncard issuers largely on the basis of price,\ncredit limit, reward programs, customer\nexperience and other product features.\n\nOur Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses compete with national, state and\ndirect banks for deposits, commercial and auto\nloans, as well as with savings and loan\nassociations and credit unions for loans and\ndeposits. Our competitors also include\nautomotive finance companies, commercial\nmortgage banking companies and other financial\nservices providers that provide loans,\ndeposits, and other similar services and\nproducts. In addition, we compete against non-\ndepository institutions that are able to offer\nthese products and services.\n\nWe also consider new and emerging companies in\ndigital and mobile payments and other\nfinancial technology providers among our\ncompetitors. We compete with many forms of\npayment mechanisms, systems and products,\noffered by both bank and non-bank providers.\n\nOur businesses generally compete on the basis\nof the quality and range of their products and\nservices, transaction execution, innovation\nand price. Competition varies based on the\ntypes of clients, customers, industries and\ngeographies served. Our ability to compete\ndepends, in part, on our ability to attract\nand retain our associates and on our\nreputation as well as our ability to keep pace\nwith innovation, in particular in the\ndevelopment of new technology platforms. There\ncan be no assurance, however, that our ability\nto market products and services successfully\nor to obtain adequate returns on our products\nand services will not be impacted by the\nnature of the competition that now exists or\nmay later develop, or by the broader economic\nenvironment.

In\naddition to banking laws and regulations, we\nare subject to various other laws and\nregulations, all of which directly or\nindirectly affect our operations, management\nand ability to make distributions to\nstockholders. We and our subsidiaries are also\nsubject to supervision and examination by\nmultiple regulators. In addition to laws and\nregulations, state and federal bank regulatory\nagencies may issue policy statements,\ninterpretive letters and similar written\nguidance applicable to us and our\nsubsidiaries. Any change in the statutes,\nregulations or regulatory policies applicable\nto us, including changes in their\ninterpretation or implementation, could have a\nmaterial effect on our business or\norganization.\n\nBoth the scope of the laws and regulations and\nthe intensity of the supervision to which we\nare subject have increased, initially in\nresponse to the 2007-2008 financial crisis,\nand more recently in light of other factors\nsuch as technological, political and market\nchanges. Regulatory enforcement and fines have\nalso increased across the banking and\nfinancial services sector.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant federal and state laws, as well as\ninternational laws, to which we are subject.\nThe descriptions are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the particular\nstatutory or regulatory provisions summarized.\nThey do not summarize all possible or proposed\nchanges in current laws or regulations and are\nnot intended to be a substitute for the\nrelated statutes or regulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  Banking Regulation                          \n                                              \nCapital One Financial Corporation is a bank\nholding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d) under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHC Act\u201d),\nand is subject to the requirements of the BHC\nAct, including approval requirements for\ninvestments in or acquisitions of banking\norganizations, capital adequacy standards and\nlimitations\n                                              \n  7    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\non non-banking activities. As a BHC and FHC,\nwe are subject to supervision, examination and\nregulation by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d).\nPermissible activities for a BHC include those\nactivities that are so closely related to\nbanking as to be a proper incident thereto. In\naddition, an FHC is permitted to engage in\nactivities considered to be financial in\nnature (including, for example, securities\nunderwriting and dealing and merchant banking\nactivities), incidental to financial\nactivities or, if the Federal Reserve\ndetermines that they pose no risk to the\nsafety or soundness of depository institutions\nor the financial system in general, activities\ncomplementary to financial activities.\n\nTo become and remain eligible for FHC status,\na BHC and its subsidiary depository\ninstitutions must meet certain criteria,\nincluding capital, management and Community\nReinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. Failure\nto meet such criteria could result, depending\non which requirements were not met, in\nrestrictions on new financial activities or\nacquisitions or being required to discontinue\nexisting activities that are not generally\npermissible for BHCs.\n\nThe Bank is a national association chartered\nunder the National Bank Act, the deposits of\nwhich are insured by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) up to\napplicable limits. The Bank is subject to\ncomprehensive regulation and periodic\nexamination by the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), the FDIC and the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d).\n\nWe also are registered as a financial\ninstitution holding company under the laws of\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia and, as such, we\nare subject to periodic examination by the\nVirginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. We\nalso face regulation in the international\njurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nSee \u201cRegulation of Businesses by Authorities\nOutside the United States\u201d below for\nadditional details.\n                                              \n   Regulation of Business Activities          \n                                              \nThe business activities of the Company and the\nBank are also subject to regulation and\nsupervision under various laws and\nregulations.\n                                              \n  Regulations of Consumer Lending Activities  \n                                              \nThe activities of the Bank as a consumer\nlender are subject to regulation under various\nfederal laws, including, for example, the\nTruth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit\nReporting Act, the CRA, the Servicemembers\nCivil Relief Act and the Military Lending Act,\nas well as under various state laws. TILA, as\namended, and together with its implementing\nrule, Regulation Z, imposes a number of\nrestrictions on credit card practices\nimpacting rates and fees, requires that a\nconsumer\u2019s ability to pay be taken into\naccount before issuing credit or increasing\ncredit limits, and imposes revised disclosures\nrequired for open-end credit.\n\nThe CFPB recently proposed a rule to amend\nRegulation Z (the \u201cProposed CFPB Rule\u201d) to\nlower the safe harbor amount for past due fees\nthat a credit card issuer can charge on\nconsumer credit card accounts below the\namounts that are currently permitted, among\nother changes that could impact the amount of\na past due fee that can be charged.\n\nDepending on the underlying issue and\napplicable law, regulators may be authorized\nto impose penalties for violations of these\nstatutes and, in certain cases, to order banks\nto compensate customers. Borrowers may also\nhave a private right of action for certain\nviolations. Federal bankruptcy and state\ndebtor relief and collection laws may also\naffect the ability of a bank, including the\nBank, to collect outstanding balances owed by\nborrowers.\n\nDebit Card Interchange Fees and Transaction\nProcessing\n\nThe Bank is subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nRegulation II, which limits the amount of\ninterchange fees that can be charged per debit\ncard transaction for debit card issuers with\nover $10 billion in assets and places certain\nprohibitions on payment routing restrictions\nand network exclusivity.\n                                              \n  Privacy, Data Protection and Data Security  \n                                              \nWe are subject to a variety of continuously\nevolving and developing laws and regulations\nregarding privacy, data protection and data\nsecurity, including those related to the\ncollection, storage, handling, use,\ndisclosure, transfer, security and other\nprocessing of personal information. These\nareas have seen a considerable increase in\nlegislative and regulatory activity over the\npast several years. At the federal level, we\nare subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\n(\u201cGLBA\u201d), among other laws and regulations.\nMoreover, the U.S. Congress is currently\nconsidering various proposals for more\ncomprehensive privacy, data\n                                              \n  8    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nprotection and data security legislation, to\nwhich we may be subject if passed. For\nexample, in 2022, Congress and the federal\nagencies sought to institute mandatory\nreporting of cyber incidents that materially\ndisrupt or degrade operations and systems or\nmight otherwise impact U.S. critical\ninfrastructure or national security. This\nresulted in enactment of the Cyber Incident\nReporting for Critical Infrastructure Act\n(\u201cCIRCIA\u201d), which, once rulemaking is\ncomplete, will require, among other things,\ncertain companies, including Capital One, to\nreport significant cyber incidents to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security\u2019s\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency (\u201cCISA\u201d) within 72 hours from the time\nthe company reasonably believes the incident\noccurred, and a proposed rule by the SEC,\nwhich would mandate public disclosure of\nmaterial cybersecurity incidents within four\nbusiness days of determining that such an\nincident has occurred.\n\nAt the state level, we are subject to a number\nof laws and regulations, such as the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act and its\nimplementing regulations (as amended by the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, the \u201cCPRA\u201d),\nwhich creates obligations on covered companies\nto, among other things, share certain\ninformation they have collected about\nCalifornia residents with those individuals,\nsubject to certain exceptions. Many other\nstates also have enacted or are in the process\nof enacting state-level privacy, data\nprotection and/or data security laws and\nregulations, with which we may be required to\ncomply. Significant uncertainty exists as\nfederal and state privacy, data protection and\ndata security laws may be interpreted and\napplied differently and may create\ninconsistent or conflicting requirements. For\nfurther discussion of privacy, data protection\nand cybersecurity, and related risks for our\nbusiness, see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d\nunder the headings \u201c We face risks related to\nour operational, technological and\norganizational infrastructure ,\u201d \u201c A cyber-\nattack or other security incident, including\none that results in the theft, loss,\nmanipulation or misuse of information\n(including personal information), or the\ndisabling of systems and access to information\ncritical to business operations, may result in\nincreased costs, reductions in revenue,\nreputational damage, legal exposure and\nbusiness disruptions . \u201d and \u201c Our required\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations related to privacy, data\nprotection and data security may increase our\ncosts, reduce our revenue, increase our legal\nexposure and limit our ability to pursue\nbusiness opportunities. \u201d\n                                              \n  Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism    \n                                              \nThe Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act\nof 2001 (\u201cPatriot Act\u201d) require financial\ninstitutions, among other things, to implement\na risk-based program reasonably designed to\nprevent money laundering and to combat the\nfinancing of terrorism, including through\nsuspicious activity and currency transaction\nreporting, compliance, record-keeping and\ncustomer due diligence.\n\nThe Patriot Act also contains financial\ntransparency laws and provides enhanced\ninformation collection tools and enforcement\nmechanisms to the U.S. government, including\ndue diligence and record-keeping requirements\nfor private banking and correspondent\naccounts; standards for verifying customer\nidentification at account opening; rules to\nproduce certain records upon request of a\nregulator or law enforcement agency; and rules\nto promote cooperation among financial\ninstitutions, regulators and law enforcement\nagencies in identifying parties that may be\ninvolved in terrorism, money laundering and\nother crimes.\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (\u201cAML\nAct\u201d), enacted as part of the National Defense\nAuthorization Act, requires the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment to issue National Anti-Money\nLaundering and Countering the Financing of\nTerrorism Priorities, which it did in June\n2021, and to conduct studies and issue\nregulations that may alter some of the due\ndiligence, recordkeeping and reporting\nrequirements that the Bank Secrecy Act and\nPatriot Act impose on banks. The AML Act also\npromotes increased information-sharing and use\nof technology, and increases penalties for\nviolations of the Bank Secrecy Act and\nincludes whistleblower incentives, both of\nwhich could increase the prospect of\nregulatory enforcement.\n                                              \n  Deposit Funding                             \n                                              \nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation Improvement Act of 1991\n(\u201cFDICIA\u201d), only well capitalized and\nadequately capitalized institutions may accept\n\u201cbrokered deposits,\u201d as defined by FDIC\nregulations. Adequately capitalized\ninstitutions, however, must obtain a waiver\nfrom the FDIC before accepting brokered\ndeposits, and such institutions may not pay\nrates that significantly exceed the rates paid\non deposits of similar maturity obtained from\nthe institution\u2019s normal market area or, for\ndeposits obtained from outside the\ninstitution\u2019s normal market area, the national\nrate on deposits of comparable maturity.

Capital\nOne Securities, Inc., KippsDeSanto & Company\nand TripleTree, LLC are registered broker-\ndealers regulated by the SEC and the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). These\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to,\namong other things, net capital rules designed\nto measure the general financial condition and\nliquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these\nrules, broker-dealers are required to maintain\nthe minimum net capital deemed necessary to\nmeet their continuing commitments to customers\nand others, and to keep a substantial portion\nof their assets in relatively liquid form.\nThese rules also limit the ability of a\nbroker-dealer to transfer capital to its\nparent companies and other affiliates. Broker-\ndealers are also subject to regulations\ncovering their business operations, including\nsales and trading practices, public offerings,\npublication of research reports, use and\nsafekeeping of client funds and securities,\ncapital structure, record-keeping and the\nconduct of directors, officers and employees.\n                                              \n  Derivatives Activities                      \n                                              \nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-\nFrank Act\u201d) establishes a regulatory framework\nfor the governance of the over-the-counter\n(\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market, including swaps\nand security-based swaps and the registration\nof certain market participants as a swap\ndealer. CONA provisionally registered with the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d)\nas a swap dealer in 2020. Registration as a\nswap dealer subjects CONA to additional\nregulatory requirements with respect to its\nswaps and other derivatives activities. As a\nresult of CONA\u2019s swap dealer registration, it\nis subject to the rules of the OCC concerning\ncapital and margin requirements for swap\ndealers, including the mandatory exchange of\nvariation margin and initial margin with\ncertain counterparties. Additionally, as a\nprovisionally registered swap dealer, CONA is\nsubject to requirements under the CFTC\u2019s\nregulatory regime, including rules regarding\nbusiness conduct standards, recordkeeping\nobligations, regulatory reporting and\nprocedures relating to swaps trading. CONA\u2019s\nswaps and other derivatives activities do not\nrequire it to register with the SEC as a\nsecurity-based swap dealer.\n                                              \n  Transactions with Affiliates                \n                                              \nThere are various legal restrictions on the\nextent to which we and our non-bank\nsubsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in\ncertain types of transactions with the Bank.\nUnder the Federal Reserve Act and Federal\nReserve regulations, the Bank and its\nsubsidiaries are subject to quantitative and\nqualitative limits on extensions of credit,\npurchases of assets, and certain other\ntransactions involving non-bank affiliates.

The Basel III\nCapital Rules implement certain capital\nrequirements published by the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d),\nalong with certain provisions of the Dodd-\nFrank Act and other capital provisions.\n\nAs a BHC with total consolidated assets of at\nleast $250 billion but less than $700 billion\nand not exceeding any of the applicable risk-\nbased thresholds, the Company is a Category\nIII institution under the Basel III Capital\nRules.\n                                              \n  10    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III\ninstitution, is a Category III bank. Moreover,\nthe Bank, as an insured depository\ninstitution, is subject to prompt corrective\naction (\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations, as further\ndescribed below.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer requirement and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%), as described\nbelow. Our capital and leverage ratios are\ncalculated based on the Basel III standardized\napproach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of\naccumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our regulatory capital as\npermitted for a Category III institution.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe \u201cG-SIB Surcharge.\u201d We are not a G-SIB\nbased on the most recent available data and\nthus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s final rule to implement the\nstress capital buffer requirement, (the\n\u201cStress Capital Buffer Rule\u201d), the Company\u2019s\n\u201cstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer\u201d includes its stress capital buffer\nrequirement (as described below), any G-SIB\nSurcharge (which is not applicable to us) and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%). Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC\nand the FDIC (collectively, \u201cFederal Banking\nAgencies\u201d) set an earlier effective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is recalibrated every year based\non the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults. In particular, the Company\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement equals, subject to\na floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference\nbetween the Company\u2019s starting CET1 capital\nratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital\nratio under the severely adverse scenario of\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test\nplus (ii) the ratio of the Company\u2019s projected\nfour quarters of common stock dividends (for\nthe fourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the Company\u2019s\nprojected CET1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2022 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 is\n3.1%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 7.6%,\n9.1% and 11.1%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2022 through September 30,\n2023.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Bank. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, the Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%\nrespectively.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain\nits capital ratios above the minimum capital\nrequirements plus the applicable capital\nconservation buffer requirements, it will face\nincreasingly strict automatic limitations on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments to certain executive officers.\n\nSee also \u201cDividends, Stock Repurchases and\nTransfers of Funds\u201d below for more information\nabout the stress capital buffer determination\ntimeline and process.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (\u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that provides\nbanking institutions an optional five-year\ntransition period to phase in the impact of\nthe current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nstandard on their regulatory capital (\u201cCECL\nTransition Election\u201d). We adopted the CECL\nstandard (for accounting purposes) as of\nJanuary 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition\nElection (for regulatory capital purposes) in\nthe first quarter of 2020.\n                                              \n  11    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\nand CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule.\nSee \u201c Part II \u4e00 Item 7. MD&A\u4e00 Market Risk\nProfile \u201d for additional information.\n                                              \n  FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action         \n                                              \nFDICIA requires the Federal Banking Agencies\nto take PCA for banks that do not meet minimum\ncapital requirements. FDICIA establishes five\ncapital ratio levels: well capitalized;\nadequately capitalized; undercapitalized;\nsignificantly undercapitalized; and critically\nundercapitalized. The three undercapitalized\ncategories are based upon the amount by which\na bank falls below the ratios applicable to an\nadequately capitalized institution. The\ncapital categories relate to FDICIA\u2019s PCA\nprovisions, and such capital categories may\nnot constitute an accurate representation of\nthe Bank\u2019s overall financial condition or\nprospects.\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules updated the PCA\nframework to reflect new, higher regulatory\ncapital minimums. For an insured depository\ninstitution to be well capitalized, it must\nmaintain a total risk-based capital ratio of\n10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or\nmore; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more;\nand a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An\nadequately capitalized depository institution\nmust maintain a total risk-based capital ratio\nof 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or\nmore; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a\nleverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for\nCategory III and certain other institutions, a\nsupplementary leverage ratio of 3% or more.\nThe PCA provisions also authorize the Federal\nBanking Agencies to reclassify a bank\u2019s\ncapital category or take other action against\nbanks that are determined to be in an unsafe\nor unsound condition or to have engaged in\nunsafe or unsound banking practices.\n\nAs an additional means to identify problems in\nthe financial management of depository\ninstitutions, the Federal Banking Agencies\nestablished certain non-capital safety and\nsoundness standards as required by FDICIA. The\nstandards relate generally to operations and\nmanagement, asset quality, interest rate\nexposure and executive compensation. The\nFederal Banking Agencies are authorized to\ntake action against institutions that fail to\nmeet such standards.\n                                              \n   Basel III and United States Liquidity      \n   Rules                                      \n                                              \nThe Basel Committee has published a liquidity\nframework that includes two standards for\nliquidity risk supervision. One standard, the\nliquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), seeks to\npromote short-term resilience by requiring\norganizations to hold sufficient high-quality\nliquid assets (\u201cHQLAs\u201d) to survive a stress\nscenario lasting for 30 days. The other\nstandard, the net\n                                              \n  12    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nstable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d), seeks to\npromote longer-term resilience by requiring\nsufficient stable funding over a one-year\nperiod based on the liquidity characteristics\nof the organization\u2019s assets and activities.\n\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the\nLCR standard as implemented by the Federal\nReserve and OCC (the \u201cLCR Rule\u201d). The LCR Rule\nrequires each of the Company and the Bank to\nhold an amount of eligible HQLA that equals or\nexceeds 100% of its respective projected\nadjusted net cash outflows over a 30-day\nperiod, each as calculated in accordance with\nthe LCR Rule. The LCR Rule requires each of\nthe Company and the Bank to calculate its\nrespective LCR daily. In addition, the Company\nis required to make quarterly public\ndisclosures of its LCR and certain related\nquantitative liquidity metrics, along with a\nqualitative discussion of its LCR.\n\nAs a Category III institution with less than\n$75 billion in weighted average short-term\nwholesale funding, the Company\u2019s and the\nBank\u2019s total net cash outflows are multiplied\nby an outflow adjustment percentage of 85%.\nAlthough the Bank may hold more HQLA than it\nneeds to meet its LCR requirements, the LCR\nRule restricts the amount of such excess HQLA\nheld at the Bank (referred to as \u201cTrapped\nLiquidity\u201d) that can be included in the\nCompany\u2019s HQLA amount. Because we typically\nmanage the Bank\u2019s LCR to levels well above\n100%, the result is additional Trapped\nLiquidity as the Bank\u2019s net cash outflows are\nreduced by the outflow adjustment percentage\nof 85%.\n\nThe NSFR rule requires the Company and the\nBank to maintain an amount of available stable\nfunding, which is a weighted measure of a\ncompany\u2019s funding sources over a one-year time\nhorizon, calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to equity and liabilities based on\ntheir expected stability, that is no less than\na specified percentage of its required stable\nfunding, which is calculated by applying\nstandardized weightings to assets, derivatives\nexposures and certain other items based on\ntheir liquidity characteristics. As a Category\nIII institution, the Company and the Bank are\neach required to maintain available stable\nfunding in an amount at least equal to 85% of\nits required stable funding. The NSFR rule\nincludes a semi-annual public disclosure\nrequirement, with the first disclosure due 45\ndays after the end of the second quarter of\n2023.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Other\nRelated Requirements\n\nWe are subject to certain enhanced prudential\nstandards under the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended\nby the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and\nConsumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d) and\nimplemented by various regulations issued by\nthe Federal Banking Agencies. The Financial\nStability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) may also\nissue recommendations to the Federal Reserve\nor other primary financial regulatory agencies\nto apply new or enhanced standards to certain\nfinancial activities or practices.\n\nAs part of the enhanced prudential standards,\nthe Company is required to implement\nresolution planning for orderly resolution in\nthe event it faces material financial distress\nor failure. The FDIC issued similar rules\nregarding resolution planning applicable to\nthe Bank. In addition, the OCC has issued\nrules requiring banks with assets of $250\nbillion or more to develop recovery plans\ndetailing the actions they would take to\nremain a going concern when they experience\nconsiderable financial or operational stress,\nbut have not deteriorated to the point that\nresolution is imminent.\n\nThe enhanced prudential standards also include\nsupervisory and company-run stress testing\nrequirements (also known as the \u201cDFAST stress\ntesting requirements\u201d). In particular, the\nFederal Reserve is required to conduct annual\nstress tests on certain covered companies,\nincluding us, to ensure that the covered\ncompanies have sufficient capital to absorb\nlosses and continue operations during adverse\neconomic conditions, as well as to determine\nthe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement as described above. As a Category\nIII institution, we are also required to\nconduct our own stress tests and publish the\nresults of such tests on our website or other\npublic forum. The Company must disclose the\nresults of its company-run stress test on a\nbiennial basis. The OCC has adopted a similar\nstress test rule requiring banks with at least\n$250 billion in assets, including the Bank, to\nconduct their own company-run stress tests.\nUnder that OCC rule, the Bank must also\ndisclose the results of its stress test on a\nbiennial basis.\n\nIn addition, the Company is required to meet\nliquidity risk management standards, conduct\ninternal liquidity stress tests, and maintain\na 30-day buffer of highly liquid assets, in\neach case, consistent with the requirements of\nthe enhanced prudential standards. These\nrequirements are in addition to the LCR and\nNSFR rules, discussed above in \u201cBasel III and\nUnited States Liquidity Rules.\u201d The enhanced\nprudential standards also require that the\nCompany comply with, and hold capital\ncommensurate with, the requirements of, any\nregulations adopted by the Federal Reserve\nrelating to capital planning and stress tests.\nStress testing and capital planning\nregulations are discussed further below under\n\u201cDividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of\nFunds.\u201d Finally, the Company is also required\nto establish and maintain an enterprise-wide\nRisk Management Framework (\u201cFramework\u201d) that\nincludes a risk committee and a chief risk\nofficer.\n                                              \n  13    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAlthough not a requirement of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, the OCC established regulatory guidelines\n(\u201cHeightened Standards Guidelines\u201d) that apply\nheightened standards to the governance and\nrisk management practices of large\ninstitutions subject to its supervision,\nincluding the Bank. The Heightened Standards\nGuidelines establish standards for the\ndevelopment and implementation by the Bank of\na risk governance framework.\n\nDividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of\nFunds\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital planning\nrules and related supervisory process\n(commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review or \u201cCCAR\u201d requirements), a\n\u201ccovered BHC,\u201d such as the Company, must\nsubmit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve\non an annual basis that contains a description\nof all planned capital actions, including\ndividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-\nquarter planning horizon beginning with the\nfirst quarter of the calendar year the capital\nplan is submitted (\u201cCCAR cycle\u201d).\n\nThe DFAST stress testing requirements,\ndescribed above in \u201cEnhanced Prudential\nStandards and Other Related Requirements,\u201d is\na complementary exercise to CCAR. It is a\nforward-looking exercise conducted by the\nFederal Reserve and each covered company to\nhelp assess whether a company has sufficient\ncapital to absorb losses and continue\noperations during adverse economic conditions.\n\nPursuant to the capital planning rules, the\nCompany must file its capital plan with the\nFederal Reserve by April 5 of each year\n(unless the Federal Reserve designates a later\ndate), using data as of the end of the prior\ncalendar year. The Federal Reserve will\nrelease the results of the supervisory stress\ntest and notify the Company of its stress\ncapital buffer requirement by June 30 of that\nyear. The Company will have two business days\nfrom receipt of its stress capital buffer\nrequirement to make any necessary adjustments\nto its planned capital distributions. The\nFederal Reserve will then finalize the stress\ncapital buffer requirement for the Company and\nconfirm the Company\u2019s planned capital\ndistributions by August 31 of that year. The\nCompany\u2019s final stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be effective from the fourth\nquarter of the year the capital plan is\nsubmitted through the third quarter of the\nfollowing year. The Company may make the\nplanned capital distributions confirmed by the\nFederal Reserve. In addition, under the Stress\nCapital Buffer Rule, the Company is no longer\nrequired to seek prior approval of the Federal\nReserve to make capital distributions in\nexcess of those included in its capital plan\nso long as the Company is otherwise in\ncompliance with the capital rule\u2019s automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has announced that it\nwould maintain its pre-CECL framework for\ncalculating allowances on loans in the\nsupervisory stress test through the 2023 cycle\nuntil the impact of CECL is better known and\nunderstood.\n\nDividends from the Company\u2019s direct and\nindirect subsidiaries represent a major source\nof the funds we use to pay dividends on our\ncapital stock, make payments on our corporate\ndebt securities and meet our other\nobligations. There are various federal law\nlimitations on the extent to which the Bank\ncan finance or otherwise supply funds to the\nCompany through dividends and loans. These\nlimitations include minimum regulatory capital\nrequirements, federal banking law requirements\nconcerning the payment of dividends out of net\nprofits or surplus, provisions of Sections 23A\nand 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and\nRegulation W governing transactions between an\ninsured depository institution and its\naffiliates, as well as general federal\nregulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or\nunsound practices. In general, federal and\napplicable state banking laws prohibit insured\ndepository institutions, such as the Bank,\nfrom making dividend distributions without\nfirst obtaining regulatory approval if such\ndistributions are not paid out of available\nearnings or would cause the institution to\nfail to meet applicable capital adequacy\nstandards.\n                                              \n  Investment in the Company and the Bank      \n                                              \nCertain acquisitions of our capital stock may\nbe subject to regulatory approval or notice\nunder federal or state law. Investors are\nresponsible for ensuring that they do not,\ndirectly or indirectly, acquire shares of our\ncapital stock in excess of the amount that can\nbe acquired without regulatory approval,\nincluding under the BHC Act and the Change in\nBank Control Act (\u201cCIBC Act\u201d).\n\nFederal law and regulations prohibit any\nperson or company from acquiring control of\nthe Company or the Bank without, in most\ncases, prior written approval of the Federal\nReserve or the OCC, as applicable. Control\nunder the BHC Act exists if, among other\nthings, a person or company acquires more than\n25% of any class of our voting stock or\notherwise has a controlling influence over us.\nA rebuttable presumption of control arises\nunder the CIBC Act for a publicly traded BHC\nsuch as ourselves if a person or company\nacquires more than 10% of any class of our\nvoting stock.\n\nAdditionally, the Bank is a \u201cbank\u201d within the\nmeaning of Chapter 7 of Title 6.2 of the Code\nof Virginia governing the acquisition of\ninterests in Virginia financial institutions\n(\u201cVirginia Financial Institution Holding\nCompany Act\u201d).

The FDIC\nsets a Designated Reserve Ratio (\u201cDRR\u201d) for\nthe DIF. To maintain the DIF, member\ninstitutions may be assessed an insurance\npremium, and the FDIC may take action to\nincrease insurance premiums if the DRR falls\nbelow its required level.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio\nfell to 1.30 percent. The FDIC, as required\nunder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\nestablished a plan in September 2020, to\nrestore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or\nexceed 1.35 percent within eight years. On\nOctober 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule\nthat increases the initial base deposit\ninsurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis\npoints for all insured depository institutions\nto improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve\nratio reaches 1.35 percent by the statutory\ndeadline of September 30, 2028. The rule took\neffect on January 1, 2023 and this increase\nwill be reflected in the Bank\u2019s first\nquarterly assessment in 2023.\n                                              \n  Source of Strength                          \n                                              \nFederal Reserve rules require a BHC to serve\nas a source of financial and managerial\nstrength to its subsidiary banks (the so-\ncalled \u201csource of strength doctrine\u201d). In\naddition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires a BHC to\nserve as a source of financial strength to its\nsubsidiary banks and requires the Federal\nBanking Agencies to jointly adopt new rules\nimplementing this requirement. Such rules have\nnot yet been proposed.\n                                              \n  FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority          \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with\nliquidation authority that may be used to\nliquidate non-bank financial companies and\nBHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in\nconsultation with the President and based on\nthe recommendation of the Federal Reserve and\nother appropriate Federal Banking Agencies,\ndetermines that doing so is necessary, among\nother criteria, to mitigate serious adverse\neffects on U.S. financial stability. Upon such\na determination, the FDIC would be appointed\nreceiver and must liquidate the company in a\nway that mitigates significant risks to\nfinancial stability and minimizes moral\nhazard. The costs of a liquidation of the\ncompany would be borne by shareholders and\nunsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by\nrisk-based assessments on large financial\ncompanies. The FDIC has issued rules\nimplementing certain provisions of its\nliquidation authority and may issue additional\nrules in the future.\n                                              \n  Climate-related Developments                \n                                              \nClimate change and the risks it may pose to\nfinancial institutions is an area of increased\nfocus by the Federal Banking Agencies as well\nas federal and state legislative bodies. In\nthe future, new regulations or guidance may be\nissued, or other regulatory or supervisory\nactions may be taken, in this area by the\nFederal Banking Agencies or other regulatory\nagencies, or new statutory requirements may be\nadopted. For example, each of the Federal\nBanking Agencies has requested feedback on its\nrespective draft principles designed to\nsupport the identification and management of\nclimate-related financial risks at regulated\ninstitutions with more than $100 billion in\ntotal consolidated assets. The Federal Banking\nAgencies plan to use this feedback to inform\nfuture guidance with respect to climate-\nrelated financial risk.\n\nRegulation of Businesses by Authorities\nOutside the United States\n\nThe Bank is subject to laws and regulations in\nforeign jurisdictions where it operates,\ncurrently in the U.K. and Canada. In the U.K.,\nthe Bank operates through COEP, which was\nestablished in 1999 and is an authorized\npayment institution regulated by the Financial\nConduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d). COEP\u2019s parent,\nCapital One Global Corporation, is wholly\nowned by the Bank and is subject to regulation\nby the Federal Reserve as an \u201cagreement\ncorporation\u201d under the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nRegulation K. COEP does not take deposits. In\nCanada, the Bank operates as an authorized\nforeign bank and is permitted to conduct its\ncredit card business in Canada through its\nCanadian branch, Capital One Bank (Canada\nBranch) (\u201cCapital One Canada\u201d). Capital One\nCanada does not take deposits. The primary\nregulator of Capital One Canada is the Office\nof the Superintendent of Financial\nInstitutions.\n                                              \n  15    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe foreign legal and regulatory requirements\nto which the Company\u2019s non-U.S. operation are\nsubject include, among others, those related\nto consumer protection, business practices,\nand data security and limits on interchange\nfees.

and customer\nbehavior may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe offer a broad array of financial products\nand services to consumers, small businesses\nand commercial clients. A prolonged period of\neconomic volatility, slow growth, or a\nsignificant deterioration in economic\nconditions, in the U.S., Canada or the U.K.,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations\nas customers default on their loans, maintain\nlower deposit levels or, in the case of credit\ncard accounts, carry lower balances and reduce\ncredit card purchase activity.\n\nSome of the risks we face in connection with\nadverse changes and instability in the\nmacroeconomic environment and changes in\nconsumer confidence levels and behavior,\ninclude the following:\n\n\u2022 Monetary policies and actions taken by the\nFederal Reserve and other central banks or\ngovernmental authorities;\n\n\u2022 Economic deterioration due to escalation of\nmilitary hostilities or other geopolitical\ninstabilities;\n\n\u2022 Changes in payment patterns, increases or\nfluctuations in delinquencies and default\nrates, decreased consumer spending, inflation,\nfluctuation in interest rates, lower demand\nfor credit and shifts in consumer behavior,\nincluding deposits and payments;\n\n\u2022 Increases in our charge-off rate caused by\nbankruptcies and reduced ability to recover\ndebt that we have previously charged-off;\n\n\u2022 Recent changes in usage of commercial real\nestate, which may have a sustained negative\nimpact on utilization rates and values;\n\n\u2022 Decreased reliability of the process and\nmodels, including those we use to estimate our\nallowance for credit losses, particularly if\nunexpected variations in key inputs and\nassumptions cause actual losses to diverge\nfrom the projections of our models and our\nestimates become increasingly subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. See \u201c We face risks\nresulting from the extensive use of models and\ndata. \u201d\n\nThe U.K. and the EU agreed to a free trade\ndeal at the end of 2020 relating to the U.K.\u2019s\nexit from the EU. Although this deal has\nprovided greater near-term stability, there is\nstill some degree of uncertainty as to the\nrelationship between the U.K and the EU, which\nmay increase volatility in the regional and\nglobal financial markets. In addition, the\nglobal economy, including economic conditions\nin the U.K., has been negatively impacted by\nthe war between Russia and Ukraine. Continued\nescalation of geopolitical tensions related to\nthe war, including increased trade barriers or\nrestrictions on global trade, could further\ndeteriorate international economic conditions.\nWe continue to consider and monitor the\npotential impacts of the relationship between\nthe U.K. and EU, as well as the war between\nRussia and Ukraine.\n\nFluctuations in market interest rates or\nvolatility in the capital markets could\nadversely affect our business.\n\nLike other financial institutions, our\nbusiness is sensitive to interest rate\nmovements and the performance of the capital\nmarkets.\n\nWe rely on access to the capital markets to\nfund our operations and to grow our business.\nOur ability to borrow from other financial\ninstitutions or to engage in funding\ntransactions on favorable terms or at all\ncould be adversely affected by disruptions,\nuncertainty or volatility in the capital\nmarkets or other events, including changing\ncredit rating agency requirements. For\nexample, a credit rating downgrade could\naffect our ability to access the capital\nmarkets, increase our funding costs and have a\nnegative impact on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, increased charge-offs, rising\ninterest rates and other events may cause our\nsecuritization transactions to amortize\nearlier than scheduled or reduce the value of\nthe securities that we hold for liquidity\npurposes, which could accelerate our need for\nadditional funding from other sources.\n\nAdditionally, changes in interest rates could\nadversely affect the results of our operations\nand financial condition. For example, we\nborrow money from other institutions and\ndepositors, which we use to make loans to\ncustomers and invest in debt securities and\nother interest-earning assets. We earn\ninterest on these loans and assets and pay\ninterest on the money we borrow from\ninstitutions and depositors. In response to\ninflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve\nhas reversed its policy of maintaining the low\nbenchmark federal funds interest rate over the\nlast several years. In March 2022, the Federal\nReserve began increasing the benchmark federal\nfunds interest rate and has signaled its\nintention to continue to raise interest rates\nin an effort to tame\n                                              \n  23    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ninflation. Thus, the amount of interest that\nwe pay on certain borrowings has increased and\ncould increase further. Additionally, a\nshrinking yield premium between short-term and\nlong-term market interest rates and in the\nrelationship between our funding basis rate\nand our lending basis rate and inflation could\naffect our profitability.\n\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating\nthe effect on our earnings, economic value and\ncapital under various scenarios that differ\nbased on assumptions about the direction and\nthe magnitude of interest rate changes. We\ntake risk mitigation actions based on those\nassessments. We face the risk that changes in\ninterest rates could materially reduce our net\ninterest income and our earnings, especially\nif actual conditions turn out to be materially\ndifferent than those we assumed. See \u201cPart\nII\u2014Item 7. MD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d for\nadditional information.\n\nFurthermore, interest rate fluctuations and\ncompetitor responses to those changes may\naffect the rate of customer prepayments for\nauto and other term loans and may affect the\nbalances customers carry on their credit cards\nand their balances in the deposits accounts\nthey have with us. For example, increases in\ninterest rates increase debt service\nrequirements for some of our borrowers, which\nmay adversely affect those borrowers\u2019 ability\nto pay as contractually obligated. This could\nresult in additional or fluctuating\ndelinquencies or charge-offs and negatively\nimpact our results of operations. These\nchanges can reduce the overall yield on our\ninterest-earning asset portfolio. An inability\nto attract or maintain deposits could\nmaterially affect our ability to fund our\nbusiness and our liquidity position. Many\nother financial institutions have increased\ntheir reliance on deposit funding and, as\nsuch, we expect continued competition in the\ndeposit markets. We cannot predict how this\ncompetition will affect our costs. If we are\nrequired to offer higher interest rates to\nattract or maintain deposits, our funding\ncosts will be adversely impacted. Changes in\nvaluations in the debt and equity markets\ncould have a negative impact on the assets we\nhold in our investment portfolio. Such market\nchanges could also have a negative impact on\nthe valuation of assets for which we provide\nservicing.\n\nOur results of operations may be adversely\naffected by the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\nAlthough the global economy has begun to\nrecover from the COVID-19 pandemic, certain\nadverse consequences of the pandemic,\nincluding labor shortages, disruptions of\nglobal supply chains and inflationary\npressures, continue to impact the\nmacroeconomic environment and could adversely\naffect our business. Should these ongoing\neffects of the pandemic continue for an\nextended period or worsen, our purchase\nvolume, loan balances and the overall demand\nfor our products and services may be\nsignificantly impacted, which could adversely\naffect our financial condition and other\nresults of operations. In addition, we could\nexperience higher credit losses in our loan\nportfolios and increases in our allowance for\ncredit losses beyond current levels. We could\nalso experience impairments of other financial\nassets and other negative impacts on our\nfinancial position, including possible\nconstraints on liquidity and capital, as well\nas higher costs of capital. Long-term\nconsequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial\ncondition, as well as our capital and\nliquidity ratios and our ability to take\ncapital actions, will depend on future\ndevelopments that remain uncertain, including,\nfor example, future actions taken by\ngovernmental authorities, central banks and\nother third parties in response to the\npandemic and the effects on our customers,\ncounterparties, associates and third-party\nservice providers.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, we moved our\nassociates to a hybrid work model. As a result\nwe may experience increased costs and/or\ndisruption as we experiment with hybrid work\nmodels, in addition to potential effects on\nour ability to operate effectively and\nmaintain our corporate culture. We will\ncontinue to monitor local conditions to ensure\nthe safety of our associates and customers\nwhile providing critical banking services. We\nmay take further actions as required by\ngovernment authorities or that we otherwise\ndetermine are in the best interests of our\ncustomers, associates and business partners.\nThese measures could impair our ability to\nperform critical functions and may adversely\nimpact our results of operations.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nWe may experience increases or fluctuations in\ndelinquencies and credit losses, inaccurate\nestimates and inadequate reserves.\n\nLike other lenders, we face the risk that our\ncustomers will not repay their loans. A\ncustomer\u2019s ability and willingness to repay us\ncan be adversely affected by decreases in the\nincome of the borrower or increases in their\npayment obligations to other lenders, whether\nas a result of higher debt levels or rising\ninterest rates, by rising levels of inflation,\nor by restricted availability of credit\ngenerally. We may fail to quickly identify and\nreduce our exposure to customers that are\nlikely to default on their payment\nobligations, whether by closing credit lines\nor restricting authorizations. Our ability to\nmanage credit risk also is affected by legal\nor regulatory changes (such as restrictions on\ncollections, bankruptcy laws, minimum payment\nregulations and\n                                              \n  24    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nre-age guidance), competitors\u2019 actions and\nconsumer behavior, and depends on the\neffectiveness of our collections staff,\ntechniques and models.\n\nRising losses or leading indicators of rising\nlosses (such as higher delinquencies, charge-\noffs, higher rates of nonperforming loans,\nhigher bankruptcy rates, lower collateral\nvalues, elevated unemployment rates or\nchanging market terms) may require us to\nincrease our allowance for credit losses,\nwhich would decrease our profitability if we\nare unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to\ncompensate for higher losses. In particular,\nwe face the following risks in this area:\n\n\u2022 Missed Payments: Our customers may miss\npayments. Loan charge-offs (including from\nbankruptcies) are generally preceded by missed\npayments or other indications of worsening\nfinancial condition for our customers.\nHistorically, customers are more likely to\nmiss payments during an economic downturn,\nrecession, periods of high unemployment, or\nprolonged periods of slow economic growth. In\naddition, we face the risk that consumer and\ncommercial customer behavior may change (for\nexample, an increase in the unwillingness or\ninability of customers to repay debt, which\nmay be heightened by increasing interest rates\nor levels of consumer debt), causing a long-\nterm rise or fluctuations in delinquencies and\ncharge-offs.\n\n\u2022 Incorrect Estimates of Expected Losses: The\ncredit quality of our portfolio can have a\nsignificant impact on our earnings. We allow\nfor and reserve against credit risks based on\nour assessment of expected credit losses in\nour loan portfolios. This process, which is\ncritical to our financial condition and\nresults of operations, requires complex\njudgments, including forecasts of economic\nconditions. We may underestimate our expected\nlosses and fail to hold an allowance for\ncredit losses sufficient to account for these\nlosses. Incorrect assumptions could lead to\nmaterial underestimations of expected credit\nlosses and an inadequate allowance for credit\nlosses. See \u201c We face risks resulting from the\nextensive use of models and data. \u201d\n\n\u2022 Inaccurate Underwriting: Our ability to\naccurately assess the creditworthiness of our\ncustomers may diminish, which could result in\nan increase in our credit losses and a\ndeterioration of our returns. See \u201c Our risk\nmanagement strategies may not be fully\neffective in mitigating our risk exposures in\nall market environments or against all types\nof risk .\u201d\n\n\u2022 Business Mix: We engage in a diverse mix of\nbusinesses with a broad range of potential\ncredit exposure. Because we originate a\nrelatively greater proportion of consumer\nloans in our loan portfolio compared to other\nlarge bank peers and originate both prime and\nsubprime credit card accounts and auto loans,\nwe may experience higher delinquencies and a\ngreater number of accounts charging off, as\nwell as greater fluctuations in those metrics,\ncompared to other large bank peers, which\ncould result in increased credit losses,\noperating costs and regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, a change in this business mix\nover time to include proportionally more\nconsumer loans or subprime credit card\naccounts or auto loans could adversely affect\nthe credit quality of our portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Increasing Charge-off Recognition/Allowance\nfor Credit Losses: We account for the\nallowance for credit losses according to\naccounting and regulatory guidelines and\nrules, including Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) standards and the\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination\nCouncil (\u201cFFIEC\u201d) Account Management Guidance.\nWe measure our allowance for credit losses\nunder the CECL standard, which is based on\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of expected\nlifetime credit losses. The impact of\nmeasuring our allowance for credit losses on\nour results will depend on the characteristics\nof our financial instruments, economic\nconditions, and our economic and loss\nforecasts. The application of the CECL\nstandard may require us to increase reserves\nfaster and to a higher level in an economic\ndownturn, resulting in greater adverse impact\nto our results and our capital ratios than we\nwould have experienced in similar\ncircumstances prior to the adoption of CECL.\nIn addition, because credit cards represent a\nsignificant portion of our product mix, we\ncould be disproportionately affected by use of\nthe CECL standard, as compared to our large\nbank peers with a different product mix.\n                                              \n  25    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Asset Values: The collateral we\nhave on secured loans could be insufficient to\ncompensate us for credit losses. When\ncustomers default on their secured loans, we\nattempt to recover collateral where\npermissible and appropriate. However, the\nvalue of the collateral may not be sufficient\nto compensate us for the amount of the unpaid\nloan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering\nthe remaining balance from our customers.\nDecreases in real estate and other asset\nvalues adversely affect the collateral value\nfor our commercial lending activities, while\nthe auto business is similarly exposed to\ncollateral risks arising from the auction\nmarkets that determine used car prices.\nBorrowers may be less likely to continue\nmaking payments on loans if the value of the\nproperty used as collateral for the loan is\nless than what the borrower owes, even if the\nborrower is still financially able to make the\npayments. In that circumstance, the recovery\nof such property could be insufficient to\ncompensate us for the value of these loans\nupon a default. In our auto business, business\nand economic conditions that negatively affect\nhousehold incomes, housing prices and consumer\nbehavior, as well as technological advances\nthat make older cars obsolete faster, could\ndecrease (i) the demand for new and used\nvehicles and (ii) the value of the collateral\nunderlying our portfolio of auto loans, which\ncould cause the number of consumers who become\ndelinquent or default on their loans to\nincrease.\n\n\u2022 Geographic and Industry Concentration:\nAlthough our consumer lending is\ngeographically diversified, approximately 40%\nof our commercial real estate loan portfolio\nis concentrated in the Northeast region. The\nregional economic conditions in the Northeast\naffect the demand for our commercial products\nand services as well as the ability of our\ncustomers to repay their commercial real\nestate loans and the value of the collateral\nsecuring these loans. An economic downturn or\nprolonged period of slow economic growth in,\nor a catastrophic event or natural disaster\nthat disproportionately affects the Northeast\nregion could have a material adverse effect on\nthe performance of our commercial real estate\nloan portfolio and our results of operations.\nIn addition, our Commercial Banking strategy\nincludes an industry-specific focus. If any of\nthe industries that we focus on experience\nchanges, we may experience increased credit\nlosses and our results of operations could be\nadversely impacted.\n                                              \n   Capital and Liquidity Risk                 \n                                              \nWe may not be able to maintain adequate\ncapital or liquidity levels or may become\nsubject to revised capital or liquidity\nrequirements, which could have a negative\nimpact on our financial results and our\nability to return capital to our stockholders.\n\nFinancial institutions are subject to\nextensive and complex capital and liquidity\nrequirements, which are subject to change.\nThese requirements affect our ability to lend,\ngrow deposit balances, make acquisitions and\ndistribute capital. Failure to maintain\nadequate capital or liquidity levels, whether\ndue to adverse developments in our business or\nthe economy or to changes in the applicable\nrequirements, could subject us to a variety of\nrestrictions and/or remedial actions imposed\nby our regulators. These include limitations\non the ability to pay dividends and/or\nrepurchase shares and the issuance of a\ncapital directive to increase capital. Such\nlimitations or capital directive could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations.\n\nWe consider various factors in the management\nof capital, including the impact of both\ninternal and supervisory stress scenarios on\nour capital levels as determined by our\ninternal modeling and the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nestimation of losses in supervisory stress\nscenarios that are used to annually set our\nstress capital buffer requirement. There can\nbe significant differences between our\nmodeling and the Federal Reserve\u2019s projections\nfor a given supervisory stress scenario and\nbetween the capital needs suggested by our\ninternal stress scenarios and the supervisory\nscenarios. Therefore, although our estimated\ncapital levels under stress disclosed as part\nof the stress testing processes may suggest\nthat we have a particular capacity to return\ncapital to stockholders and remain well\ncapitalized under stress, the Federal\nReserve\u2019s modeling, our internal modeling of\nanother scenario and/or other factors related\nto our capital management process may reflect\na lower capacity to return capital to\nstockholders than that indicated by the\nprojections released in the stress testing\nprocesses. This in turn, could lead to\nrestrictions on our ability to pay dividends\nand engage in share repurchases. See \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d\nfor additional information.\n\nWe also consider various factors in the\nmanagement of liquidity, including maintaining\nsufficient liquid assets to meet the\nrequirements of several internal and\nregulatory stress tests. There can be\nsignificant differences in estimated liquidity\nneeds between internal and regulatory stress\ntesting, and liquidity resources required to\nmeet regulatory requirements, such as\napplicable LCR and NSFR requirements, may\nexceed what would otherwise be required to\nsatisfy internal liquidity metrics and stress\ntesting. Regulatory liquidity stress testing\nand regulatory liquidity requirements may,\ntherefore, require us to take actions to\nincrease our liquid assets or alter our\nactivities or funding sources, which could\nnegatively affect our financial results or our\n                                              \n  26    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nability to return capital to our stockholders.\nSee \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u201d for additional information.\n\nIn addition, changes to applicable capital and\nliquidity requirements could result in\nincreased expenses or unexpected or new\nlimitations on our ability to pay dividends\nand engage in share repurchases.\n\nLimitations on our ability to receive\ndividends from our subsidiaries could affect\nour liquidity and ability to pay dividends and\nrepurchase common stock.\n\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity\nfrom our subsidiaries, including the Bank and\nour broker-dealer subsidiaries. Dividends to\nus from these direct and indirect subsidiaries\nhave represented a major source of funds for\nus to pay dividends on our common and\npreferred stock, repurchase common stock, make\npayments on corporate debt securities and meet\nother obligations. These capital distributions\nmay be limited by law, regulation or\nsupervisory policy. There are various federal\nlaw limitations on the extent to which the\nBank can finance or otherwise supply funds to\nus through dividends and loans. These\nlimitations include minimum regulatory capital\nrequirements, federal banking law requirements\nconcerning the payment of dividends out of net\nprofits or surplus, and Sections 23A and 23B\nof the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W\ngoverning transactions between an insured\ndepository institution and its affiliates, as\nwell as general federal regulatory oversight\nto prevent unsafe or unsound practices. Our\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are also subject to\nlaws and regulations, including net capital\nrequirements, that may limit their ability to\npay dividends or make other distributions to\nus. If our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not\nsufficient to make dividend payments to us\nwhile maintaining adequate capital levels, our\nliquidity may be affected and we may not be\nable to make dividend payments to our common\nor preferred stockholders, repurchase our\ncommon stock, make payments on outstanding\ncorporate debt securities or meet other\nobligations, each and any of which could have\na material adverse impact on our results of\noperations, our financial position or the\nperception of our financial health. The\nfrequency and size of any future dividends to\nour stockholders and stock repurchases will\ndepend upon regulatory limitations imposed by\nthe Federal Banking Agencies and the SEC and\nour results of operations, financial\ncondition, capital levels, cash requirements,\nfuture prospects, regulatory review and other\nfactors as further described in \u201cPart I\u2014Item\n1. Business\u2014Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nWe face risks related to our operational,\ntechnological and organizational\ninfrastructure.\n\nOur ability to retain and attract customers\ndepends on our ability to develop, operate,\nand adapt our technology and organizational\ninfrastructure in a rapidly changing\nenvironment. In addition, we must accurately\nprocess, record and monitor an increasingly\nlarge number of complex transactions. Digital\ntechnology, cloud-based services, data and\nsoftware development are deeply embedded into\nour business model and how we work.\n\nSimilar to other large corporations in our\nindustry, we are exposed to operational risk\nthat can manifest itself in many ways, such as\nerrors in execution, inadequate processes,\ninaccurate models, faulty or disabled\ntechnological infrastructure, malicious\ndisruption and fraud by employees or persons\noutside of our company, whether through\nattacks on Capital One directly or on our\ncustomers. In addition, the increasing use of\nnear real-time money movement solutions, among\nother risks, increases the complexity of\npreventing, detecting and recovering\nfraudulent transactions. In addition, we are\nheavily dependent on the security, capability,\nintegrity and continuous availability of the\ntechnology systems that we use to manage our\ninternal financial and other systems, monitor\nrisk and compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, provide services to our\ncustomers, develop and offer new products and\ncommunicate with stakeholders. We also face\nrisk of adverse customer impacts and business\ndisruption arising from the execution of\nstrategic initiatives and operational plans we\nmay pursue across our operations.\n\nIf we do not maintain the necessary\noperational, technological and organizational\ninfrastructure to operate our business,\nincluding to maintain the resiliency and\nsecurity of that infrastructure, our business\nand reputation could be materially adversely\naffected. We also are subject to disruptions\nto our systems arising from events that are\nwholly or partially beyond our control, which\nmay include computer viruses, electrical or\ntelecommunications outages, bugs, design flaws\nin foundational components or platforms,\navailability and quality of vulnerability\npatches from key vendors, cyber-attacks and\nother security incidents, natural disasters,\nother damage to property or physical assets,\nor events arising from local or larger scale\npolitics, including terrorist acts. Any\nfailure to maintain our infrastructure or\nprevent disruption of our systems and\napplications could diminish our ability to\noperate our businesses, service customer\naccounts and protect customers\u2019 information,\nor result in potential liability to customers,\nreputational damage, regulatory intervention\nand customers\u2019 loss of confidence in our\nbusinesses, any of which could result in a\nmaterial adverse effect.\n                                              \n  27    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe also rely on the business infrastructure\nand systems of third parties with which we do\nbusiness and to whom we outsource the\noperation, maintenance and development of our\ninformation technology and communications\nsystems. We have substantially migrated all\naspects of our core information technology\nsystems and customer-facing applications to\nthird-party cloud infrastructure platforms,\nprincipally AWS. If we fail to architect,\nadminister or oversee these environments in a\nwell-managed, secure and effective manner, or\nif such platforms become unavailable, are\ndisrupted, fail to scale, do not operate as\ndesigned, or do not meet their service level\nagreements for any reason, we may experience\nunplanned service disruption or unforeseen\ncosts which could result in material harm to\nour business and operations. We must\nsuccessfully develop and maintain information,\nfinancial reporting, disclosure, privacy, data\nprotection, data security and other controls\nadapted to our reliance on outside platforms\nand providers. In addition, AWS, or other\nservice providers could experience system or\ntelecommunication breakdowns or failures,\noutages, degradation in service, downtime,\nfailure to scale, software bugs, cyber-attacks\nand other security incidents, adverse changes\nto financial condition, bankruptcy, or other\nadverse conditions, (including conditions\nwhich interfere with our access to and use of\nAWS), which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and reputation. Thus,\nthe substantial amount of our infrastructure\nthat we outsource to AWS or to other third\nparties may increase our risk exposure.\n\nAny disruptions, failures or inaccuracies of\nour operational processes, technology systems\nand models, including those associated with\nimprovements or modifications to such\ntechnology systems and models, could cause us\nto be unable to market and manage our products\nand services, manage our risk, meet our\nregulatory obligations or report our financial\nresults in a timely and accurate manner, all\nof which could have a negative impact on our\nresults of operations. In addition, our\nongoing investments in infrastructure, which\nare necessary to maintain a competitive\nbusiness, integrate acquisitions and establish\nscalable operations, may increase our\nexpenses. As our business develops, changes or\nexpands, additional expenses can arise as a\nresult of a reevaluation of business\nstrategies, management of outsourced services,\nasset purchases or other acquisitions,\nstructural reorganization, compliance with new\nlaws or regulations, the integration of newly\nacquired businesses, or the prevention or\noccurrence of cyber-attacks and other security\nincidents. If we are unable to successfully\nmanage our expenses, our financial results\nwill be negatively affected. Changes to our\nbusiness, including those resulting from our\nstrategic objectives, also requires robust\ngovernance to ensure that our objectives are\nexecuted as intended without adversely\nimpacting our customers, associates,\noperations or financial performance.\nIneffective change management oversight and\ngovernance over the execution of our strategic\nobjectives could expose us to operational,\nstrategic and reputational risk and could\nnegatively impact customers or our financial\nperformance.\n\nA cyber-attack or other security incident,\nincluding one that results in the theft, loss,\nmanipulation or misuse of information\n(including personal information), or the\ndisabling of systems and access to information\ncritical to business operations, may result in\nincreased costs, reductions in revenue,\nreputational damage, legal exposure and\nbusiness disruptions.\n\nOur ability to provide our products and\nservices, many of which are internet-based,\nand communicate with our customers, depends\nupon the management and safeguarding of\ninformation systems and infrastructure,\nnetworks, software, data, technology,\nmethodologies and business secrets, including\nthose of our service providers. Our products\nand services involve the collection,\nauthentication, management, usage, storage,\ntransmission and eventual destruction of\nsensitive and confidential information,\nincluding personal information, regarding our\ncustomers and their accounts, our employees,\nour partners and other third parties with\nwhich we do business. We also have\narrangements in place with third parties\nthrough which we share and receive information\nabout their customers who are or may become\nour customers. The financial services\nindustry, including Capital One, is\nparticularly at risk because of the use of and\nreliance on digital banking products and other\ndigital services, including mobile banking\nproducts, such as mobile payments, and other\ninternet- and cloud-based products and\napplications, and the development of\nadditional remote connectivity solutions,\nwhich increase cybersecurity risks and\nexposure. Consumer acceptance and use of such\ndigital banking products and services has\nsubstantially increased since the onset of the\nCOVID pandemic.\n\nTechnologies, systems, networks, and other\ndevices of Capital One, as well as those of\nour employees, service providers, partners and\nother third parties with whom we interact,\nhave been and may continue to be the subject\nof cyber-attacks and other security incidents,\nincluding computer viruses, hacking, malware,\nransomware, supply chain attacks,\nvulnerabilities, credential stuffing, or\nphishing or other forms of social engineering.\nSuch cyber-attacks and other security\nincidents are designed to lead to various\nharmful outcomes, such as unauthorized\ntransactions in Capital One accounts,\nunauthorized or unintended access to or\nrelease, gathering, monitoring, disclosure,\nloss, destruction, corruption, disablement,\nencryption, misuse, modification or other\nprocessing of confidential or sensitive\ninformation (including personal information),\nintellectual property, software, methodologies\nor business secrets, disruption, sabotage or\ndegradation of service, systems or networks,\nor other damage. These threats may derive\nfrom, among other things, error, fraud or\nmalice on the part of our employees, insiders,\nor third parties or may result from accidental\ntechnological failure or design flaws. Any of\nthese parties may also attempt to fraudulently\ninduce\n                                              \n  28    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nemployees, service providers, customers,\npartners or other third-party users of our\nsystems or networks to disclose confidential\nor sensitive information (including personal\ninformation) in order to gain access to our\nsystems, networks or data or that of our\ncustomers, partners, or third parties with\nwhom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or\notherwise improper payment. For instance, any\nparty that obtains our confidential or\nsensitive information (including personal\ninformation) through a cyber-attack or other\nsecurity incident may use this information for\nransom, to be paid by us or a third party, as\npart of a fraudulent activity that is part of\na broader criminal activity, or for other\nillicit purposes.\n\nFor example, on July 29, 2019, we announced\nthat on March 22 and 23, 2019 an outside\nindividual gained unauthorized access to our\nsystems (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d). This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers. While the Cybersecurity\nIncident has been remediated, it has resulted\nin fines, litigation, settlements, government\ninvestigations and other regulatory\nenforcement inquiries, as well as consent\norders with the Federal Reserve and the OCC.\nOn August 31, 2022, the OCC terminated its\nconsent order. Cyber and information security\nrisks for large financial institutions like us\ncontinue to increase due to the proliferation\nof new technologies, the industry-wide shift\nto reliance upon the internet to conduct\nfinancial transactions, and the increased\nsophistication and activities of malicious\nactors, organized crime, perpetrators of\nfraud, hackers, terrorists, activists,\nextremist parties, formal and informal\ninstrumentalities of foreign governments,\nstate-sponsored actors and other external\nparties. In addition, our customers access our\nproducts and services using personal devices\nthat are necessarily external to our security\ncontrol systems. There has also been a\nsignificant proliferation of consumer\ninformation available on the internet\nresulting from breaches of third-party\nentities, including personal information, log-\nin credentials and authentication data. While\nwe were not directly involved in these third-\nparty breach events, the stolen information\ncan create a threat for our customers if their\nCapital One log-in credentials are the same as\nor similar to the credentials that have been\ncompromised on other internet sites. This\nthreat could include the risk of unauthorized\naccount access, data loss and fraud. The use\nof artificial intelligence, \u201cbots\u201d or other\nautomation software can increase the velocity\nand efficacy of these types of attacks. As our\nemployees are currently operating under our\nhybrid work model, our remote interaction with\nservice providers, partners and other third\nparties on systems, networks and environments\nover which we have less control increases our\ncybersecurity risk exposure. We will likely\nface an increasing number of attempted cyber-\nattacks as we expand our mobile and other\ninternet-based products and services, as well\nas our usage of mobile and cloud technologies\nand as we provide more of these services to a\ngreater number of retail banking customers.\n\nThe methods and techniques employed by\nmalicious actors change frequently, are\nincreasingly sophisticated and often are not\nfully recognized or understood until after\nthey have occurred, and some techniques could\noccur and persist for an extended period of\ntime before being detected and remediated. For\nexample, although we immediately fixed the\nconfiguration vulnerability that was exploited\nin the Cybersecurity Incident once we\ndiscovered the unauthorized access, a period\nof time elapsed between the occurrence of the\nunauthorized access and the time when we\ndiscovered it. In other circumstances, we and\nour service providers and other third parties\nwith which we interact may be unable to\nanticipate or identify certain attack methods\nor techniques in order to implement effective\npreventative or detective measures or mitigate\nor remediate the damages caused in a timely\nmanner. We may also be unable to hire, develop\nand retain talent that keeps pace with the\nrapidly changing cyber threat landscape, and\nwhich are capable of preventing, detecting,\nmitigating or remediating these risks.\nAlthough we seek to maintain a robust suite of\nauthentication and layered information\nsecurity controls, any one or combination of\nthese controls could fail to prevent, detect,\nmitigate or remediate these risks in a timely\nmanner.\n\nA disruption or breach, including as a result\nof a cyber-attack such as the Cybersecurity\nIncident, or media reports of perceived\nsecurity vulnerabilities at Capital One or at\nour service providers, could result in\nsignificant legal and financial exposure,\nregulatory intervention, litigation,\nremediation costs, card reissuance,\nsupervisory liability, damage to our\nreputation or loss of confidence in the\nsecurity of our systems, products and services\nthat could adversely affect our business.\nThere can be no assurance that unauthorized\naccess or cyber incidents similar to the\nCybersecurity Incident will not occur or that\nwe will not suffer material losses in the\nfuture. If future attacks are successful or if\ncustomers are unable to access their accounts\nonline for other reasons, it could adversely\nimpact our ability to service customer\naccounts or loans, complete financial\ntransactions for our customers or otherwise\noperate any of our businesses or services. In\naddition, a breach or attack affecting one of\nour service providers or other third parties\nwith which we interact could harm our business\neven if we do not control the service that is\nattacked.\n\nFurther, our ability to monitor our service\nproviders\u2019 cybersecurity practices is limited.\nAlthough the agreements that we have in place\nwith our service providers generally include\nrequirements relating to cybersecurity and\ndata privacy, we cannot guarantee that such\nagreements will prevent a cyber incident\nimpacting our systems or information or enable\nus to obtain adequate or any reimbursement\nfrom our service providers in the event we\nshould suffer any such incidents. However, due\nto\n                                              \n  29    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\napplicable laws and regulations or contractual\nobligations, we may be held responsible for\ncyber incidents attributed to our service\nproviders as they relate to the information we\nshare with them.\n\nIn addition, the increasing prevalence and the\nevolution of cyber-attacks and other efforts\nto breach or disrupt our systems or networks\nor those of our customers, service providers,\npartners or other third parties with which we\ninteract has led, and will likely continue to\nlead, to increased costs to us with respect to\npreventing, detecting, mitigating and\nremediating these risks, as well as any\nrelated attempted fraud. In order to address\nongoing and future risks, we must expend\nsignificant resources to support protective\nsecurity measures, investigate and remediate\nany vulnerabilities of our information systems\nand infrastructure and invest in new\ntechnology designed to mitigate security\nrisks. Further, high profile cyber incidents\nat Capital One or other large financial\ninstitutions could lead to a general loss of\ncustomer confidence in financial institutions\nthat could negatively affect us, including\nharming the market perception of the\neffectiveness of our security measures or the\nglobal financial system in general, which\ncould result in reduced use of our financial\nproducts. We have insurance against some cyber\nrisks and attacks; nonetheless, our insurance\ncoverage may not be sufficient to offset the\nimpact of a material loss event (including if\nour insurer denies coverage as to any\nparticular claim in the future), and such\ninsurance may increase in cost or cease to be\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, or\nat all, in the future.\n\nOur required compliance with applicable laws\nand regulations related to privacy, data\nprotection and data security may increase our\ncosts, reduce our revenue, increase our legal\nexposure and limit our ability to pursue\nbusiness opportunities.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of continuously\nevolving and developing laws and regulations\nin the United States at the federal, state and\nlocal level regarding privacy, data protection\nand data security, including those related to\nthe collection, storage, handling, use,\ndisclosure, transfer, security and other\nprocessing of personal information. For\nexample, at the federal level, we are subject\nto the GLBA, among other laws and regulations.\nMoreover, the U.S. Congress is currently\nconsidering various proposals for more\ncomprehensive privacy, data protection and\ndata security legislation, to which we may be\nsubject if passed. In addition, in November\n2021, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC\nissued a final rule that, among other things,\nrequires all banking organizations in the\nUnited States to notify their primary federal\nregulators of certain material computer-\nsecurity incidents as soon as possible and no\nlater than 36 hours after determining that the\nincident has occurred. The enactment of\nCIRCIA, once rulemaking is complete, will\nrequire, among other things, certain companies\nto report significant cyber incidents to the\nCISA within 72 hours from the time the company\nreasonably believes the incident occurred, and\na proposed rule by the SEC, if enacted, would\nmandate public disclosure of material\ncybersecurity incidents within four business\ndays of determining that such an incident has\noccurred. At the state level, California has\nenacted the California Privacy Rights Act\n(\u201cCPRA\u201d), and various other states also have\nenacted or are in the process of enacting\nstate-level privacy, data protection and/or\ndata security laws and regulations, with which\nwe may be required to comply.\n\nWe also are, or may become, subject to\ncontinuously evolving and developing laws and\nregulations in other jurisdictions regarding\nprivacy, data protection and data security.\nFor example, in Canada we are subject to the\nPersonal Information Protection and Electronic\nDocuments Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d). In addition, subject\nto limited exceptions, the EU General Data\nProjection Regulation (\u201cEU GDPR\u201d) applies EU\ndata protection law to all companies\nprocessing personal data of EU residents,\nregardless of the company\u2019s location. We also\nare subject to the UK General Data Protection\nRegulation (\u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d), which is how the EU\nGDPR has been implemented into U.K. law. These\nlaws and regulations, and similar laws and\nregulations in other jurisdictions, impose\nstrict requirements regarding the collection,\nstorage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer,\nsecurity and other processing of personal\ninformation, which may have adverse\nconsequences, including significant compliance\ncosts and severe monetary penalties for non-\ncompliance. Significant uncertainty exists as\nprivacy, data protection, and data security\nlaws may be interpreted and applied\ndifferently from country to country and may\ncreate inconsistent or conflicting\nrequirements.\n\nFurther, we make public statements about our\nuse, collection, disclosure and other\nprocessing of personal information through our\nprivacy policies, information provided on our\nwebsite and press statements. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our public statements\nand documentation, we may at times fail to do\nso or be alleged to have failed to do so. The\npublication of our privacy policies and other\nstatements that provide promises and\nassurances about privacy, data protection and\ndata security can subject us to potential\ngovernment or legal action if they are found\nto be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative\nof our actual practices.\n\nOur efforts to comply with GLBA, CPRA, PIPEDA,\nEU GDPR, U.K. GDPR and other privacy, data\nprotection and data security laws and\nregulations, as well as our posted privacy\npolicies, and related contractual obligations\nto third parties, entail substantial expenses,\nmay divert resources from other initiatives\nand projects, and could limit the services we\nare able to offer. Furthermore, enforcement\nactions and investigations by regulatory\nauthorities related to data security incidents\nand privacy, data protection and data security\nviolations continue to increase. The enactment\nof more restrictive laws or regulations, or\nfuture\n                                              \n  30    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nenforcement actions or investigations, could\nimpact us through increased costs or\nrestrictions on our business, and any\nnoncompliance or perceived noncompliance could\nresult in monetary or other penalties, harm to\nour reputation and significant legal\nliability.\n\nWe face risks resulting from the extensive use\nof models and data.\n\nWe rely on quantitative models and our ability\nto manage and aggregate data in an accurate\nand timely manner to assess and manage our\nvarious risk exposures, create estimates and\nforecasts, and manage compliance with\nregulatory capital requirements. Models may be\nused in processes such as determining the\npricing of various products, grading loans and\nextending credit, measuring interest rate and\nother market risks, predicting deposit levels\nor loan losses, assessing capital adequacy,\ncalculating managerial and regulatory capital\nlevels, estimating the value of financial\ninstruments and balance sheet items, and other\noperational functions. Our risk reporting and\nmanagement, including business decisions based\non information incorporating models, depend on\nthe effectiveness of our models and our\npolicies, programs, processes and practices\ngoverning how data or models, as applicable,\nare acquired, validated, stored, protected,\nprocessed and analyzed. Any issues with the\nquality or effectiveness of our data\naggregation and validation procedures, as well\nas the quality and integrity of data inputs,\nformulas or algorithms, could result in\ninaccurate forecasts, ineffective risk\nmanagement practices or inaccurate risk\nreporting. In addition, models based on\nhistorical data sets might not be accurate\npredictors of future outcomes and their\nability to appropriately predict future\noutcomes may degrade over time. While we\ncontinuously update our policies, programs,\nprocesses and practices, many of our data\nmanagement, modeling, aggregation and\nimplementation processes are manual and may be\nsubject to human error, data limitations,\nprocess delays or system failure. Failure to\nmanage data effectively and to aggregate data\nin an accurate and timely manner may limit our\nability to manage current and emerging risk,\nto produce accurate financial, regulatory and\noperational reporting as well as to manage\nchanging business needs. If our Framework is\nineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses\nwhich could materially adversely affect our\nresults of operation or financial condition.\nAlso, any information we provide to the public\nor to our regulators based on poorly designed\nor implemented models could be inaccurate or\nmisleading. Some of the decisions that our\nregulators make, including those related to\ncapital distribution to our stockholders,\ncould be affected adversely due to the\nperception that the quality of the models used\nto generate the relevant information is\ninsufficient.\n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Risk                   \n                                              \nCompliance with new and existing laws,\nregulations and regulatory expectations is\ncostly and complex.\n\nA wide array of laws and regulations,\nincluding banking and consumer lending laws\nand regulations, apply to every aspect of our\nbusiness. We and our subsidiaries are also\nsubject to supervision and examination by\nmultiple regulators, and the manner in which\nour regulators interpret applicable laws and\nregulations may affect how we comply with\nthem. Failure to comply with these laws and\nregulations, even if the failure was\ninadvertent or reflects a difference in\ninterpretation, could subject us to\nrestrictions on our business activities,\nfines, criminal sanctions and other penalties,\nand/or damage to our reputation with\nregulators, our customers or the public.\nHiring, training and retaining qualified\ncompliance and legal personnel, and\nestablishing and maintaining risk management\nand compliance-related systems, infrastructure\nand processes, is difficult and may lead to\nincreased expenses. These efforts and the\nassociated costs could limit our ability to\ninvest in other business opportunities.\n\nApplicable rules and regulations may affect us\ndisproportionately compared to our competitors\nor in an unforeseen manner. For example, we\nhave a large number of customer accounts in\nour credit card and auto lending businesses\nand we have made the strategic choice to\noriginate and service subprime credit card and\nauto loans, which typically have higher\ndelinquencies and charge-offs than prime\ncustomer accounts. As a result, we have\nsignificant involvement with credit bureau\nreporting and the collection and recovery of\ndelinquent and charged-off debt, primarily\nthrough customer communications, the filing of\nlitigation against customers in default, the\nperiodic sale of charged-off debt and vehicle\nrepossession. These and other consumer lending\nactivities are subject to enhanced legal and\nregulatory scrutiny from regulators, courts\nand legislators. Any future changes to or\nlegal liabilities resulting from our business\npractices in these areas, including our debt\ncollection practices and the fees we charge,\nwhether mandated by regulators, courts,\nlegislators or otherwise, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our financial\ncondition.\n\nThe legislative and regulatory environment is\nbeyond our control, may change rapidly and\nunpredictably, and may negatively influence\nour revenue, costs, earnings, growth,\nliquidity and capital levels. For example,\nthere may be future rulemaking in emerging\nregulatory areas such as climate-related risks\nand new technologies. In addition, some rules\nand regulations may be subject to litigation\nor other challenges that delay or modify their\nimplementation and impact on us. Adoption of\nnew technologies, such as distributed ledger\ntechnologies, tokenization, cloud computing,\nartificial intelligence and machine learning\ntechnologies, can present unforeseen\nchallenges in applying and relying on existing\ncompliance systems.\n                                              \n  31    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nCertain laws and regulations, and any\ninterpretations and applications with respect\nthereto, are generally intended to protect\nconsumers, borrowers, depositors, the DIF, the\nU.S. banking and financial system, and\nfinancial markets as a whole, but not\nstockholders. Our success depends on our\nability to maintain compliance with both\nexisting and new laws and regulations. For a\ndescription of the material laws and\nregulations, including those related to the\nconsumer lending business, to which we are\nsubject, see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\n\nOur businesses are subject to the risk of\nincreased litigation, government\ninvestigations and regulatory enforcement.\n\nOur businesses are subject to increased\nlitigation, government investigations and\nother regulatory enforcement risks as a result\nof a number of factors and from various\nsources, including the highly regulated nature\nof the financial services industry, the focus\nof state and federal prosecutors on banks and\nthe financial services industry and the\nstructure of the credit card industry.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties involved in\nlitigation, government investigations and\nregulatory enforcement decisions, and the very\nlarge or indeterminate damages sought in some\nmatters asserted against us, there can be\nsignificant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these kinds of\nmatters. The finding, or even the assertion,\nof substantial legal liability against us\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial condition and could\ncause significant reputational harm to us,\nwhich could seriously harm our business. For\nexample, the Cybersecurity Incident has\nresulted in litigation, settlements,\ngovernment investigations and other regulatory\nenforcement inquiries.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions, such as\nourselves, face significant regulatory\nscrutiny, which can lead to public enforcement\nactions or nonpublic supervisory actions. We\nand our subsidiaries are subject to\ncomprehensive regulation and periodic\nexamination by, among other regulatory bodies,\nthe Federal Banking Agencies, SEC, CFTC and\nCFPB. We have been subject to enforcement\nactions by many of these and other regulators\nand may continue to be involved in such\nactions, including governmental inquiries,\ninvestigations and enforcement proceedings,\nincluding by the OCC, Department of Justice,\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(\u201cFinCEN\u201d) and state Attorneys General.\n\nOver the last several years, federal and state\nregulators have focused on compliance with AML\nand sanctions laws, privacy, data protection\nand data security, use of service providers,\nfair lending and other consumer protection\nissues. In August 2020, we entered into\nconsent orders with the Federal Reserve and\nthe OCC resulting from regulatory reviews of\nthe Cybersecurity Incident and relating to\nongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and\noperational risk management processes, and we\npaid a civil monetary penalty as part of the\nOCC agreement. On August 31, 2022, the OCC\nterminated its consent order. In January 2021,\nwe also paid a civil monetary penalty assessed\nby FinCEN against the Bank in connection with\nAML violations alleged to have occurred\nbetween 2008 and 2014. Regulatory scrutiny is\nexpected to continue in these areas, including\nas a result of implementation of the AML Act\nof 2020.\n\nWe expect that regulators and governmental\nenforcement bodies will continue taking public\nenforcement actions against financial\ninstitutions in addition to addressing\nsupervisory concerns through nonpublic\nsupervisory actions or findings, which could\ninvolve restrictions on our activities, or our\nability to make acquisitions or otherwise\nexpand our business, among other limitations\nthat could adversely affect our business. In\naddition, a violation of law or regulation by\nanother financial institution is likely to\ngive rise to an investigation by regulators\nand other governmental agencies of the same or\nsimilar practices by us. Furthermore, a single\nevent may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings.\nThese and other initiatives from governmental\nauthorities and officials may subject us to\nfurther judgments, settlements, fines or\npenalties, or cause us to restructure our\noperations and activities or to cease offering\ncertain products or services, all of which\ncould harm our reputation or lead to higher\noperational costs. Litigation, government\ninvestigations and other regulatory actions\ncould generally subject us to significant\nfines, increased expenses, restrictions on our\nactivities and damage to our reputation and\nour brand, and could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations. For additional information\nregarding legal and regulatory proceedings to\nwhich we are subject, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u2014Note 18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies,\nGuarantees and Others.\u201d\n                                              \n   Other Business Risks                       \n                                              \nWe face intense competition in all of our\nmarkets.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment\nacross all of our lines of business, whether\nin making loans, attracting deposits or in the\nglobal payments industry, and we expect\ncompetitive conditions to continue to\nintensify with respect to most of our products\nparticularly in our credit card and consumer\nbanking business. We compete on the basis of\nthe rates we pay on deposits and the rates and\nother terms we charge on the loans we\noriginate or purchase, as well as the quality\nand range of our\n                                              \n  32    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ncustomer service, products, innovation and\nexperience. This increasingly competitive\nenvironment is primarily a result of changes\nin technology, product delivery systems and\nregulation, as well as the emergence of new or\nsignificantly larger financial services\nproviders, all of which may affect our\ncustomers\u2019 expectations and demands. In\naddition to offering competitive products and\nservices, we invest in and conduct marketing\ncampaigns to attract and inform customers. If\nour marketing campaigns are unsuccessful, it\nmay adversely impact our ability to attract\nnew customers and grow market share.\n\nSome of our competitors, including new and\nemerging competitors in the digital and mobile\npayments space and other financial technology\nproviders, are not subject to the same\nregulatory requirements or scrutiny to which\nwe are subject, which also could place us at a\ncompetitive disadvantage, in particular in the\ndevelopment of new technology platforms or the\nability to rapidly innovate. We compete with\nmany forms of payments offered by both bank\nand non-bank providers, including a variety of\nnew and evolving alternative payment\nmechanisms, systems and products, such as\naggregators and web-based and wireless payment\nplatforms or technologies, digital or\ncryptocurrencies, prepaid systems and payment\nservices targeting users of social networks,\ncommunications platforms and online gaming. If\nwe are unable to continue to keep pace with\ninnovation, do not effectively market our\nproducts and services or are prohibited from\nor unwilling to enter emerging areas of\ncompetition, our business and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\n\nSome of our competitors are substantially\nlarger than we are, which may give those\ncompetitors advantages, including a more\ndiversified product and customer base, the\nability to reach more customers and potential\ncustomers, operational efficiencies, broad-\nbased local distribution capabilities, lower-\ncost funding and larger existing branch\nnetworks. Many of our competitors are also\nfocusing on cross-selling their products and\ndeveloping new products or technologies, which\ncould affect our ability to maintain or grow\nexisting customer relationships or require us\nto offer lower interest rates or fees on our\nlending products or higher interest rates on\ndeposits. Competition for loans could result\nin origination of fewer loans, earning less on\nour loans or an increase in loans that perform\nbelow expectations.\n\nWe operate as an online direct bank in the\nUnited States. While direct banking provides a\nsignificant opportunity to attract new\ncustomers that value greater and more flexible\naccess to banking services at reduced costs,\nwe face strong and increasing competition in\nthe direct banking market. Aggressive pricing\nthroughout the industry may adversely affect\nthe retention of existing balances and the\ncost-efficient acquisition of new deposit\nfunds and may affect our growth and\nprofitability. Customers could also close\ntheir online accounts or reduce balances or\ndeposits in favor of products and services\noffered by competitors for other reasons.\nThese shifts, which could be rapid, could\nresult from general dissatisfaction with our\nproducts or services, including concerns over\npricing, online security or our reputation.\nThe potential consequences of this competitive\nenvironment are exacerbated by the flexibility\nof direct banking and the financial and\ntechnological sophistication of our online\ncustomer base.\n\nIn our credit card business, competition for\nrewards customers may result in higher rewards\nexpenses, or we may fail to attract new\ncustomers or retain existing rewards customers\ndue to increasing competition for these\nconsumers. As of December 31, 2022, we have a\nnumber of large partnerships in our credit\ncard loan portfolio. The market for key\nbusiness partners, especially in the credit\ncard business, is very competitive, and we may\nnot be able to grow or maintain these partner\nrelationships or assure that these\nrelationships will be profitable or valued by\nour customers. Additionally, partners\nthemselves may face changes in their business,\nincluding market factors and ownership\nchanges, that could impact the partnership. We\nface the risk that we could lose partner\nrelationships, even after we have invested\nsignificant resources into acquiring and\ndeveloping the relationships. The loss of key\nbusiness partners could have a negative impact\non our results of operations, including lower\nreturns, excess operating expense and excess\nfunding capacity.\n\nWe depend on our partners to effectively\npromote our co-brand and private label\nproducts and integrate the use of our credit\ncards into their retail operations. The\nfailure by our partners to effectively promote\nand support our products as well as changes\nthey may make in their business models could\nadversely affect card usage and our ability to\nachieve the growth and profitability\nobjectives of our partnerships. In addition,\nif our partners do not adhere to the terms of\nour program agreements and standards, or\notherwise diminish the value of our brand, we\nmay suffer reputational damage and customers\nmay be less likely to use our products.\n\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may\ndevelop, substantially greater financial and\nother resources than we have, may offer richer\nvalue propositions or a wider range of\nprograms and services than we offer, or may\nuse more effective advertising, marketing or\ncross-selling strategies to acquire and retain\nmore customers, capture a greater share of\nspending and borrowings, attain and develop\nmore attractive co-brand card programs and\nmaintain greater merchant acceptance than we\nhave. We may not be able to compete\neffectively against these threats or respond\nor adapt to changes in consumer spending\nhabits as effectively as our competitors.\n                                              \n  33    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nIn such a competitive environment, we may lose\nentire accounts or may lose account balances\nto competing firms, or we may find it more\ncostly to maintain our existing customer base.\nCustomer attrition from any or all of our\nlending products, together with any lowering\nof interest rates or fees that we might\nimplement to retain customers, could reduce\nour revenues and therefore our earnings.\nSimilarly, unexpected customer attrition from\nour deposit products, in addition to an\nincrease in rates or services that we may\noffer to retain deposits, may increase our\nexpenses and therefore reduce our earnings.\n\nOur business, financial condition and results\nof operations may be adversely affected by\nmerchants\u2019 increasing focus on the fees\ncharged by credit and debit card networks and\nby legislation and regulation impacting such\nfees.\n\nInterchange fees are generally one of the\nlargest components of the costs that merchants\npay in connection with the acceptance of\ncredit and debit cards and are a meaningful\nsource of revenue for our credit and debit\ncard businesses. Interchange fees are the\nsubject of significant and intense global\nlegal, legislative and regulatory focus, and\nthe resulting decisions, legislation and\nregulation may have a material adverse impact\non our overall business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\n\nLegislative and regulatory bodies in a number\nof countries are seeking to reduce interchange\nfees through legislation, competition-related\nregulatory proceedings, voluntary agreements,\ncentral bank regulation and/or litigation. For\ncredit transactions, interchange reimbursement\nrates in the United States are set by credit\ncard networks such as MasterCard and Visa. For\ndebit transactions, Federal Reserve rules\nplace limits on the interchange fees we may\ncharge. For more information on these rules,\nplease see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation.\u201d In some\njurisdictions, such as Canada and certain\ncountries in Europe, including the U.K.,\ninterchange fees and related practices are\nsubject to regulatory activity, including in\nsome cases, imposing caps on permissible\ninterchange fees. Our international card\nbusinesses have been impacted by these\nrestrictions. For example, in the U.K.,\ninterchange fees are capped for both credit\nand debit card transactions. In addition, in\nCanada, Visa and Mastercard payment networks\nhave entered into voluntary agreements with\nthe Department of Finance Canada to maintain\nan agreed upon average interchange rate.\nLowering interchange fees remains an area of\ndomestic and international governmental focus.\nLegislators and regulators around the world\nare aware of each other\u2019s approaches to the\nregulation of the payments industry.\nConsequently, a development in one country,\nstate or region may influence regulatory\napproaches in another, such as our primary\nmarket, the United States.\n\nIn addition to this regulatory activity,\nmerchants are also seeking avenues to reduce\ninterchange fees. In the past, merchants and\ntheir trade groups have filed numerous\nlawsuits against Visa, MasterCard, American\nExpress and their card-issuing banks, claiming\nthat their practices toward merchants,\nincluding interchange and similar fees,\nviolate federal antitrust laws. In 2005, a\nnumber of entities filed antitrust lawsuits\nagainst MasterCard and Visa and several member\nbanks, including our subsidiaries and us,\nalleging among other things, that the\ndefendants conspired to fix the level of\ninterchange fees. In December 2013, the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork granted final approval of the proposed\nclass settlement. The settlement provided,\namong other things, that merchants would be\nentitled to join together to negotiate lower\ninterchange fees. The settlement was appealed\nto the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which\nrejected the settlement in June 2016; a\nrevised settlement was reached in the second\nhalf of 2018, and the trial court issued its\nfinal approval of the settlement in December\n2019. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8. Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note\n18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and\nOthers\u201d for further details.\n\nSome major retailers have sufficient\nbargaining power to independently negotiate\nlower interchange fees with MasterCard and\nVisa, which could, in turn, result in lower\ninterchange fees for us when our cardholders\nundertake purchase transactions with these\nretailers. Merchants also continue to lobby\nCongress aggressively for restrictions on\ninterchange fees and their efforts may be\nsuccessful. Retailers may in the future bring\nlegal proceedings against us or other credit\ncard and debit card issuers and networks.\n\nBeyond pursuing litigation, legislation and\nregulation, merchants may also promote forms\nof payment with lower fees, such as ACH-based\npayments, or seek to impose surcharges at the\npoint of sale for use of credit or debit\ncards. New payment systems, particularly\nmobile-based payment technologies, could also\ngain widespread adoption and lead to issuer\ntransaction fees or the displacement of credit\ncard accounts as a payment method.\n\nThe heightened focus by merchants and\nlegislative and regulatory bodies on the fees\ncharged by credit and debit card networks, and\nthe ability of certain merchants to\nsuccessfully negotiate discounts to\ninterchange fees with MasterCard and Visa or\ndevelop alternative payment systems, could\nresult in a reduction of interchange fees. Any\nresulting loss in income to us could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n                                              \n  34    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in\nand introduce digital and other technological\ndevelopments across all our businesses, our\nfinancial performance may suffer.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and\nsignificant technological changes and our\nability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and\nexpectations is key to our ability to grow\nrevenue and earnings. We expect digital\ntechnologies to continue to have a significant\nimpact on banking over time. Consumers expect\nrobust digital experiences from their\nfinancial services providers. The ability for\ncustomers to access their accounts and conduct\nfinancial transactions using digital\ntechnology, including mobile applications, is\nan important aspect of the financial services\nindustry and financial institutions are\nrapidly introducing new digital and other\ntechnology-driven products and services that\naim to offer a better customer experience and\nto reduce costs. We continue to invest in\ndigital technology designed to attract new\ncustomers, facilitate the ability of existing\ncustomers to conduct financial transactions\nand enhance the customer experience related to\nour products and services.\n\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon\nour ability to assess and address the needs of\nour customers by using digital technology to\nprovide products and services that meet their\nexpectations. The development and launch of\nnew digital products and services depends in\nlarge part on our ability to invest in and\nbuild the technology platforms that can enable\nthem, in a cost effective and timely manner.\nSee \u201c We face intense competition in all of\nour markets \u201d and \u201c We face risks related to\nour operational, technological and\norganizational infrastructure. \u201d\n\nSome of our competitors are substantially\nlarger than we are, which may allow those\ncompetitors to invest more money into their\ntechnology infrastructure and digital\ninnovation than we do. In addition, smaller\ncompetitors may experience lower cost\nstructures and different regulatory\nrequirements and scrutiny than we do, which\nmay allow them to innovate more rapidly than\nwe can. See \u201c We face intense competition in\nall of our markets. \u201d Further, our success\ndepends on our ability to attract and retain\nstrong digital and technology leaders,\nengineers and other specialized personnel. The\ncompetition is intense and the compensation\ncosts continue to increase for such talent. If\nwe are unable to attract and retain digital\nand technology talent, our ability to offer\ndigital products and services and build the\nnecessary technology infrastructure could be\nnegatively affected, which could negatively\nimpact our business and financial results. A\nfailure to maintain or enhance our competitive\nposition with respect to digital products and\nservices, whether because we fail to\nanticipate customer expectations or because\nour technological developments fail to perform\nas desired or are not implemented in a timely\nor successful manner, could negatively impact\nour business and financial results.\n\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of our mergers, acquisitions and\nstrategic partnerships.\n\nWe engage in merger and acquisition activity\nand enter into strategic partnerships from\ntime to time. We continue to evaluate and\nanticipate engaging in, among other merger and\nacquisition activity, additional strategic\npartnerships and selected acquisitions of\nfinancial institutions and other businesses or\nassets, including credit card and other loan\nportfolios. We may not be able to identify and\nsecure future acquisition targets on terms and\nconditions that are acceptable to us, or\nsuccessfully complete and integrate the\nbusinesses within the anticipated time frame\nand achieve the anticipated benefits of\nproposed mergers, acquisitions and strategic\npartnerships, which could impair our growth.\n\nAny merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership we undertake entails certain\nrisks, which may materially and adversely\naffect our results of operations. If we\nexperience greater than anticipated costs to\nintegrate acquired businesses into our\nexisting operations, or are not able to\nachieve the anticipated benefits of any\nmerger, acquisition or strategic partnership,\nincluding cost savings and other synergies,\nour business could be negatively affected. In\naddition, it is possible that the ongoing\nintegration processes could result in the loss\nof key employees, errors or delays in systems\nimplementation, exposure to cybersecurity\nrisks associated with acquired businesses,\nexposure to additional regulatory oversight,\nthe disruption of our ongoing businesses or\ninconsistencies in standards, controls,\nprocedures and policies that adversely affect\nour ability to maintain relationships with\npartners, clients, customers, depositors and\nemployees or to achieve the anticipated\nbenefits of any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership.

We may be unable to\nprofitably deploy any assets we acquire.\n\n\u2022 Accuracy of Assumptions: In connection with\nany merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership, we may make certain assumptions\nrelating to the proposed merger, acquisition\nor strategic partnership that may be, or may\nprove to be, inaccurate, including as a result\nof the failure to anticipate the costs,\ntimeline or ability to realize the expected\nbenefits of any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership. The inaccuracy of any\nassumptions we may make could result in\nunanticipated consequences that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of\noperations or financial condition.\n\n\u2022 Target-specific Risk: Assets and companies\nthat we acquire, or companies that we enter\ninto strategic partnerships with, will have\ntheir own risks that are specific to a\nparticular asset or company. These risks\ninclude, but are not limited to, particular or\nspecific regulatory, accounting, operational,\nreputational and industry risks, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nFor example, we may face challenges associated\nwith integrating other companies due to\ndifferences in corporate culture, compliance\nsystems or standards of conduct.\nIndemnification rights, if any, may be\ninsufficient to compensate us for any losses\nor damages resulting from such risks. In\naddition to regulatory approvals discussed\nbelow, certain of our merger, acquisition or\npartnership activity may require third-party\nconsents in order for us to fully realize the\nanticipated benefits of any such transaction.\n\n\u2022 Conditions to Regulatory Approval: We may be\nrequired to obtain various governmental and\nregulatory approvals to consummate certain\nacquisitions. We cannot be certain whether,\nwhen or on what terms and conditions, such\napprovals may be granted. Consequently, we may\nnot obtain governmental or regulatory approval\nfor a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms\nor at all, in which case we would not be able\nto complete the acquisition despite investing\nresources in pursuing it.\n\nReputational risk and social factors may\nimpact our results and damage our brand.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers is\nhighly dependent upon the perceptions of\nconsumer and commercial borrowers and deposit\nholders and other external perceptions of our\nproducts, services, trustworthiness, business\npractices, workplace culture, compliance\npractices or our financial health. In\naddition, our brand is very important to us.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand depends\nlargely on our ability to continue to provide\nhigh-quality products and services. Adverse\nperceptions regarding our reputation in the\nconsumer, commercial and funding markets could\nlead to difficulties in generating and\nmaintaining accounts as well as in financing\nthem. In particular, negative public\nperceptions regarding our reputation,\nincluding negative perceptions regarding our\nability to maintain the security of our\ntechnology systems and protect customer data,\ncould lead to decreases in the levels of\ndeposits that consumer and commercial\ncustomers and potential customers choose to\nmaintain with us or significantly increase the\ncosts of attracting and retaining customers.\nIn addition, negative perceptions regarding\ncertain industries, partners or clients could\nalso prompt us to cease business activities\nassociated with those entities.\n\nNegative public opinion or damage to our brand\ncould also result from actual or alleged\nconduct in any number of activities or\ncircumstances, including lending practices,\nregulatory compliance, security breaches\n(including the use and protection of customer\ndata, such as resulting from the Cybersecurity\nIncident), corporate governance and sales and\nmarketing, and from actions taken by\nregulators or other persons in response to\nsuch conduct. Such conduct could fall short of\nour customers\u2019 and the public\u2019s heightened\nexpectations of companies of our size with\nrigorous privacy, data protection, data\nsecurity and compliance practices, and could\nfurther harm our reputation. In addition, our\nco-brand and private label partners or other\nthird parties with whom we have important\nrelationships may take actions over which we\nhave limited control that could negatively\nimpact perceptions about us or the financial\nservices industry. The proliferation of social\nmedia may increase the likelihood that\nnegative public opinion from any of the events\ndiscussed above will impact our reputation and\nbusiness.\n\nIn addition, a variety of social factors may\ncause changes in borrowing activity, including\ncredit card use, payment patterns and the rate\nof defaults by account holders and borrowers\ndomestically and internationally. These social\nfactors include changes in consumer confidence\nlevels, the public\u2019s perception regarding the\nbanking industry and consumer debt, including\ncredit card use, and changing attitudes about\nthe stigma of bankruptcy. There has also been\nincreased focus by investor advocacy groups,\ninvestment funds and shareholder activists,\namong others, on topics related to\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance\n                                              \n  36    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\npolicies, and our policies, practices and\ndisclosure in these areas, including related\nto climate change. If these groups consider\nour efforts unsatisfactory, whether real or\nperceived, it could also harm our reputation.\nIf consumers develop or maintain negative\nattitudes about incurring debt, or consumption\ntrends decline or if we fail to maintain and\nenhance our brand, or we incur significant\nexpenses to do so, our reputation and business\nand financial results could be materially and\nnegatively affected.\n\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual\nproperty, our revenue and profitability could\nbe negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect\nand enhance our intellectual property,\nincluding copyrights, trademarks, trade\nsecrets, patents and certain restrictions on\ndisclosure, solicitation and competition. We\nalso undertake other measures to control\naccess to and distribution of our other\nproprietary and confidential information.\nThese measures may not prevent\nmisappropriation of our proprietary or\nconfidential information or infringement,\nmisappropriation or other violations of our\nintellectual property rights and a resulting\nloss of competitive advantage. In addition,\nour competitors or other third parties may\nobtain patents for innovations that are used\nin our industry or allege that our systems,\nprocesses or technologies infringe,\nmisappropriate or violate their intellectual\nproperty rights. Given the complex, rapidly\nchanging and competitive technological and\nbusiness environments in which we operate, if\nour competitors or other third parties are\nsuccessful in obtaining such patents or\nprevail in intellectual property-related\nlitigation against us, we could lose\nsignificant revenues, incur significant\nlicense, royalty, technology development or\nother expenses, or pay significant damages.\n\nOur risk management strategies may not be\nfully effective in mitigating our risk\nexposures in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk.\n\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity,\nstrategic, reputational, operational and\ncompliance risk requires, among other things,\npolicies and procedures to properly record and\nverify a large number of transactions and\nevents. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7. MD&A\u2014Risk\nManagement\u201d for further details. We maintain\nan enterprise Framework that is designed to\nidentify, measure, assess, monitor, test,\ncontrol, report, escalate, and mitigate the\nrisks that we face. Even though we continue to\ndevote significant resources to developing our\nFramework, our risk management strategies may\nnot be fully effective in identifying and\nmitigating our risk exposure in all market\nenvironments or against all types of risk,\nincluding risks that are unidentified or\nunanticipated.\n\nSome of our methods of managing these risks\nare based upon our use of observed historical\nmarket behavior, the use of analytical and/or\nforecasting models and management\u2019s judgment.\nThese methods may not accurately predict\nfuture exposures, which could be significantly\ngreater than the historical measures or models\nindicate and market conditions, particularly\nduring a period of financial market stress,\ncan involve unprecedented dislocations. For\nexample, credit risk is inherent in the\nfinancial services business and results from,\namong other things, extending credit to\ncustomers. Our ability to assess the\ncreditworthiness of our customers may be\nimpaired if the models and approaches we use\nto select, manage and underwrite our consumer\nand commercial customers become less\npredictive of future charge-offs due, for\nexample, to rapid changes in the economy, or\ndegradation in the predictive nature of credit\nbureau and other data used in underwriting.\n\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of\nrisk monitoring and risk mitigation\ntechniques, those techniques and the judgments\nthat accompany their application cannot\nanticipate every economic and financial\noutcome or the timing of such outcomes. For\nexample, our ability to implement our risk\nmanagement strategies may be hindered by\nadverse changes in the volatility or liquidity\nconditions in certain markets and as a result,\nmay limit our ability to distribute such risks\n(for instance, when we seek to syndicate\nexposure in bridge financing transactions we\nhave underwritten). We may, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course of our risk management or\ninvesting activities.\n\nThe transition away from LIBOR may adversely\naffect our business.\n\nA transition away from the use of LIBOR to\nalternative rates and other potential interest\nrate benchmark reforms is not yet complete.\nThese reforms have caused and may in the\nfuture cause such rates to perform differently\nthan in the past, or to disappear entirely, or\nhave other consequences which cannot be\npredicted.\n\nGiven LIBOR\u2019s extensive use across financial\nmarkets, the ongoing transition away from\nLIBOR presents several risks and challenges to\nthe financial markets and financial\ninstitutions, including Capital One. While we\nhave substantially decreased our exposure to\nLIBOR, we have certain loans, derivative\ncontracts, securitizations, and other\ncontracts with attributes that are either\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. Our\nability to transition those exposures away\nfrom LIBOR could be affected by market and\ncustomer acceptance of and the specific terms\nand parameters for alternative reference\nrates. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d) has been recommended by the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d)\nas an alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR.\nNevertheless, the transition away from LIBOR\ncould result in loss of market share in\ncertain\n                                              \n  37    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nproducts, adverse tax or accounting impacts,\ncompliance, legal or operational costs and\nrisks associated with client disclosures, as\nwell as systems disruption, model disruption\nand other business continuity issues for us.\n\nIn addition, risks will remain for us with\nrespect to outstanding instruments which rely\non LIBOR. Those risks arise in connection with\ntransitioning such instruments to a new\nreference rate, the taking of discretionary\nactions (for example, under fallback\nprovisions) or the negotiation of fallback\nprovisions and final amendments to existing\nLIBOR based agreements. Payments under\ncontracts referencing new reference rates may\nsignificantly differ from those referencing\nLIBOR. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR)\nAct passed by Congress in March 2022 (\u201cLIBOR\nAct\u201d) is intended to minimize legal and\neconomic uncertainty following U.S. dollar\nLIBOR\u2019s cessation by replacing LIBOR\nreferences in certain contracts under certain\ncircumstances with a SOFR-based rate\nidentified in a Federal Reserve rule that\nincorporates a spread adjustment specified in\nthe statute. For some instruments, the method\nof transitioning to a new reference rate may\nbe challenging, especially if parties to an\ninstrument cannot agree as to how to effect\nthat transition and the LIBOR Act does not\napply. In addition, prior to LIBOR cessation,\ninstruments that continue to refer to LIBOR\nmay be impacted if there is a change in the\navailability or calculation of LIBOR. The\ntransition from LIBOR to an alternative\nreference rate has changed our market risk\nprofile and required changes to risk and\npricing models, valuation tools, product\ndesign, information technology systems,\nreporting infrastructure, operational\nprocesses and controls, and hedging\nstrategies, and may result in or require\nfurther such changes in the future. In many\ncases, we are and may in the future be\ndependent on third parties to upgrade systems,\nsoftware and other critical functions that\ncould materially disrupt our readiness if they\nare not done on a timely basis or otherwise\nfail. While we have largely remediated the\nmajority of our exposures, our effort to\nremediate the remaining exposures remains\nongoing. Failure to adequately manage the\ntransition could have a material adverse\neffect on our reputation, business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. See \u201cPart\nII\u2014Item 7. MD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d for\nadditional information.\n\nOur business could be negatively affected if\nwe are unable to attract, retain and motivate\nkey senior leaders and skilled employees.\n\nOur success depends, in large part, on our\nability to retain key senior leaders and to\nattract and retain skilled employees,\nparticularly employees with advanced expertise\nin credit, risk, digital and technology\nskills. We depend on our senior leaders and\nskilled employees to oversee simultaneous,\ntransformative initiatives across the\nenterprise and execute on our business plans\nin an efficient and effective manner.\nCompetition for such senior leaders and\nemployees, and the costs associated with\nattracting and retaining them, is high and\ncompetitive. While we engage in robust\nsuccession planning, our key senior leaders\nhave deep and broad industry experience and\ncould be difficult to replace without some\ndegree of disruption.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees also is affected by perceptions of\nour culture and management, including our\nposition on remote and hybrid work\narrangements, our profile in the regions where\nwe have offices and the professional\nopportunities we offer. Regulation or\nregulatory guidance restricting executive\ncompensation, as well as evolving investor\nexpectations, may limit the types of\ncompensation arrangements that we may enter\ninto with our most senior leaders and could\nhave a negative impact on our ability to\nattract, retain and motivate such leaders in\nsupport of our long-term strategy. These laws\nand regulations may not apply in the same\nmanner to all financial institutions and\ntechnology companies, which therefore may\nsubject us to more restrictions than other\ninstitutions and companies with which we\ncompete for talent and may also hinder our\nability to compete for talent with other\nindustries. We rely upon our senior leaders\nnot only for business success, but also to\nlead with integrity. To the extent our senior\nleaders behave in a manner that does not\ncomport with our values, the consequences to\nour brand and reputation could be severe and\ncould adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations. If we are unable to\nattract, develop and retain talented senior\nleadership and employees, or to implement\nappropriate succession plans for our senior\nleadership, our business could be negatively\naffected.\n                                              \n  We face risks from catastrophic events.     \n                                              \nDespite the business contingency plans we have\nin place, such plans do not fully mitigate all\npotential business continuity risks to us.\nGeopolitical events, natural disasters and\nother catastrophic events could harm our\nemployees, business and infrastructure,\nincluding our information technology systems\nand third-party platforms. Our ability to\nconduct business may be adversely affected by\na disruption in the infrastructure that\nsupports our business and the communities\nwhere we are located, which are concentrated\nin the Northern Virginia and New York\nmetropolitan areas, as well as Richmond,\nVirginia and Plano, Texas. This may include a\ndisruption involving damage or loss of access\nto a physical site, cyber-attacks and other\nsecurity incidents, terrorist activities, the\noccurrence or worsening of disease outbreaks\nor pandemics (including the COVID-19\npandemic), natural disasters, extreme weather\nevents, electrical outage, environmental\nhazards, disruption to technological\ninfrastructure, communications or other\nservices we use, our employees or third\nparties with whom we conduct business. Our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations may be impacted by any such\ndisruption and our ability to implement\ncorresponding response measures quickly. In\naddition, if a natural disaster or other\ncatastrophic event occurs in certain regions\n                                              \n  38    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nwhere our business and customers are\nconcentrated, such as the mid-Atlantic, New\nYork, California or Texas metropolitan areas,\nor in regions where our third-party platforms\nare located, we could be disproportionately\nimpacted as compared to our competitors. The\nimpact of such events and other catastrophes\non the overall economy and our physical and\ntransition risks may also adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nClimate change manifesting as physical or\ntransition risks could adversely affect our\nbusinesses, operations and customers.\n\nClimate change risks can manifest as physical\nor transition risks.\n\nPhysical risks are the risks from the effects\nof climate change arising from acute, climate-\nrelated events, such as, hurricanes and\nwildfires, and chronic shifts in climate, such\nas sea level rise and higher average\ntemperatures. Such events could lead to\nfinancial losses or disrupt our operations or\nthose of our customers or third parties on\nwhich we rely, including through direct damage\nto assets and indirect impacts from supply\nchain disruption and market volatility.\n\nTransition risks are the risks resulting from\nthe shift toward a lower-carbon economy\narising from the changes in policy, consumer\nand business sentiment or technologies in\nregards to limiting climate change. Transition\nrisks, including changes in consumer\npreferences and additional regulatory\nrequirements or taxes, could increase our\nexpenses, affect credit performance, and\nimpact our strategies or those of our\ncustomers. For more information on climate-\nrelated regulatory developments, see \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d\nfor additional information.\n\nPhysical and transition risks could also\naffect the financial health of certain\ncustomers in impacted industries or\ngeographies. In addition, we face reputational\nrisk as a result of our policies, practices,\ndisclosures and decisions related to climate\nchange and the environment, or the practices\nor involvement of our clients or vendors and\nsuppliers, in certain industries or projects\nassociated with causing or exacerbating\nclimate change.\n\nAs climate risk is interconnected with many\nrisk types, we continue to enhance processes\nto embed evolving climate risk considerations\ninto our existing risk management strategies;\nhowever, because the timing and severity of\nclimate change may not be predictable, our\nrisk management strategies may not be\neffective in mitigating climate risk exposure.\n\nWe face risks from the use of or changes to\nassumptions or estimates in our financial\nstatements.\n\nPursuant to generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we are\nrequired to use certain assumptions and\nestimates in preparing our financial\nstatements, including determining our\nallowance for credit losses, the fair value of\ncertain assets and liabilities, and goodwill\nimpairment, among other items. In addition,\nthe FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies\nmay change the financial accounting and\nreporting standards, including those related\nto assumptions and estimates we use to prepare\nour financial statements, in ways that we\ncannot predict and that could impact our\nfinancial statements. If actual results differ\nfrom the assumptions or estimates underlying\nour financial statements or if financial\naccounting and reporting standards are\nchanged, we may experience unexpected material\nlosses. For a discussion of our use of\nestimates in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements, see \u201cPart\nII\u2014Item 7.

Financial\nservices institutions are interrelated as a\nresult of trading, clearing, servicing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. We have\nexposure to financial institutions,\nintermediaries and counterparties that are\nexposed to risks over which we have little or\nno control.\n\nIn addition, we routinely execute transactions\nwith counterparties in the financial services\nindustry, including brokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds and other institutional clients,\nresulting in a significant credit\nconcentration with respect to the financial\nservices industry overall. As a result,\ndefaults by, or even rumors or questions\nabout, one or more financial services\ninstitutions, or the financial services\nindustry generally, have led to market-wide\nliquidity problems and could lead to losses or\ndefaults by us or by other institutions.\n\nLikewise, adverse developments affecting the\noverall strength and soundness of our\ncompetitors, the financial services industry\nas a whole and the general economic climate\nand the U.S. Treasury market could have a\nnegative impact on perceptions about the\nstrength and soundness of our business even if\nwe are not subject to the same adverse\ndevelopments.

We consider these metrics to be key\nfinancial measures that management uses in\nassessing our operating performance, capital\nadequacy and the level of returns generated.\nWe believe these non-GAAP metrics provide\nuseful insight to investors and users of our\nfinancial information as they provide an\nalternate measurement of our performance and\nassist in assessing our capital adequacy and\nthe level of return generated. These non-GAAP\nmeasures should not be viewed as a substitute\nfor reported results determined in accordance\nwith GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable\nto non-GAAP measures that may be presented by\nother companies.\n                                              \n   Three-Year Summary of Selected Financial   \n   Data                                       \n

Deferred\ntax assets are recognized subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment that these future\ndeductions are more likely than not to be\nrealized. We evaluate the recoverability of\nthese future tax deductions by assessing the\nadequacy of expected taxable income from all\nsources, including taxable income in carryback\nyears, reversal of taxable temporary\ndifferences, forecasted operating earnings and\navailable tax planning strategies. These\nsources of income rely heavily on estimates.\nWe use our historical experience and our short\nand long-range business forecasts to make\nthese estimates.\n\nDeferred tax assets, net of deferred tax\nliabilities and valuation allowances, were\napproximately $7.7 billion as of December 31,\n2022, an increase of $4.0 billion from\nDecember 31, 2021. The increase in our net\ndeferred tax assets was primarily driven by\nthe decrease in fair value of our available\nfor sale securities and derivatives, as well\nas the increase in allowance for credit losses\nin 2022.\n\nWe recorded valuation allowances of $446\nmillion and $355 million as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. If changes in\ncircumstances lead us to change our judgment\nabout our ability to realize deferred tax\nassets in future years, we will adjust our\nvaluation allowances in the period that our\nchange in judgment occurs and record a\ncorresponding increase or charge to income.\n\nWe provide additional information on income\ntaxes in \u201cConsolidated Results of Operations\u201d\nand \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management and\noversight of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, are centralized in our Corporate\nTreasury group. Our residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments is included in the\nOther category.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenue and expenses directly or\nindirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process is managed by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and provides a funds\ncredit for sources of funds, such as deposits\ngenerated by our Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking businesses, and a charge\nfor the use of funds by each segment. The\nallocation is unique to each business segment\nand acquired business and is based on the\ncomposition of assets and liabilities. The\nfunds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and\noff-balance sheet products. Periodically, the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the\nfunds transfer pricing process are adjusted to\nreflect economic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the business segments. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.\n\nWe refer to the business segment results\nderived from our internal management\naccounting and reporting process as our\n\u201cmanaged\u201d presentation, which differs in some\ncases from our reported results prepared based\non U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore,\nthe managed presentation of our business\nsegment results may not be comparable to\nsimilar information provided by other\nfinancial services companies. In addition, our\nindividual business segment results should not\nbe used as a substitute for comparable results\ndetermined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nWe summarize our business segment results for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020 and provide a comparative discussion of\nthese results for 2022 and 2021, as well as\nchanges in our financial condition and credit\nperformance metrics as of December 31, 2022\ncompared to December 31, 2021.

We also reserve\nfor the uncollectible portion of finance\ncharges and fees related to credit card loan\nreceivables in the allowance for credit losses\nconsistent with the methodology we use to\nestimate the allowance for credit losses on\nthe principal portion of our credit card loan\nreceivables. We also separately reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. We build our\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses, which is driven\nby charge-offs, changes in the allowance for\ncredit losses and changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments. The allowance\nfor credit losses was $13.2 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022, compared to $11.4 billion\nas of December 31, 2021.\n\nOur allowance for credit losses and reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments utilize\nmodels to derive a quantitative estimate of\ncredit losses that is supplemented with\nadditional qualitative considerations to\ncapture risks and uncertainties not included\nin the quantitative result. Our estimate of\nexpected credit losses, for all loan and\nunfunded lending commitments, includes a\nreasonable and supportable forecast period of\none year and then reverts over a one-year\nperiod to historical losses at each relevant\nloss component of the estimate. We use\nexternally produced consensus estimates as\ninputs for our forward-looking macroeconomic\nforecast and consider other forecasts and\nsources of uncertainty to develop the\nquantitative component. This quantitative\nresult is then supplemented qualitatively by\nmanagement for economic uncertainty, including\nthe consideration of alternative macroeconomic\nscenarios, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in the\nquantitative component. These adjustments\nrepresent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses.\n\nWe have an established process, using\nanalytical tools and management judgment, to\ndetermine our allowance for credit losses.\nSignificant management judgment is required to\ndetermine the relevant information and\nestimation methods used to arrive at our best\nestimate of lifetime credit losses.\nEstablishing the allowance on a quarterly\nbasis involves evaluating and forecasting both\ncredit and macroeconomic variables. The\nmacroeconomic forecast used to inform both\nquantitative and qualitative components of our\nallowance for credit losses estimate is\nsensitive to variables that may impact\nborrowers\u2019 ability to pay, such as the U.S.\nUnemployment Rate, and the U.S. Real Gross\nDomestic Product (\u201cU.S. Real GDP\u201d) Rate\nassumptions. Our December 31, 2022 allowance\nassumes that the average unemployment rate\ngradually increases to approximately 5.0% by\nthe fourth quarter of 2023 and annualized U.S.\nReal GDP decreases 0.3% in 2023.\n\nIn addition to macroeconomic factors, many\ncredit factors inform our allowance for credit\nlosses, including, but not limited to,\nhistorical loss and recovery experience,\nrecent trends in delinquencies and charge-\noffs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy\nfilings, the value of collateral underlying\nsecured loans, account seasoning, changes in\nour credit evaluation, underwriting and\ncollection management policies, seasonality,\ncredit bureau scores, current general economic\nconditions, changes in the legal and\nregulatory environment and uncertainties in\nforecasting and modeling techniques used in\nestimating our allowance for credit losses.\n\nWe have a governance framework supported by\nprocesses and controls intended to ensure that\nour estimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses is appropriate. Our governance\nframework provides for oversight of methods,\nmodels, qualitative adjustments, process\ncontrols and results. At least quarterly,\nrepresentatives from the Finance and Risk\nManagement organizations review and assess our\nallowance methodologies, key assumptions and\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for\ncredit losses. Groups independent of our\nestimation functions participate in the review\nand validation process. Tasks performed by\nthese groups include periodic review of the\nrationale for and quantification of inputs\nrequiring judgment as well as adjustments to\nresults.\n\nWe have a model policy, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which governs\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for estimating\ncredit losses. The Model Risk Office validates\nall models and requires ongoing monitoring of\ntheir performance.\n\nIn addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses, on a quarterly basis, we review and\nassess our estimate of expected losses related\nto unfunded lending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable which are\ngenerally in our Commercial Banking business.\nThe factors impacting our assessment generally\nalign with those considered in our evaluation\nof the allowance for credit losses for the\nCommercial Banking business. The reserve for\nlosses on unfunded lending commitments is\nincluded in other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and changes to it\nare recorded through the provision for credit\nlosses in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n                                              \n  66    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAlthough we examine a variety of externally\navailable data, as well as our internal loan\nperformance data, to determine our allowance\nfor credit losses and reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimation process is\nsubject to risks and uncertainties, including\na reliance on historical loss and trend\ninformation that may not be representative of\ncurrent conditions and indicative of future\nperformance as well as economic forecasts that\nmay not align with actual future economic\nconditions. Accordingly, our actual credit\nloss experience may not be in line with our\nexpectations.

We did not\nrecognize any goodwill impairment in 2022 or\n2021. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8. Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note\n6\u2014Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d for\nadditional information.\nWe perform our goodwill impairment test\nannually on October 1 at a reporting unit\nlevel. We are also required to test goodwill\nfor impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-\nnot that an impairment may have occurred. An\nimpairment of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is\ndetermined based on the amount by which the\nreporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its\nfair value, limited to the amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit. We have four\nreporting units: Credit Card, Auto Finance,\nOther Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.\n\nFor the purpose of our goodwill impairment\ntesting, we calculate the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit using an allocated capital\napproach based on each reporting unit\u2019s\nspecific regulatory capital requirements,\neconomic capital requirements and underlying\nrisks. The carrying amount for a reporting\nunit is the sum of its respective capital\nrequirements, goodwill and other intangibles\nbalances. Known future capital needs, such as\ndividends, share buybacks or other strategic\ninitiatives, are assumed distributed to equity\nholders in future periods and are not\nallocated to the reporting units or the Other\ncategory.\n\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit\nis a subjective process that requires the use\nof estimates and the exercise of significant\njudgment. We calculate the fair value of our\nreporting units using a discounted cash flow\n(\u201cDCF\u201d) calculation, a form of the income\napproach. This DCF calculation uses projected\ncash flows based on each reporting unit\u2019s\ninternal forecast and the perpetuity growth\nmethod to calculate terminal values. Our DCF\ncalculation requires management to make\nestimates about future loan, deposit and\nrevenue growth, as well as credit losses and\ncapital rates. These cash flows and terminal\nvalues are then discounted using discount\nrates based on our external cost of capital\nwith adjustments for the risk inherent in each\nreporting unit . Discount rates used for our\nreporting units ranged from 8.4% to 12.2%, and\nwe applied a terminal year long-term growth\nrate of 3.7% to all reporting units. The\nreasonableness of our DCF calculation is a\nssessed by reference to a market-based\napproach using comparable market multiples and\nrecent market transactions where available.\nThe results of the 2022 annual impairment test\nfor the reporting units indicated that the\nestimated fair values of the Commercial\nBanking, Credit Card, Auto Finance, and Other\nConsumer Banking reporting units exceeded\ntheir carrying amounts by between 17% and 72%.\n\nAssumptions used in estimating the fair value\nof a reporting unit are judgmental and\ninherently uncertain. A change in the economic\nconditions of a reporting unit, such as\ndeclines in business performance as a result\nof industry or macroeconomic trends or changes\nin our strategy, adverse impacts to loan or\ndeposit growth trends, decreases in revenue,\nincreases in expenses, increases in credit\nlosses, increases in capital requirements,\ndeterioration of market conditions, declines\nin long-term growth expectations, adverse\nimpacts of regulatory or legislative changes\nor increases in the estimated cost of capital,\nincluding if these conditions are merely\nforecasted to occur in future periods, could\ncause the estimated fair values of our\nreporting units to decline in the future, and\nincrease the risk of a goodwill impairment in\na future period.\n\nWe have a governance framework supported by\nprocesses and controls intended to ensure that\nthe accounting and disclosure for goodwill is\nappropriate. Our governance framework provides\nfor oversight of assumptions, forecast inputs,\nmethods, process controls and results.\n                                              \n  67    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Fair Value                                  \n                                              \nFair value, also referred to as an exit price,\nis defined as the price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n\nLevel 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices\n(unadjusted) in active markets for identical\nassets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Valuation is based on observable\nmarket-based inputs other than Level 1 prices,\nsuch as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active, or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially the\nfull term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3: Valuation is generated from\ntechniques that use significant assumptions\nnot observable in the market. Valuation\ntechniques include pricing models, discounted\ncash flow methodologies or similar techniques.\n\nThe degree of management judgment involved in\ndetermining the fair value of a financial\ninstrument is dependent upon the availability\nof quoted prices in active markets or\nobservable market parameters. When quoted\nprices and observable data in active markets\nare not fully available, management judgment\nis necessary to estimate fair value. Changes\nin market conditions, such as reduced\nliquidity in the capital markets or changes in\nsecondary market activities, may reduce the\navailability and reliability of quoted prices\nor observable data used to determine fair\nvalue.\n\nWe have developed policies and procedures to\ndetermine when markets for our financial\nassets and liabilities are inactive if the\nlevel and volume of activity has declined\nsignificantly relative to normal conditions.\nIf markets are determined to be inactive, it\nmay be appropriate to adjust price quotes\nreceived. When significant adjustments are\nrequired to price quotes or inputs, it may be\nappropriate to utilize an estimate based\nprimarily on unobservable inputs.\n\nSignificant judgment may be required to\ndetermine whether certain financial\ninstruments measured at fair value are\nclassified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making\nthis determination, we consider all available\ninformation that market participants use to\nmeasure the fair value of the financial\ninstrument, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused. Based upon the specific facts and\ncircumstances of each instrument or instrument\ncategory, judgments are made regarding the\nsignificance of the Level 3 inputs to the\ninstruments\u2019 fair value measurement in its\nentirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. We\ndiscuss changes in the valuation inputs and\nassumptions used in determining the fair value\nof our financial instruments, including the\nextent to which we have relied on significant\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value and\nour process for corroborating these inputs, in\n\u201cPart II\u2014Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\u2014Note 16\u2014Fair Value\nMeasurement.\u201d\n\nWe have a governance framework and a number of\nkey controls that are intended to ensure that\nour fair value measurements are appropriate\nand reliable. Our governance framework\nprovides for independent oversight and\nsegregation of duties. Our control processes\ninclude review and approval of new transaction\ntypes, price verification, and review of\nvaluation judgments, methods, models, process\ncontrols and results.\n\nGroups independent of our trading and\ninvesting functions participate in the review\nand validation process. Tasks performed by\nthese groups include periodic verification of\nfair value measurements to determine if\nassigned fair values are reasonable, including\ncomparing prices from vendor pricing services\nto other available market information.\n\nOur Fair Value Committee (\u201cFVC\u201d), which\nincludes representation from business areas,\nRisk Management and Finance, provides guidance\nand oversight to ensure an appropriate\nvaluation control environment. The FVC\nregularly reviews and approves our fair\nvaluations to ensure that our valuation\npractices are consistent with industry\nstandards and adhere to regulatory and\naccounting guidance.\n                                              \n  68    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe have a model policy, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which governs\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for pricing and fair\nvalue measurements. The Model Risk Office\nvalidates all models and requires ongoing\nmonitoring of their performance.\n\nThe fair value governance process is set up in\na manner that allows the Chairperson of the\nFVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot\nbe resolved by the FVC to a more senior\ncommittee called the Valuations Advisory\nCommittee (\u201cVAC\u201d) for resolution. The VAC is\nchaired by the Chief Financial Officer and\nincludes other members of senior manageme nt.\n. There were no disputes escalated to the VAC\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021.\n                                              \n  Customer Rewards Reserve                    \n                                              \nWe offer products, primarily credit cards,\nwhich include programs that allow members to\nearn rewards based on account activity that\ncan be redeemed for cash (primarily in the\nform of statement credits), gift cards,\ntravel, or covering eligible charges. The\namount of rewards that a customer earns varies\nbased on the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program and product. The majority of\nour rewards do not expire and there is no\nlimit on the amount of rewards an eligible\ncard member can earn. Customer rewards costs,\nwhich we generally record as an offset to\ninterchange income, are driven by various\nfactors such as card member purchase volume,\nthe terms and conditions of the rewards\nprogram and rewards redemption cost. We\nestablish a customer rewards reserve that\nreflects management\u2019s judgment regarding\nrewards earned that are expected to be\nredeemed and the estimated redemption cost.\n\nWe use financial models to estimate ultimate\nredemption rates of rewards earned to date by\ncurrent card members based on historical\nredemption trends, current enrollee redemption\nbehavior, card product type, year of program\nenrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend\nlevels. Our current assumption is that the\nvast majority of all rewards earned will\neventually be redeemed. We use the weighted-\naverage redemption cost during the previous\ntwelve months, adjusted as appropriate for\nrecent changes in redemption costs, including\nchanges related to the mix of rewards\nredeemed, to estimate future redemption costs.\nWe continually evaluate our reserve and\nassumptions based on developments in\nredemption patterns, changes to the terms and\nconditions of the rewards program and other\nfactors. While the rewards liability is\nsensitive to changes in assumptions for\nredemption rates and costs and involves\nmanagement judgment, we believe portfolio\ncharacteristics and historical performance are\nthe best indication of future reward\nredemption behavior and are the primary basis\nfor our estimate. We recognized customer\nrewards expense of $7.6 billion, $6.4 billion\nand $4.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. Our customer rewards reserve,\nwhich is included in other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets, totaled $6.8\nbillion and $6.2 billion as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nWe have a governance framework supported by\nprocesses and controls that are intended to\nensure that our rewards liability estimate is\nappropriate and reliable. Our governance\nframework provides for oversight of\nassumptions, inputs, methods, process controls\nand results. Additional controls are performed\nto ensure all underlying data used to derive\nthe rewards liability is complete and\naccurate.\n                                       \n  ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS  \n                                       \nAccounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as\nof December 31, 2022\n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                 The                          \n                 amendments                   \n                 in this                      \n                 update                       \n                 eliminate                    \n                 the                          \n                 accounting                   \n                 guidance                     \n                 for            This ASU      \n                 Troubled       became        \n                 Debt           effective     \n                 Restructur\u2026    for us on     \n  TDR and        while          January 1,    \n  Vintage        enhancing      2023.         \n  Disclosures    disclosure     We adopted    \n  ASU No.        requiremen\u2026    this          \n  2022-02,       for certain    guidance in   \n  Financial      loan           the first     \n  Instruments    refinancin\u2026    quarter of    \n  - Credit       and            2023 using    \n  Losses         restructur\u2026    the modified  \n  (Topic         for            retrospecti\u2026  \n  326):Troub\u2026    borrowers      method.       \n  Debt           experienci\u2026    Adoption of   \n  Restructur\u2026    financial      this          \n  and Vintage    difficulty.    standard did  \n  Disclosures    The            not have a    \n  Issued         amendments     material      \n  March 2022     also           impact on     \n                 require        our           \n                 public         consolidated  \n                 entities to    financial     \n                 disclose       statements.   \n                 current-pe\u2026                  \n                 gross                        \n                 charge offs                  \n                 by year of                   \n                 origination                  \n                 for loans                    \n                 held for                     \n                 investment.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n  69    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                      \n  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  \n                      \nThe level and composition of our capital are\ndetermined by multiple factors, including our\nconsolidated regulatory capital requirements\nas described in more detail below and internal\nrisk-based capital assessments such as\ninternal stress testing.

Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Banking\nAgencies set an earlier effective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is recalibrated every year based\non the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults. In particular, the Company\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement equals, subject to\na floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference\nbetween the Company\u2019s starting CET1 capital\nratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital\nratio under the severely adverse scenario of\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test\nplus (ii) the ratio of the Company\u2019s projected\nfour quarters of common stock dividends (for\nthe fourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the Company\u2019s\nprojected CET1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2021 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 was\n2.5%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework were 7.0%,\n8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2022 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 is\n3.1%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe\n                                              \n  70    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nstress capital buffer framework are 7.6%, 9.1%\nand 11.1%, respectively, for the period from\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 .\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Bank. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, the Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%\nrespectively.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain\nits capital ratios above the minimum capital\nrequirements plus the applicable capital\nconservation buffer requirements, it will face\nincreasingly strict automatic limitations on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, the Company and the Bank each\nexceeded the minimum capital requirements and\nthe capital conservation buffer requirements\napplicable to them, and the Company and the\nBank were each \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d The \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d standards applicable to the\nCompany are established in the Federal\nReserve\u2019s regulations, and the \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d standards applicable to the Bank\nare established in the OCC\u2019s PCA capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading book. The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\nand CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule.\nSee \u201cMarket Risk Profile\u201d below for additional\ninformation.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted the CECL\nTransition Rule that provides banking\ninstitutions an optional five-year transition\nperiod to phase in the impact of the CECL\nstandard on their regulatory capital, the CECL\nTransition Election. We adopted the CECL\nstandard (for accounting purposes) as of\nJanuary 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition\nElection (for regulatory capital purposes) in\nthe first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the\napplicable amounts presented in this Report\nreflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

Our Board of Directors,\nChief Executive Officer and management\nestablish the tone at the top regarding the\nculture of the Company, including management\nof risk. Management reinforces expectations at\nthe various levels of the organization.\n                                              \n  Strategy and Risk Alignment                 \n                                              \nOur strategy is informed by and aligned with\nrisk appetite, from development to execution.\nThe Chief Executive Officer develops the\nstrategy with input from the first, second,\nand third lines of defense, as well as the\nBoard of Directors. The strategic planning\nprocess considers relevant changes to the\nCompany\u2019s overall risk profile.\n\nOur Board of Directors approves a Risk\nAppetite Statement for the Company to set\nforth the high-level principles that govern\nrisk taking at the Company. The Risk Appetite\nStatement defines the Board of Directors\u2019\ntolerance for certain risk outcomes at an\nenterprise level and enables senior management\nto manage and report within these boundaries.\nThis Risk Appetite Statement is also supported\nby risk category specific risk appetite\nstatements as well as metrics and, where\nappropriate, Board Limits and Board\nNotification Thresholds.\n                                              \n  Risk Identification                         \n                                              \nThe first line of defense and certain Support\nFunctions identify new and emerging risks,\nincluding concentration of risk, across the\nrelevant risk categories associated with their\nbusiness activities and objectives, in\nconsultation with IRM. Risk identification\nalso must be informed by major changes in\ninfrastructure or organization, introduction\nof new products and services, acquisitions of\nbusinesses, or substantial changes in the\ninternal or external environment.\n\nIRM and certain Support Functions, where\nappropriate, provide effective challenge in\nthe risk identification process. IRM is also\nresponsible for identifying our material\naggregate risks on an ongoing basis.\n                                              \n  76    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Assessment, Measurement and Response        \n                                              \nManagement assesses risks associated with our\nactivities. Risks identified are assessed to\nunderstand the severity of each risk and\nlikelihood of occurrence under both normal and\nstressful conditions. Risk severity is\nmeasured through modeling and other\nquantitative estimation approaches, as well as\nqualitative approaches, based on management\njudgment. As part of the risk assessment\nprocess, the first and second lines of defense\nalso evaluate the effectiveness of the\nexisting control environment and mitigation\nstrategies.\n\nManagement determines the appropriate risk\nresponse. Risks may be mitigated or accepted.\nActions taken to respond to the risk include\nimplementing new controls, enhancing existing\ncontrols, developing additional mitigation\nstrategies to reduce the impact of the risk,\nand/or monitoring the risk.\n                                              \n  Monitoring and Testing                      \n                                              \nManagement periodically monitors risks to\nevaluate and measure how the risk is affecting\nour strategy and business objectives, in\nalignment with risk appetite, including\nestablished concentration risk limits. The\nscope and frequency of monitoring activities\ndepends on the results of relevant risk\nassessments, as well as specific business risk\noperations and activities.\n\nThe first line of defense is required to\nevaluate the effectiveness of risk management\npractices and controls through testing and\nother activities. IRM and Support Functions,\nas appropriate, assess the first line of\ndefense\u2019s evaluation of risk management, which\nmay include conducting effective challenge,\nperforming independent monitoring, or\nconducting risk or control validations. The\nthird line of defense provides independent\nassurance for first and second line risk\nmanagement practices and controls.\n                                              \n  Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation       \n                                              \nRisk aggregation supports strategic decision\nmaking and risk management practices through\ncollectively reporting risks across different\nlevels of the Company and providing a\ncomprehensive view of performance against risk\nappetite. Capital One\u2019s risk aggregation\nprocesses are designed to aggregate risk\ninformation from lower levels of the business\nhierarchy to high levels and to aggregate risk\ninformation to determine material risk themes.\n\nMaterial risks, new or emerging risks,\naggregate risks, risk appetite metrics and\nother measures across all risk categories are\nreported to the appropriate governance forum\nno less than quarterly. Material risks are\nreported to the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement committees no less than quarterly.\n                                              \n   Capital and Liquidity Management           \n   (including Stress Testing)                 \n                                              \nOur capital management processes are linked to\nits risk management practices, including the\nenterprise-wide identification, assessment and\nmeasurement of risks to ensure that all\nrelevant risks are incorporated in the\nassessment of the Company's capital adequacy.\nWe use identified risks to inform key aspects\nof the Company\u2019s capital planning, including\nthe development of stress scenarios, the\nassessment of the adequacy of post-stress\ncapital levels, and the appropriateness of\npotential capital actions considering the\nCompany\u2019s capital objectives. We quantify\ncapital needs through stress testing,\nregulatory capital, economic capital and\nassessments of market considerations. In\nassessing its capital adequacy, we identify\nhow and where our material risks are accounted\nfor within the capital planning process.\nMonitoring and escalation processes exist for\nkey capital thresholds and metrics to\ncontinuously monitor capital adequacy.\n\nWe manage liquidity risk by applying our\nLiquidity Adequacy Framework (the \u201cLiquidity\nFramework\u201d). The Liquidity Framework uses\ninternal and regulatory stress testing and the\nevaluation of other balance sheet metrics to\nconfirm that we maintain a fortified balance\nsheet that is resilient to uncertainties that\nmay arise as a consequence of systemic,\nidiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events.\n                                              \n  Risk Data and Enabling Technology           \n                                              \nRisk data and technology provides the basis\nfor risk reporting and is used in decision\nmaking and to monitor and review changes to\nour risk profile. There is a core Governance,\nRisk Management and Compliance system which is\nused as the system of record for risks,\ncontrols, issues and events for our risk\ncategories and supports the analysis,\naggregation and reporting capabilities across\nthe categories.\n                                              \n  77    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)

Consequently, we\ntry to ensure our credit portfolio is\nresilient to economic downturns. Our most\nimportant tool in this endeavor is sound\nunderwriting. In unsecured consumer loan\nunderwriting, we generally assume that loans\nwill be subject to an environment in which\nlosses are higher than those prevailing at the\ntime of underwriting. In commercial\nunderwriting, we generally require strong cash\nflow, collateral, covenants, and guarantees.\nIn addition to sound underwriting, we\ncontinually monitor our portfolio and take\nsteps to collect or work out distressed loans.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with\nthe Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit\nOfficers, is responsible for establishing\ncredit risk policies and procedures, including\nunderwriting and hold guidelines and credit\napproval authority, and monitoring credit\nexposure and performance of our lending\nrelated transactions. Our Consumer and\nCommercial Chief Credit Officers are\nresponsible for evaluating the risk\nimplications of credit strategy and the\noversight of credit for both the existing\nportfolio and any new credit investments. They\nalso have formal approval authority for\nvarious types and levels of credit decisions,\nincluding individual commercial loan\ntransactions. Division Presidents within each\nsegment are responsible for managing the\ncredit risk within their divisions and\nmaintaining processes to control credit risk\nand comply with credit policies and\nguidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk\nOfficer establishes policies, delegates\napproval authority and monitors performance\nfor non-loan credit exposure entered into with\nfinancial counterparties or through the\npurchase of credit sensitive securities in our\ninvestment portfolio.\n\nOur credit policies establish standards in\nfive areas: customer selection, underwriting,\nmonitoring, remediation and portfolio\nmanagement. The standards in each area provide\na framework comprising specific objectives and\ncontrol processes. These standards are\nsupported by detailed policies and procedures\nfor each component of the credit process.\nStarting with customer selection, our goal is\nto generally provide credit on terms that\ngenerate above hurdle returns. We use a number\nof quantitative and qualitative factors to\nmanage credit risk, including setting credit\nrisk limits and guidelines for each of our\nlines of business.

The Liquidity Framework uses\ninternal and regulatory stress testing and the\nevaluation of other balance sheet metrics to\nconfirm that we maintain a fortified balance\nsheet that is resilient to uncertainties that\nmay arise as a consequence of systemic,\nidiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events.\nWe continuously monitor market and economic\nconditions to evaluate emerging stress\nconditions and to develop appropriate action\nplans in accordance with our Contingency\nFunding Plan and our Recovery Plan, which\ninclude the Company\u2019s policies, procedures and\naction plans for managing liquidity stress\nevents. The Liquidity Framework enables us to\nmanage our liquidity risk in accordance with\nregulatory requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the Liquidity Framework\nestablishes governing principles that apply to\nthe management of liquidity risk. We use these\nprinciples to monitor, measure and report\nliquidity risk; to develop funding and\ninvestment strategies that enable us to\nmaintain an adequate level of liquidity to\nsupport our businesses and satisfy regulatory\nrequirements; and to protect us from a broad\nrange of liquidity events should they arise.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with\nthe Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer,\nis responsible for the establishment of\nliquidity risk management policies and\nstandards for governance and monitoring of\nliquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess\nliquidity strength by evaluating several\ndifferent balance sheet metrics under severe\nstress scenarios to ensure we can withstand\nsignificant funding degradation through\nidiosyncratic, systemic and combined liquidity\nstress scenarios. Management reports liquidity\nmetrics to appropriate senior management\ncommittees and to our Board of Directors no\nless than quarterly.\n\nWe seek to mitigate liquidity risk\nstrategically and tactically. From a strategic\nperspective, we have acquired and built\ndeposit gathering businesses and actively\nmonitor our funding concentration. From a\ntactical perspective, we have accumulated a\nsizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash\nand cash equivalents, high-quality,\nunencumbered securities and committed\n                                              \n  79    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ncollateralized credit lines.

Market risk\nis inherent from the financial instruments\nassociated with our business operations and\nactivities including loans, deposits,\nsecurities, short-term borrowings, long-term\ndebt and derivatives. We manage market risk\nexposure, which is principally driven by\nbalance sheet interest rate risk, centrally\nand establish quantitative risk limits to\nmonitor and control our exposure.\n\nWe recognize that interest rate and foreign\nexchange risk is present in our business due\nto the nature of our assets and liabilities.\nIn addition to using industry accepted\ntechniques to analyze and measure interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk, we perform\nsensitivity analysis to identify our risk\nexposures under a broad range of scenarios.\nInvestment securities and derivatives are the\nmain levers for the management of interest\nrate risk. In addition, we also use\nderivatives to manage our foreign exchange\nrisk.\n\nThe market risk positions for the Company and\nthe Bank are calculated separately and in\naggregate, and analyzed against pre-\nestablished limits.

Our credit cards generally have\nvariable interest rates. Credit card accounts\nare primarily underwritten using an automated\nunderwriting system based on predictive models\nthat we have developed. The underwriting\ncriteria, which are customized for individual\nproducts and marketing programs, are\nestablished based on an analysis of the net\npresent value of expected revenues, expenses\nand losses, subject to further analysis using\na variety of stress conditions. Underwriting\ndecisions are generally based on credit bureau\ninformation, including payment history, debt\nburden and credit scores, such as FICO scores,\nand on other factors, such as applicant\nincome. We maintain a credit card\nsecuritization program and selectively sell\ncharged-off credit card loans.\n\n\u2022 Auto: We originate both prime and subprime\nauto loans through a network of auto dealers\nand direct marketing. Our auto loans generally\nhave fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75\nmonths or less, but can go up to 84 months.\nLoan size limits are customized by program and\nare generally less than $75,000. Similar to\ncredit card accounts, the underwriting\ncriteria are customized for individual\nproducts and marketing programs and based on\nanalysis of net present value of expected\nrevenues, expenses and losses, and are subject\nto maintaining resilience under a variety of\nstress conditions.

Where\nrelevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying\ncollateral and guarantees. We maintain\nunderwriting guidelines and limits for major\ntypes of borrowers and loan products that\nspecify, where applicable, guidelines for debt\nservice coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and\nstandard covenants and conditions. We assign a\nrisk rating and establish a monitoring\nschedule for loans based on the risk profile\nof the borrower, industry segment, source of\nrepayment, the underlying collateral and\nguarantees, if any, and current market\nconditions. Although we generally retain the\ncommercial loans we underwrite, we may\nsyndicate positions for risk mitigation\npurposes, including bridge financing\ntransactions we have underwritten.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n                                              \n  Table 21: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            December         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     31, 2022         31, 2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             69  %            71  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or              31               29     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n                                              \n  85    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            December         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     31, 2022         31, 2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             53  %            50  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660           20               20     \n  620 or              27               30     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

The effective\ninterest rate on the loan immediately prior to\nthe loan modification is used as the effective\ninterest rate for purposes of measuring\nimpairment using the present value of expected\ncash flows.\n                                              \n  89    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nIf the customer does not comply with the\nmodified payment terms, then the credit card\nloan agreement may revert to its original\npayment terms, generally resulting in any loan\noutstanding being reflected in the appropriate\ndelinquency category and charged off in\naccordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our loans modified as TDRs receive an\nextension, an interest rate reduction,\nprincipal reduction, or a combination of these\nmodifications. In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\namortized cost.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of loans modified as TDRs receive an\nextension, with a portion of these loans\nreceiving an interest rate reduction or a\ngross balance reduction. The impairment on\nmodified commercial loans is generally\ndetermined based on the underlying collateral\nvalue.\n\nAs part of our response to the COVID-19\npandemic, we offered programs to accommodate\ncustomer hardship across our lines of business\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2020. Our\nCOVID-19 programs were designed to be short-\nterm accommodations so that we could provide\nour customers with prompt relief. Also in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional\nguidance was issued by the Federal Banking\nAgencies and contained in the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES\nAct\u201d) which provided banking organizations\nwith TDR relief for loan modifications to\ncertain qualifying borrowers impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile the majority of enrollments in our\nCOVID-19 programs were short-term and would\ngenerally not have resulted in TDR\nclassification under our existing policies,\nsome of these modification would have been\ndesignated as TDRs without the relief provided\nby the additional guidance issued by the\nFederal Banking Agencies and contained in the\nCARES Act. Therefore, the expiry of the\nguidance in the CARES Act on January 1, 2022,\nalong with our concurrent cessation in\napplying the additional guidance issued by the\nFederal Banking Agencies, drove an increase in\nreported TDRs for periods ending after\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nTable 27 presents our amortized cost of loans\nmodified in TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, which excludes loan modifications that\ndo not meet the definition of a TDR.\n                                              \n  Table 27: Troubled Debt Restructurings      \n                                              \n                                              \n          De\u2026                  D\u2026             \n          31,                  3\u2026             \n          20\u2026                  2\u2026             \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026               %                    %      \n  \u2026       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of      \n  \u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026      \n                 M\u2026                  Mo\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  455    1\u2026    %    $  3\u2026    23\u2026  %   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       162        6.0       1\u2026    10\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       617        23\u2026       5\u2026    34\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026    4\u2026            6\u2026    36\u2026      \n  \u2026        16    0\u2026            13    0.8      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       1,\u2026    4\u2026            6\u2026    37\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       959    3\u2026            4\u2026    27\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  2,\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    10\u2026  %   \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  2,\u2026        78\u2026    $  1\u2026         7\u2026  \n  \u2026       576    2\u2026            3\u2026    21\u2026      \n  \u2026    $  2,\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    10\u2026  %   \n                                              \nWe provide additional information on modified\nloans accounted for as a TDR, including the\nperformance of those loans subsequent to\nmodification, in \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

We provide additional\ninformation below about our primary sources of\nmarket risk, our market risk management\nstrategies and the measures that we use to\nevaluate these exposures.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Risk                          \n                                              \nInterest rate risk represents exposure to\nfinancial instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest rates. We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or re-pricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments which could\ninclude caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact on our projected 12-month\nbaseline net interest income resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. In addition to\nour existing assets and liabilities, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions, such as loan and deposit growth\nand pricing, and plans for projected changes\nin our funding mix in our baseline forecast.\nIn measuring the sensitivity of interest rate\nmovements on our projected net interest\nincome, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous\nparallel shift in the level of interest rates\ndetailed in Table 35 below. At the current\nlevel of interest rates, our net interest\nincome is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease in lower rate\nscenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward\nshocks has decreased as compared to December\n31, 2021, mainly due to the increase in market\ninterest rates.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity        \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact on the net\npresent value of our assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivative exposures, resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Key\nassumptions used in the calculation include\nprojecting rate sensitive prepayments for\nmortgage securities, loans and other assets,\nterm structure modeling of interest rates,\ndiscount spreads, and deposit volume and\npricing assumptions. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\neconomic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n35 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity decreases in higher\ninterest rate scenarios and increases in most\nlower interest rate scenarios. Our current\neconomic value of equity sensitivity to upward\nshocks in higher rate scenarios became more\nnegative as compared to December 31, 2021,\nmainly due to the increase in long-term\ninterest rates.\n                                              \n  97    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 35 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand economic value of equity calculated under\nthe methodology described above as of December\n31, 2022 and 2021. In instances where an\ninterest rate scenario would result in a rate\nless than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that\nscenario. This assumption applies only to\njurisdictions that do not have negative policy\nrates. In jurisdictions that have negative\npolicy rates, we do not floor interest rates\nat 0%.\n                                              \n   Table 35: Interest Rate Sensitivity        \n   Analysis                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n               December        December       \n               31, 2022        31, 2021       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimat\u2026                                    \n  impact                                      \n  on                                          \n  project\u2026                                    \n  baseline                                    \n  net                                         \n  interest                                    \n  income:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis             0.4  %          3.4  %    \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis             0.8             2.5       \n  points                                      \n  +50                                         \n  basis             0.4             1.5       \n  points                                      \n  \u201350                                         \n  basis            -0.7            -1.8       \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis            -1.3                  N/A  \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis            -2.6                  N/A  \n  points                                      \n  Estimat\u2026                                    \n  impact                                      \n  on                                          \n  economic                                    \n  value of                                    \n  equity:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis            -4.3            -0.7       \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis            -1.5             1.9       \n  points                                      \n  +50                                         \n  basis            -0.7             1.4       \n  points                                      \n  \u201350                                         \n  basis             0.4            -2.6       \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis             0.6                  N/A  \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis            -0.2                  N/A  \n  points                                      \n                                              \nIn addition to these industry standard\nmeasures, we also consider the potential\nimpact of alternative interest rate scenarios,\nsuch as stressed rate shocks as well as\nsteepening and flattening yield curve\nscenarios in our internal interest rate risk\nmanagement decisions.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments. Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on our existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nnominal intercompany funding outstanding was\n785 million GBP and 520 million GBP as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and\n1.7 billion CAD and 5.0 billion CAD as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our\nnominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding\nwere 1.3 billion EUR and 1.2 billion EUR as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet to\ntranslation risk in AOCI and our capital\nratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 1.9 billion\nGBP and 1.8 billion GBP as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively and 2.2 billion\nCAD and 1.9 billion CAD as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal.

The continuation of USD LIBOR\nas a representative rate into mid-2023 will\nallow many legacy USD LIBOR contracts to\nmature prior to cessation. Following IBA\u2019s\nannouncement, the FCA formally announced the\nfuture permanent cessation and loss of\nrepresentativeness of LIBOR benchmarks. The\nFederal Banking Agencies issued further\nguidance that banking organizations should\ncease using USD LIBOR as a reference rate in\nnew contracts as soon as practicable and in\nany event by December 31, 2021. Consistent\nwith the Federal Banking Agencies\u2019 guidance,\nwe ceased entering into new contracts\nreferencing USD LIBOR as a reference rate as\nof January 1, 2022, subject to certain\npermissible exceptions.\n\nOn December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve\nBoard adopted the final rule that implemented\nthe LIBOR Act. The LIBOR Act identified\nbenchmark replacement rates based on SOFR for\ncovered derivative transactions and cash\ntransactions where a\n                                              \n  99    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\npracticable interest rate fallback method has\nnot been established by June 30, 2023,\nincluding those in which a government-\nsponsored enterprise is a party.\n\nOur LIBOR transition effort remains focused on\nproactively transitioning exposures to an\nalternative rate or incorporating transition\nlanguage (\u201cfallback language\u201d) to provide a\ncontractual mechanism for transitioning upon\nthe LIBOR cessation. Our fallback language\naligns with the language recommended by the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d)\nin our lending contracts and the International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association (\u201cISDA\u201d) in\nour derivative contracts and agreements to the\ngreatest extent possible.\n\nOur enterprise LIBOR transition program team,\nwhich has been working on this effort since\n2018 and includes senior management\nrepresentatives from across the enterprise,\nprovides monthly reporting to senior\nmanagement and quarterly reporting to our\nBoard of Directors. The information provided\nto senior management and the Board of\nDirectors includes exposure reporting, updates\non progress toward our goals to reduce our\nLIBOR exposure and relevant regulatory or\nindustry developments.\n\nWe continue to focus our LIBOR transition\nefforts on:\n\n\u2022 monitoring established controls to prevent\nthe origination of impermissible LIBOR indexed\ninstruments\n\n\u2022 working with impacted customers and\ncounterparties to remediate remaining LIBOR\ncontracts and our central counterparty\nclearinghouses and derivative clearinghouses\nfor conversion of centrally cleared USD LIBOR\nproducts\n\n\u2022 engaging with our clients, industry working\ngroups, and regulators\n\n\u2022 preparing to transition remaining contracts,\nincluding those with hardwired fallback\nlanguage, operable legacy fallback language\nand those covered under the scope of the LIBOR\nAct.\n\nThe majority of LIBOR contracts that we have\ntransitioned to alternative rates have\nemployed SOFR. In the U.S., SOFR has been\nselected as the preferred alternative rate by\nthe ARRC for certain U.S. dollar derivative\nand cash instruments. We have proactively\nworked with customers and prepared our\nsystems, models, valuation tools and processes\nto focus originations on SOFR and other non-\nLIBOR rates and will continue to do so as\nneeded. While the majority of our non-LIBOR\ntransactions have utilized SOFR, we have also\nemployed credit sensitive alternative rates to\nLIBOR, to a limited extent, in response to\ncustomer demand.\n\nTo track transition status, instruments are\ncategorized based on whether they have\nfallback language (which may or may not adhere\nto the ISDA and ARRC standards) or have no\nfallback language. The majority of the\ninstruments maturing after June 30, 2023 are\nderivatives and commercial loans, which are\nsummarized in the table below. Of these\ninstruments, the majority contain fallback\nlanguage which adheres to the ISDA and ARRC\nstandards. The LIBOR Act provides a means for\ntransitioning certain contracts that lack\nfallback language and which we are not able to\notherwise remediate prior to LIBOR cessation.\nWe will continue to focus on reducing our\nLIBOR exposures through our transition\nefforts, normal operations and customer\ninteractions.\nTable 36: LIBOR Exposures on Derivatives and\nCommercial Loans\n                                              \n                                       Total  \n                                       LIBOR  \n                                       Comm\u2026  \n                           Total       Matu\u2026  \n                           LIBOR       after  \n              Dece\u2026       Commi\u2026        June  \n  (Dol\u2026         31,       Matur\u2026         30,  \n  in           2022        after        2023  \n  mill\u2026       Total         June       With\u2026  \n  Expo\u2026       LIBOR          30,       Fall\u2026  \n  Type\u2026       Comm\u2026         2023       Lang\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Deri\u2026    $  38,2\u2026    $  34,606    $  7,211  \n  Comm\u2026       33,0\u2026       28,994         887  \n  loans                                       \n  Total    $  71,3\u2026    $  63,600    $  8,098  \n                                              \n                                              \n  100    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                       Total  \n                                       LIBOR  \n                                       Comm\u2026  \n                           Total       Matu\u2026  \n                           LIBOR       after  \n              Dece\u2026       Commi\u2026        June  \n  (Dol\u2026         31,       Matur\u2026         30,  \n  in           2021        after        2023  \n  mill\u2026       Total         June       With\u2026  \n  Expo\u2026       LIBOR          30,       Fall\u2026  \n  Type\u2026       Comm\u2026         2023       Lang\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Deri\u2026    $  103,\u2026    $  64,605    $  14,5\u2026  \n  Comm\u2026       101,\u2026       71,874       2,047  \n  loans                                       \n  Total    $  205,\u2026    $  136,4\u2026    $  16,5\u2026  \n                                              \n_________\n\n(1) Commercial loan balances represent maximum\npotential exposures and derivatives represent\nnotional exposure.\n\nThese transition efforts have been implemented\nto remediate our remaining LIBOR contracts by\nJune 30, 2023.

Internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process designed by,\nor under the supervision of, the Company\u2019s\nprincipal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, and effected by the Company\u2019s Board\nof Directors, management and other personnel,\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for\nexternal reporting purposes in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nCapital One\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that the Company\u2019s receipts\nand expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the\nCompany\u2019s management and directors; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the\nCompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on its financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nManagement conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022, based on the framework in\n\u201c2013 Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework\u201d\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\n(\u201cCOSO\u201d), commonly referred to as the \u201c2013\nFramework.\u201d\n\nBased on this assessment, management concluded\nthat, as of December 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting was\neffective based on the criteria established by\nCOSO in the 2013 Framework.

A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                        \n  /s/Ernst & Young LLP  \n  Tysons, Virginia      \n  February 24, 2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                        \n                                              \n  114    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC    \n   ACCOUNTING FIRM                            \n                                              \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors\nof Capital One Financial Corporation:\n                                              \n   Opinion on the Financial Statements        \n                                              \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of Capital One Financial\nCorporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, the related consolidated\nstatements of income, comprehensive income,\nchanges in stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2022, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated\nfinancial statements\u201d).

One Financial Corporation, a Delaware\nCorporation established in 1994 and\nheadquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) offer a broad\narray of financial products and services to\nconsumers, small businesses and commercial\nclients through digital channels, branches,\ncaf\u00e9s and other distribution channels.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Capital One Financial\nCorporation\u2019s principal operating subsidiary\nwas Capital One, National Association\n(\u201cCONA\u201d). On October 1, 2022, the Company\ncomplet ed the merger of Capital One Bank\n(USA), National Association (\u201cCOBNA\u201d), with\nand into CONA, with CONA as the surviving\nentity (the \u201cBank Merger\u201d).\nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d References to the\n\u201cBank\u201d shall mean and refer to (i) CONA from\nand after the Bank Merger and (ii) CONA and\nCOBNA collectively prior to the Bank Merger.\nWe also offer products outside of the United\nStates of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) principally through\nCapital One (Europe) plc (\u201cCOEP\u201d), an indirect\nsubsidiary of CONA organized and located in\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), and through a\nbranch of CONA in Canada. Both COEP and our\nCanadian branch of CONA have the authority to\nprovide credit card loans.\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into threemajor\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We\nprovide details on our business segments, the\nintegration of recent acquisitions, if any,\ninto our business segments and the allocation\nmethodologies and accounting policies used to\nderive our business segment results in \u201cNote\n17\u2014Business Segments and Revenue from\nContracts with Customers.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements have been prepared in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles\nin the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of\nthe consolidated financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and in the related\ndisclosures. These estimates are based on\ninformation available as of the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements. While\nmanagement makes its best judgments, actual\namounts or results could differ from these\nestimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Capital One Financial\nCorporation and all other entities in which we\nhave a controlling financial interest. We\ndetermine whether we have a controlling\nfinancial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting\ninterest entity (\u201cVOE\u201d) or a variable interest\nentity (\u201cVIE\u201d). All significant intercompany\naccount balances and transactions have been\neliminated.\nVoting Interest Entities\nVOEs are entities that have sufficient equity\nand provide the equity investors voting rights\nthat give them the power to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations.\nSince a controlling financial interest in an\nentity is typically obtained through ownership\nof a majority voting interest, we consolidate\nour majority-owned subsidiaries and other\nvoting interest entities in which we hold,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 50% of the\nvoting rights or where we exercise control\nthrough other contractual rights.\nInvestments in which we do not hold a\ncontrolling financial interest but have\nsignificant influence over the entity\u2019s\nfinancial and operating decisions are\naccounted for under the equity method. If we\ndo not have significant influence, we measure\nequity investments at fair value with changes\nin fair value recorded through net income,\nexcept those that do not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value (for which a\nmeasurement alternative is applied). We report\nequity investments in other assets on our\nconsolidated balance sheets and include our\nshare of income or loss and dividends from\nthose investments in other non-interest income\nin our consolidated statements of income.\n                                              \n  123    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (i)\nlack sufficient equity to permit the entity to\nfinance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other\nparties; or (ii) have equity investors that do\nnot have the ability to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations\nthrough voting rights, or do not have the\nobligation to absorb the expected losses, or\ndo not have the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The entity that is\ndeemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE is\nrequired to consolidate the VIE. An entity is\ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE\nif that entity has both (i) the power to\ndirect the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses or the right to receive benefits that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE.\nIn determining whether we are the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE, we consider both\nqualitative and quantitative factors regarding\nthe nature, size and form of our involvement\nwith the VIE, such as our role in establishing\nthe VIE and our ongoing rights and\nresponsibilities; our economic interests,\nincluding debt and equity investments,\nservicing fees and other arrangements deemed\nto be variable interests in the VIE; the\ndesign of the VIE, including the\ncapitalization structure, subordination of\ninterests, payment priority, relative share of\ninterests held across various classes within\nthe VIE\u2019s capital structure and the reasons\nwhy the interests are held by us.\nWe perform on-going reassessments to evaluate\nwhether changes in an entity\u2019s capital\nstructure or changes in the nature of our\ninvolvement with the entity result in a change\nto the VIE designation or a change to our\nconsolidation conclusion. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Variable\nInterest Entities and Securitizations\u201d for\nfurther details.\nBalance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets\nand Liabilities\nDerivative contracts that we execute\nbilaterally in the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nmarket or are centrally cleared are generally\ngoverned by enforceable master netting\nagreements where we generally have the right\nto offset exposure with the same counterparty.\nEither counterparty can generally request to\nnet settle all contracts through a single\npayment upon default on, or termination of,\nany one contract. We elect to offset the\nderivative assets and liabilities under master\nnetting agreements for balance sheet\npresentation where a right of setoff exists.\nFor derivative contracts entered into under\nmaster netting agreements for which we have\nnot been able to confirm the enforceability of\nthe setoff rights, or those not subject to\nmaster netting agreements, we do not offset\nour derivative positions for balance sheet\npresentation. See \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities\u201d for more\ndetails.\nWe also elect to present securities purchased\nor sold under resale or repurchase agreements\non a net basis when a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement exists and other\napplicable criteria are met. Security\ncollateral received from or pledged to the\ncounterparties are not eligible for netting\nand are presented gross in our consolidated\nbalance sheet. See \u201cNote 8\u2014Deposits and\nBorrowings\u201d and \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities\u201d for more details.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and due\nfrom banks, interest-bearing deposits and\nother short-term investments, all of which, if\napplicable, have stated maturities of three\nmonths or less when acquired.\nSecurities Resale and Repurchase Agreements\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\nand securities loaned or sold under agreements\nto repurchase, principally U.S. government and\nagency obligations, are not accounted for as\nsales but as collateralized financing\ntransactions and recorded at the amounts at\nwhich the securities were acquired or sold,\nplus accrued interest. We continually monitor\nthe market value of these securities and\ndeliver additional collateral to or obtain\nadditional collateral from counterparties, as\nappropriate. See \u201cNote 8\u2014Deposits and\nBorrowings\u201d\nInvestment Securities\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of\nthe following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise or agency\n(\u201cAgency\u201d) and non-agency residential\nmortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d); Agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities\n(\u201cCMBS\u201d); and other securities. The accounting\nand measurement framework for our investment\nsecurities differs depending on the security\nclassification.\n                                              \n  124    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWe classify securities as available for sale\nor held to maturity based on our investment\nstrategy and management\u2019s assessment of our\nintent and ability to hold the securities\nuntil maturity. We did not have any securities\nthat were classified as held to maturity as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\nWe report securities available for sale on our\nconsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The\namortized cost of investment securities\nreflects the amount for which the security was\nacquired, adjusted for accrued interest,\namortization of premiums, discounts, and net\ndeferred fees and costs, any applicable fair\nvalue hedge accounting adjustments, collection\nof cash, and charge-offs. Unrealized gains or\nlosses are recorded, net of tax, as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Unamortized premiums,\ndiscounts and other basis adjustments for\navailable for sale securities are generally\nrecognized in interest income over the\ncontractual lives of the securities using the\ninterest method. However, premiums on certain\ncallable investment securities are amortized\nto the earliest call date. We record purchases\nand sales of investment securities available\nfor sale on a trade date basis. Realized gains\nor losses from the sale of debt securities are\ncomputed using the first-in first-out method\nof identification, and are included in non-\ninterest income in our consolidated statements\nof income. We elect to present accrued\ninterest for securities available for sale\nwithin interest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nAn individual debt security is impaired when\nthe fair value of the security is less than\nits amortized cost. If we intend to sell an\navailable for sale security in an unrealized\nloss position or it is more likely than not\nthat we will be required to sell the security\nprior to recovery of its amortized cost basis,\nany allowance for credit losses is reversed\nthrough our provision for credit losses and\nthe difference between the amortized cost\nbasis of the security and its fair value is\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nFor impaired debt securities that we have both\nthe intent and ability to hold, the securities\nare evaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. The allowance for credit losses on our\ninvestment securities is recognized through\nour provision for credit losses and limited by\nthe unrealized losses of a security measured\nas the difference between the security\u2019s\namortized cost and fair value. See further\ndiscussion below under the \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses - Available for Sale Investment\nSecurities\u201d section of this Note.\n\nOur investment portfolio also includes certain\ndebt securities that, at the time of purchase,\nhad experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Such debt securities are\naccounted for in accordance with accounting\nguidance for purchased financial assets with\ncredit deterioration and are herein referred\nto as purchased credit-deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d)\nsecurities.\n\nPCD securities require the recognition of an\nallowance for credit losses at the time of\nacquisition. The allowance for credit losses\nis not recognized in provision for credit\nlosses. Instead, the purchase price and the\ninitial allowance collectively represent the\namortized cost basis of a PCD security. Any\nnon-credit discount or premium at the date of\nacquisition is amortized into interest income\nover the remaining life of the security.\nSubsequent to the date of purchase, we\nremeasure the allowance for credit losses on\nthe amortized cost basis using the same\npolicies as for other debt securities\navailable for sale and changes are recognized\nthrough our provision for credit losses. See\nfurther discussion below under the \u201cAllowance\nfor Credit Losses - Available for Sale\nInvestment Securities\u201d section of this Note.\n\nWe charge off any portion of an investment\nsecurity that we determine is uncollectible.\nThe amortized cost basis, excluding accrued\ninterest, is charged off through the allowance\nfor credit losses. Accrued interest is charged\noff as a reduction to interest income.\nRecoveries of previously charged off principal\namounts are recognized in our provision for\ncredit losses when received.\n                                              \n  125    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nAllowance for Credit Losses - Available for\nSale Investment Securities\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\nthat represents management\u2019s current estimate\nof expected credit losses over the contractual\nterms of our investment securities classified\nas available for sale. When an investment\nsecurity available for sale is impaired due to\ncredit factors, we recognize a provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income and an allowance for credit losses\non our consolidated balance sheets. Credit\nlosses recognized in the allowance for credit\nlosses are limited to the amount by which the\ninvestment security\u2019s amortized cost basis\nexceeds its fair value. Investment securities\nin unrealized gain positions do not have an\nallowance for credit losses as the investment\nsecurity could be sold at its fair value to\nprevent realization of any credit losses. We\nexclude accrued interest from the fair value\nand amortized cost basis of an investment\nsecurity for purposes of measuring impairment.\nCharge-offs of uncollectible amounts of\ninvestment securities are deducted from the\nallowance for credit losses.\nFor certain of our securities available for\nsale, we have determined that there is no risk\nof impairment due to credit factors. These\ninvestment securities include high quality\ndebt instruments that are issued and\nguaranteed by the United States government and\nits agencies, certain government-sponsored\nenterprises, and certain foreign sovereign\ngovernments or supranational organizations.\nManagement performs periodic assessments to\nreevaluate this conclusion by considering any\nchanges in historical losses, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts.\nWe evaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at\nthe individual security level and determine\nwhether any portion of the decline in fair\nvalue is due to a credit loss. We make this\ndetermination through the use of quantitative\nand qualitative analyses. Our qualitative\nanalysis includes factors such as the extent\nto which fair value is less than amortized\ncost, any changes in the security\u2019s credit\nrating, past defaults or delayed payments, and\nadverse conditions impacting the security or\nissuer. A credit loss exists to the extent\nthat management does not expect to recover the\namortized cost basis.\nFor investment securities which require\nfurther assessment, we perform a quantitative\nanalysis using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology and compare the present value of\nexpected future cash flows from the security\navailable for sale to the security\u2019s amortized\ncost basis. Projected future cash flows\nreflect management\u2019s best estimate and are\nbased on our understanding of past events,\ncurrent conditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts, and are discounted by the\nsecurity\u2019s effective interest rate adjusted\nfor prepayments. The allowance for credit\nlosses for investment securities reflects the\ndifference by which the amortized cost basis\nexceeds the present value of future cash flows\nand is limited to the amount by which the\nsecurity\u2019s amortized cost exceeds its fair\nvalue. See \u201cNote 2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for\nadditional information.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for\ninvestment, including loans held in our\nconsolidated securitization trusts, and loans\nheld for sale and is divided into three\nportfolio segments: credit card, consumer\nbanking and commercial banking loans. Credit\ncard loans consist of domestic and\ninternational credit card loans. Consumer\nbanking loans consist of auto and retail\nbanking loans. Commercial banking loans\nconsist of commercial and multifamily real\nestate loans as well as commercial and\nindustrial loans.\nLoan Classification\nWe classify loans as held for investment or\nheld for sale based on our investment strategy\nand management\u2019s intent and ability with\nregard to the loans, which may change over\ntime. The accounting and measurement framework\nfor loans differs depending on the loan\nclassification, whether we elect the fair\nvalue option, whether the loans are originated\nor purchased and whether purchased loans are\nconsidered to have experienced a more-than-\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination. The presentation within the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows is based\non management\u2019s intent at acquisition or\norigination. Cash flows related to loans that\nare acquired or originated with the intent to\nhold for investment are included in cash flows\nfrom investing activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Cash flows related\nto loans that are acquired or originated with\nthe intent to sell are included in cash flows\nfrom operating activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\nLoans Held for Investment\nLoans that we have the ability and intent to\nhold for the foreseeable future and loans\nassociated with consolidated securitization\ntransactions are classified as held for\ninvestment. Loans classified as held for\ninvestment, except for credit card loans, are\nreported at their amortized cost basis,\nexcluding accrued interest. For these loans,\nwe elect to present accrued interest within\n                                              \n  126    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \ninterest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For credit card loans\nclassified as held for investment, earned\nfinance charges and fees are included in\neither loans held for investment (if they have\nbeen billed to the customer) or interest\nreceivable (if they have not yet been billed\nto the customer).\n\nInterest income is recognized on performing\nloans on an accrual basis. We defer loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts on originated loans, premiums and\ndiscounts on purchased loans and loan\ncommitment fees. We recognize these amounts in\ninterest income as yield adjustments over the\nlife of the loan and/or commitment period\nusing the interest method. For credit card\nloans, loan origination fees and direct loan\norigination costs are amortized on a straight-\nline basis over a 12-month period. The\namortized cost of loans held for investment is\nsubject to our allowance for credit losses\nmethodology described below under the\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\u201d section of this Note.\n\nLoans Held for Sale\n\nLoans that we intend to sell or for which we\ndo not have the ability and intent to hold for\nthe foreseeable future are classified as held\nfor sale. Multifamily commercial real estate\nloans originated with the intent to sell to\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises are accounted\nfor under the fair value option. We elect the\nfair value option on these loans as part of\nour management of interest rate risk along\nwith the corresponding forward sale\ncommitments. Loan origination fees and direct\nloan origination costs are recognized as\nincurred and are reported in other non-\ninterest income in the consolidated statements\nof income. Interest income is calculated based\non the loan's stated rate of interest and is\nreported in interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of income. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nAll other loans classified as held for sale\nare recorded at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue. Loan origination fees, direct loan\norigination costs and any discounts and\npremiums are deferred until the loan is sold\nand are then recognized as part of the total\ngain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans\nheld for sale is determined on an aggregate\nportfolio basis for each loan type. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nIf a loan is transferred from held for\ninvestment to held for sale, then on the\ntransfer date, any decline in fair value\nrelated to credit is recorded as a charge-off\nand any remaining allowance for credit losses\nis reversed through our provision for credit\nlosses. The loan is then reclassified to held\nfor sale at its amortized cost at the date of\nthe transfer. A valuation allowance is\nestablished, if needed, such that the loan\nheld for sale is recorded at the lower of cost\nor fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we\nreport write-downs or recoveries in fair value\nup to the carrying value at the date of\ntransfer and realized gains or losses on loans\nheld for sale in our consolidated statements\nof income as a component of other non-interest\nincome. We calculate the gain or loss on loan\nsales as the difference between the proceeds\nreceived and the carrying value of the loans\nsold, net of the fair value of any interests\nretained.\n\nLoans Acquired\n\nAll purchased loans, including loans\ntransferred in a business combination, are\ninitially recorded at fair value, which\nincludes consideration of expected future\nlosses, as of the date of the acquisition. To\ndetermine the fair value of loans at\nacquisition, we estimate discounted\ncontractual cash flows due using an observable\nmarket rate of interest, when available,\nadjusted for factors that a market participant\nwould consider in determining fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, contractual cash flows\nare adjusted to include prepayment estimates\nbased upon historical payment trends,\nforecasted default rates and loss severities\nand other relevant factors. The difference\nbetween the fair value and the contractual\ncash flows is recorded as a loan premium or\ndiscount, which may relate to either credit or\nnon-credit factors, at acquisition.\n\nWe account for purchased loans under the\naccounting guidance for purchased financial\nassets with credit deterioration when, at the\ntime of purchase, the loans have experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination. We refer to\nthese loans which are accounted for under\naccounting guidance for purchased financial\nassets with more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination as \u201cPCD loans.\u201d\n\nWe recognize an allowance for credit losses on\npurchased loans that have not experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination at the time\nof purchase through earnings in a manner that\nis consistent with originated loans. The\npolicies relating to the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans is described below in the\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\u201d section of this Note.\n                                              \n  127    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nLoan Modifications and Restructurings\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide modifications to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty to improve\nlong-term collectability of the loan and to\navoid the need for foreclosure or repossession\nof collateral, if any. Our loan modifications\ntypically include short-term payment\ndeferrals, an extension of the loan term, a\nreduction in the interest rate, a reduction in\nthe loan balance, or a combination of these\nmodifications. A loan modification in which a\nconcession is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty is accounted\nfor and reported as a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d). See \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for\nadditional information on our loan\nmodifications and restructurings, including\nthose in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDelinquent and Nonperforming Loans\nThe entire balance of a loan is considered\ncontractually delinquent if the minimum\nrequired payment is not received by the first\nstatement cycle date equal to or following the\ndue date specified on the customer\u2019s billing\nstatement. Delinquency is reported on loans\nthat are 30or more days past due. Interest and\nfees continue to accrue on past due loans\nuntil the date the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, if applicable. For loan\nmodifications, delinquency and nonaccrual\nstatus are reported in accordance with the\nrevised terms of the loans. We generally place\nloans on nonaccrual status when we believe the\ncollectability of interest and principal is\nnot reasonably assured.\n\nNonperforming loans generally include loans\nthat have been placed on nonaccrual status.\nLoans classified as held for sale are excluded\nfrom nonperforming classification\nconsideration.\n\nOur policies for classifying loans as\nnonperforming, by loan category, are as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 C redit card loans: As permitted by\nregulatory guidance issued by the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council\n(\u201cFFIEC\u201d), our policy is generally to exempt\ncredit card loans from being classified as\nnonperforming, as these loans are generally\ncharged off in the period the account becomes\n180days past due. Consistent with industry\nconventions, we generally continue to accrue\ninterest and fees on delinquent credit card\nloans until the loans are charged off.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We classify consumer\nbanking loans as nonperforming when we\ndetermine that the collectability of all\ninterest and principal on the loan is not\nreasonably assured, generally when the loan\nbecomes 90days past due.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans : We classify\ncommercial banking loans as nonperforming as\nof the date we determine that the\ncollectability of all interest and principal\non the loan is not reasonably assured.\n\n\u2022 Modified loans and troubled debt\nrestructurings: Modified loans, including\nTDRs, that are current at the time of the\nrestructuring remain in accrual status if\nthere is demonstrated performance prior to the\nrestructuring and continued performance under\nthe modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the\nmodified loan is classified as nonperforming.\n\nInterest and fees accrued but not collected at\nthe date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status\nare reversed against earnings. In addition,\nthe amortization of deferred loan fees, costs,\npremiums and discounts is suspended. Interest\nand fee income are subsequently recognized\nonly upon the receipt of cash payments.\nHowever, if there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectability of loan principal,\ncash received is generally applied against the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status\nwhen all principal and interest is current and\nrepayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest is reasonably assured,\nor when the loan is both well-secured and in\nthe process of collection and collectability\nis no longer doubtful.\n                                              \n  128    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nCharge-Offs\nWe charge off loans when we determine that the\nloan is uncollectible. The amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, is charged\noff as a reduction to the allowance for credit\nlosses based on the time frames presented\nbelow. Accrued interest on loans other than\ncredit card loans determined to be\nuncollectible is reversed as a reduction of\ninterest income when the loan is classified as\nnonperforming. For credit card loans, accrued\ninterest is charged off simultaneously with\nthe charge off of other components of\namortized cost and as a reduction of interest\nincome. When received, recoveries of\npreviously charged off amounts are recorded as\nan increase to the allowance for credit losses\n(see the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note for\ninformation on how we account for expected\nrecoveries). Costs to recover charged off\nloans are recorded as collection expense and\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense as incurred. Our charge-off time\nframes by loan type are presented below.\n\n\u2022 Credit card loans : We generally charge off\ncredit card loans in the period the account\nbecomes 180days past due. We charge off\ndelinquent credit card loans for which\nrevolving privileges have been revoked as part\nof loan workout when the account becomes\n120days past due. Credit card loans in\nbankruptcy are generally charged off by the\nend of the month following 30days after the\nreceipt of a complete bankruptcy notification\nfrom the bankruptcy court. Credit card loans\nof deceased account holders are generally\ncharged off 5days after receipt of\nnotification.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We generally charge\noff consumer banking loans at the earlier of\nthe date when the account is a specified\nnumber of days past due or upon repossession\nof the underlying collateral. Our charge-off\nperiod for auto loans is 120days past due.\nSmall business banking loans generally charge\noff at 120days past due or based on the date\nthe amortized cost basis is deemed\nuncollectible. Auto loans that have not been\npreviously charged off where the borrower has\nfiled for bankruptcy and the loan has not been\nreaffirmed charge off in the period that the\nloan is 60days from the bankruptcy\nnotification date, regardless of delinquency\nstatus. Auto loans that have not been\npreviously charged off and have been\ndischarged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are\ncharged off at the end of the month in which\nthe bankruptcy discharge occurs. Remaining\nconsumer loans generally are charged off\nwithin 40days of receipt of notification from\nthe bankruptcy court. Consumer loans of\ndeceased account holders are charged off by\nthe end of the month following 60days of\nreceipt of notification.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans: We charge off\ncommercial loans in the period we determine\nthat the amortized cost basis is\nuncollectible.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\n(\u201callowance\u201d) that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\nover the contractual terms of our loans held\nfor investment. We measure the allowance on a\nquarterly basis through consideration of past\nevents, including historical experience,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts.\n\nWe measure current expected credit losses over\nthe contractual terms of our loans. The\ncontractual terms are adjusted for expected\nprepayments but are not extended for renewals\nor extensions, except when an extension or\nrenewal arises from a borrower option that is\nnot unconditionally cancellable or through a\nTDR that is reasonably expected to occur.\n\nWe aggregate loans sharing similar risk\ncharacteristics into pools for purposes of\nmeasuring expected credit losses. Pools are\nreassessed periodically to confirm that all\nloans within each pool continue to share\nsimilar risk characteristics. Expected credit\nlosses for loans that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with other financial\nassets are measured individually.\n\nExpected recoveries of amounts previously\ncharged off or expected to be charged off are\nrecognized within the allowance, with a\ncorresponding reduction to our provision for\ncredit losses. At times expected recoveries\nmay result in a negative allowance. We limit\nthe allowance recovery expectations to amounts\npreviously charged off and expected to be\ncharged off. Charge-offs of uncollectible\namounts result in a reduction to the allowance\nand recoveries of previously charged off\namounts result in an increase to the\nallowance.\n                                              \n  129    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWhen developing an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information, or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Significant judgment is\napplied to the development and duration of\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used in\nour estimation of lifetime losses. We estimate\nexpected credit losses over the duration of\nthose forecasts and then revert, on a rational\nand systematic basis, to historical losses at\neach relevant loss component of the estimate.\nExpected losses for contractual terms\nextending beyond the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast and reversion periods are\nbased on those historical losses.\n\nManagement will consider and may qualitatively\nadjust for conditions, changes and trends in\nloan portfolios that may not be captured in\nmodeled results. These adjustments are\nreferred to as qualitative factors and\nrepresent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses. Management\u2019s\njudgment may involve an assessment of current\nand forward-looking conditions including but\nnot limited to changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, nature and volume of the\nportfolio, external factors, and uncertainty\nas it relates to economic, model or forecast\nrisks, where not already captured in the\nmodeled results.\n\nExpected credit losses for collateral-\ndependent loans are based on the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral. When we intend to\nliquidate the collateral, the fair value of\nthe collateral is adjusted for expected costs\nto sell. A loan is deemed to be a collateral-\ndependent loan when (i) we determine\nforeclosure or repossession of the underlying\ncollateral is probable, or (ii) foreclosure or\nrepossession is not probable, but the borrower\nis experiencing financial difficulty and we\nexpect repayment to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the\ncollateral. The allowance for a collateral-\ndependent loan reflects the difference between\nthe loan\u2019s amortized cost basis and the fair\nvalue (less selling costs, where applicable)\nof the loan\u2019s underlying collateral.\n\nOur credit card and consumer banking loan\nportfolios consist of smaller-balance,\nhomogeneous loans. The consumer banking loan\nportfolio is divided into two primary\nportfolio segments: auto loans and retail\nbanking loans. We assess our credit card and\nconsumer banking loan portfolios based on\ncommon risk characteristics, such as\norigination year, contract type, interest\nrate, borrower credit score and geography. The\ncommercial banking loan portfolio is primarily\ncomposed of larger-balance, non-homogeneous\nloans. These loans are subject to reviews that\nresult in internal risk ratings. In assessing\nthe risk rating of a particular commercial\nbanking loan, among the factors we consider\nare the financial condition of the borrower,\ngeography, collateral performance, historical\nloss experience and industry-specific\ninformation that management believes is\nrelevant in determining and measuring expected\ncredit losses. Subjective assessment and\ninterpretation are involved. Emphasizing one\nfactor over another or considering additional\nfactors could impact the risk rating assigned\nto that commercial banking loan.\n\nFor consumer banking and commercial banking\nloans, the contractual period typically does\nnot include renewals or extensions because the\nrenewals and extensions are generally not at\nthe borrower\u2019s exclusive option to exercise.\nThe undrawn credit exposure associated with\nour credit card loans is unconditionally\ncancellable. For this reason, expected credit\nlosses are measured based only on the drawn\nbalance at each quarterly measurement date and\nnot on the undrawn exposure. Because credit\ncard loans do not have a defined contractual\nlife, management estimates both the volume and\napplication of payments to determine a\ncontractual life of the drawn balance at the\nmeasurement date over which expected credit\nlosses are developed for credit card loans.\n\nWith the exception of credit card loans, we\nhave made a policy election to not measure an\nallowance on accrued interest for loans held\nfor investment because we reverse\nuncollectible accrued interest in a timely\nmanner. See the \u201cDelinquent and Nonperforming\nLoans\u201d and \u201cCharge-Offs - Loans\u201d sections of\nthis Note for information on what we consider\ntimely. For credit card loans, we do not make\nthis election, as we reserve for uncollectible\naccrued interest relating to credit card loans\nin the allowance.\n                                              \n  130    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe allowance related to credit card and\nconsumer banking loans assessed on a pooled\nbasis is based on a modeled calculation, which\nis supplemented by management judgment as\ndescribed above. Because of the homogeneous\nnature of our consumer loan portfolios, the\nallowance is based on the aggregated portfolio\nsegment evaluations. The allowance is\nestablished through a process that begins with\nestimates of historical losses in each pool\nbased upon various statistical analyses, with\nadjustments for current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions, which includes expected economic\nconditions. Loss forecast models are utilized\nto estimate expected credit losses and\nconsider several portfolio indicators\nincluding, but not limited to, expected\neconomic conditions, historical loss\nexperience, account seasoning, the value of\ncollateral underlying secured loans, estimated\nforeclosures or defaults based on observable\ntrends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings,\nunemployment, borrower credit scores and\ngeneral business trends. Management also\nconsiders an evaluation of overall portfolio\ncredit quality based on indicators such as\nchanges in our credit evaluation, underwriting\nand collection management policies, the effect\nof other external factors such as competition\nand legal and regulatory requirements, general\neconomic conditions and business trends, and\nuncertainties in forecasting and modeling\ntechniques used in estimating our allowance.\n\nThe allowance related to commercial banking\nloans assessed on a pooled basis is based on\nour historical loss experience for loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics and consideration\nof the current credit quality of the\nportfolio, which is supplemented by management\njudgment as described above. These are\nadjusted for current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions likely to cause future losses which\nvary from historical levels. We apply internal\nrisk ratings to commercial banking loans,\nwhich we use to assess credit quality and\nderive a total loss estimate based on an\nestimated probability of default (\u201cdefault\nrate\u201d) and loss given default (\u201closs\nseverity\u201d). Management may also apply judgment\nto adjust the loss factors derived, taking\ninto consideration both quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including general\neconomic conditions, industry-specific and\ngeographic trends, portfolio concentrations,\ntrends in internal credit quality indicators,\nand current and past underwriting standards\nthat have occurred but are not yet reflected\nin the historical data underlying our loss\nestimates.\n\nThe allowance related to smaller-balance\nhomogeneous credit card and consumer banking\nloans whose terms have been modified in a TDR\nis calculated on a pool basis using historical\nloss experience, adjusted for current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of conditions likely to cause future\nlosses which vary from historical levels for\nthe respective class of assets. The allowance\nrelated to consumer banking loans that are\nassessed at a loan-level is determined based\non key considerations that include the\nborrower\u2019s overall financial condition,\nresources and payment history, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, and when applicable, the estimated\nrealizable value of any collateral. The\nallowance related to commercial banking loans\nthat are assessed at a loan-level is generally\ndetermined in accordance with our policy for\nestimating expected credit losses for\ncollateral-dependent loans as described above.\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures\nIn addition to the allowance, we also measure\nexpected credit losses related to unfunded\nlending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable in our Commercial\nBanking business. This reserve is measured\nusing the same measurement objectives as the\nallowance for loans held for investment and is\nrecorded within other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. These commitments\nare segregated by risk according to our\ninternal risk rating scale, which we use to\nassess credit quality and derive an expected\ncredit loss estimate. We assess these risk\nclassifications, taking into consideration\nboth quantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of conditions likely to\ncause future losses which vary from historical\nlevels, and utilization assumptions to\nestimate the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Expected credit losses are not\nmeasured on unfunded lending commitments that\nare unconditionally cancellable, including all\nof our unfunded credit card and consumer\nbanking lending commitments and certain of our\nunfunded commercial banking lending\ncommitments.\n\nDetermining the appropriateness of the\nallowance and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is complex and requires judgment\nby management about the effect of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. Subsequent\nevaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of\nthe factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments in future\nperiods. See \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments\u201d for additional information.\n                                              \n  131    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nSecuritization of Loans\nOur loan securitization activities primarily\ninvolve the securitization of credit card and\nauto loans, which provides a source of funding\nfor us. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Variable Interest Entities\nand Securitizations\u201d for additional details.\nLoan securitization involves the transfer of a\npool of loan receivables from our portfolio to\na trust. The trust then sells undivided\ninterests in the pool of loan receivables to\nthird-party investors through the issuance of\ndebt securities and transfers the proceeds\nfrom the debt issuance to us as consideration\nfor the loan receivables transferred. The debt\nsecurities are collateralized by the loan\nreceivables transferred from our portfolio. We\nremove loans from our consolidated balance\nsheets if securitizations qualify as sales to\nunconsolidated VIEs, recognize assets retained\nand liabilities assumed at fair value and\nrecord a gain or loss on the transferred\nloans. Alternatively, if the transfer does not\nqualify as a sale but instead is considered a\nsecured borrowing, the assets will remain on\nour consolidated balance sheets with an\noffsetting liability recognized for the amount\nof proceeds received.\nPremises, Equipment and Leases\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold\nimprovements, are carried at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nLand is carried at cost. We capitalize direct\ncosts incurred during the application\ndevelopment stage of internally developed\nsoftware projects. Depreciation and\namortization expenses are calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets. Useful lives for premises\nand equipment are estimated as follows:\n                                              \n  Premises and          Useful Lives          \n  Equipment                                   \n  Buildings and         5-39years             \n  improvements                                \n  Furniture and         3-10years             \n  equipment                                   \n  Computer software     3years                \n  Leasehold             Lesser of the useful  \n  improvements          life or the           \n                        remaining lease term  \n                                              \nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are\nexpensed as incurred and gains or losses upon\ndisposition are recognized in our consolidated\nstatements of income as realized. See \u201cNote\n7\u2014Premises, Equipment and Leases\u201d for\nadditional information.\nLeases\nLease classification is determined at\ninception for all lease transactions with an\ninitial term greater than one year. Operating\nleases are included as right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d)\nassets within other assets, and operating\nlease liabilities are classified as other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets. Finance leases are included in\npremises and equipment, and other borrowings\non our consolidated balance sheets. Our\noperating lease expense is included in\noccupancy and equipment within non-interest\nexpense in our consolidated statements of\nincome. Lease expense for minimum lease\npayments are recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. See \u201cNote\n7\u2014Premises, Equipment and Leases\u201d for\nadditional information.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred, plus\nthe fair value of any non-controlling\ninterests in the acquiree, over the fair value\nof the net assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed as of the acquisition date and is\nassigned to one or more reporting units at\nacquisition. A reporting unit is defined as an\noperating segment, or a business unit that is\none level below an operating segment. We have\nfourreporting units: Credit Card, Auto\nFinance, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial\nBanking. Goodwill is not amortized but is\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit\nlevel annually or more frequently if adverse\ncircumstances indicate that it is more likely\nthan not that the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value. These\nindicators could include a sustained,\nsignificant decline in the Company\u2019s stock\nprice, a decline in expected future cash\nflows, significant disposition activity, a\nsignificant adverse change in the economic or\nbusiness environment, and the testing for\nrecoverability of a significant asset group,\namong others.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are\namortized on either an accelerated or\nstraight-line basis over their estimated\nuseful lives and are evaluated for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying amount of the assets may\nnot be recoverable. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and\nOther Intangible Assets\u201d for additional\ninformation.\n                                              \n  132    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) are\ninitially recorded at fair value when mortgage\nloans are sold or securitized in the secondary\nmarket and the right to service these loans is\nretained for a fee. Commercial MSRs are\nsubsequently accounted for under the\namortization method. We evaluate for\nimpairment as of each reporting date and\nrecognize any impairment in other non-interest\nincome. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets\u201d for additional information.\nForeclosed Property and Repossessed Assets\nForeclosed property and repossessed assets\nobtained through our lending activities\ntypically include commercial real estate or\npersonal property, such as automobiles, and\nare recorded at net realizable value. For\nforeclosed property and repossessed assets, we\ngenerally reclassify the loan to repossessed\nassets upon repossession of the property in\nsatisfaction of the loan. Net realizable value\nis the estimated fair value of the underlying\ncollateral less estimated selling costs and is\nbased on appraisals, when available.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, foreclosed\nproperty and repossessed assets are recorded\nat the lower of our initial cost basis or net\nrealizable value, which is routinely monitored\nand updated. Any changes in net realizable\nvalue and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of the property are recorded in\nother non-interest expense. See \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair\nValue Measurement\u201d for details.\nRestricted Equity Investments\nWe have investments in Federal Home Loan Bank\n(\u201cFHLB\u201d) stock and in Federal Reserve Bank\nstock. These investments, which are included\nin other assets on our consolidated balance\nsheets, are not marketable, are carried at\ncost, and are reviewed for impairment if there\nis any indicator of impairment.\n\nLitigation\n\nWe establish reserves for litigation-related\nmatters that arise from the ordinary course of\nour business activities when it is probable\nthat a loss associated with a claim or\nproceeding has been incurred and the amount of\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated.\nProfessional service costs, including fees for\nattorneys and experts, expected to be incurred\nin connection with a loss contingency are\nexpensed as services are provided. See \u201cNote\n18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and\nOthers\u201d for additional information.\n\nCustomer Rewards Reserve\n\nWe offer products, primarily credit cards,\nwhich include programs that allow members to\nearn rewards based on account activity that\ncan be redeemed for cash (primarily in the\nform of statement credits), gift cards,\ntravel, or covering eligible charges. The\namount of reward that a customer earns varies\nbased on the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program and product. When rewards are\nearned by a customer, rewards expense is\ngenerally recorded as an offset to interchange\nincome, with a corresponding increase to the\ncustomer rewards reserve. The customer rewards\nreserve is computed based on the estimated\nfuture cost of earned rewards that are\nexpected to be redeemed and is reduced as\nrewards are redeemed. In estimating the\ncustomer rewards reserve, we consider\nhistorical redemption and spending behavior,\nas well as the terms and conditions of the\ncurrent rewards programs, among other factors.\nOur customer rewards reserve assumes the vast\nmajority of all rewards earned will eventually\nbe redeemed.\n\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest Income and Fees\nInterest income and fees on loans and\ninvestment securities are recognized based on\nthe contractual provisions of the underlying\narrangements.\nLoan origination fees, direct loan origination\ncosts, premiums and discounts on loans held\nfor investment are deferred and generally\namortized into interest income as yield\nadjustments over the contractual life and/or\ncommitment period using the interest method.\nCosts deferred include, among other things,\nincentives paid to our network of auto dealers\nfor loan referrals. In certain circumstances,\nwe elect to factor prepayment estimates into\nthe calculation of the constant effective\nyield necessary to apply the interest method.\nPrepayment estimates are based on historical\nprepayment data, existing and forecasted\ninterest rates,\n                                              \n  133    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nand economic data. For credit card loans, loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts are amortized on a straight-line basis\nover a 12-month period.\n\nUnamortized premiums, discounts and other\nbasis adjustments on investment securities are\ngenerally recognized in interest income over\nthe contractual lives of the securities using\nthe interest method. However, premiums for\ncertain callable investment securities are\namortized to the earliest call date.\n\nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare recorded in revenue when earned and\npresented on our consolidated balance sheets\nwithin either loan receivables (if they have\nbeen billed to the customer) or interest\nreceivable (if they have not yet been billed\nto the customer). Annual membership fees are\nclassified as service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees in our consolidated\nstatements of income and are deferred and\namortized into income over 12months on a\nstraight-line basis.\nInterchange Income\nInterchange income generally represents fees\nfor standing ready to authorize and providing\nsettlement on credit and debit card\ntransactions processed through the MasterCard\u00ae\n(\u201cMasterCard\u201d) and Visa\u00ae (\u201cVisa\u201d) interchange\nnetworks. The levels and structure of\ninterchange rates set by MasterCard and Visa\ncan vary based on cardholder purchase volumes,\namong other factors. We recognize interchange\nincome upon settlement. See \u201cNote 17\u2014Business\nSegments and Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers\u201d for additional details.\nCard Partnership Agreements\nWe have contractual agreements with certain\nretailers and other partners to provide\nlending and other services to a mutual\ncustomer base. We primarily issue private-\nlabel and cobrand credit card loans to these\ncustomers over the terms of the partnership\nagreements.\n\nCertain partners assist in or perform\nmarketing activities on our behalf and promote\nour products and services to their customers.\nAs compensation for providing these services,\nwe often pay royalties, bounties or other\nspecial bonuses to these partners. Our\npayments to partners are generally recorded as\nreductions of revenue or as marketing\nexpenses, depending on their nature. Our\ncredit card partnership agreements may also\nprovide for profit or revenue sharing payments\nwhich are presented as a reduction of the\nrelated revenue line item(s) when owed to the\npartner.\n\nWhen a partner agrees to share a portion of\nthe credit losses associated with the\npartnership, we evaluate the contractual\nprovisions for the loss share payments as well\nas applicable accounting guidance to determine\nwhether to present the sharing of losses on a\ngross or net basis in our consolidated\nfinancial statements. When loss sharing\namounts due from partners are presented on a\nnet basis, they are recorded as a reduction to\nour provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and reduce\nthe charge-off amounts that we report. The\nallowance for credit losses attributable to\nthese portfolios is also reduced by the\nexpected reimbursements from these partners\nfor loss sharing amounts. See \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for additional\ninformation related to our loss sharing\narrangements.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nA collaborative arrangement is a contractual\narrangement that involves a joint operating\nactivity between two or more parties that are\nactive participants in the activity. These\nparties are exposed to significant risks and\nrewards based upon the economic success of the\njoint operating activity. We assess each of\nour partnership agreements with profit,\nrevenue or loss sharing payments to determine\nif a collaborative arrangement exists and, if\nso, how revenue generated from third parties,\ncosts incurred and transactions between\nparticipants in the collaborative arrangement\nshould be accounted for and reported on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nOne partnership agreement met the definition\nof a collaborative arrangement as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020. This agreement was amended\nin the first quarter of 2022. While we\ncontinue to share a fixed percentage of\nrevenues consisting of finance charges and\nlate fees with the partner, and the partner is\nrequired to reimburse us for a fixed\npercentage of credit losses incurred, the\namended agreement does not meet the definition\nof a collaborative arrangement. Revenues and\nlosses related to the partner\u2019s credit card\nprogram and partnership agreement are reported\non a net basis in our consolidated financial\nstatements. Revenue sharing amounts\nattributable to the partner are recorded as an\noffset against total net revenue in our\nconsolidated statements of income. Interest\nincome was reduced by $ 1.0billion and $\n1.1billion in the years ended December 31,\n2021 and\n                                              \n  134    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n2020, respectively, for amounts earned by the\npartner during the years this agreement met\nthe definition of a collaborative arrangement.\nThe impact of all of our loss sharing\narrangements that are presented on a net basis\nis included in \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe are authorized to issue stock\u2013based\ncompensation to employees and directors in\nvarious forms, primarily as restricted stock\nunits (\u201cRSUs\u201d), performance share units\n(\u201cPSUs\u201d) and stock options. In addition, we\nalso issue cash-settled RSUs which are not\ncounted against the common shares reserved for\nissuance or available for issuance because\nthey are settled in cash.\nFor awards settled in shares, we generally\nrecognize compensation expense on a straight-\nline basis over the award\u2019s requisite service\nperiod based on the fair value of the award at\nthe grant date. If an award settled in shares\ncontains a performance condition with graded\nvesting, we recognize compensation expense\nusing the accelerated attribution method.\nRestricted stock units that are cash-settled\nare accounted for as liability awards which\nresults in quarterly expense fluctuations\nbased on changes in our stock price through\nthe date that the awards are settled. Awards\nto participants that are eligible for\nretirement or become eligible during the\nvesting period are expensed immediately or\nover the time period between the grant date\nand when the participant becomes retirement\neligible, respectively. Stock-based\ncompensation expense is included in salaries\nand associate benefits in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\nFor RSUs and performance share units, the fair\nvalue of stock-based compensation used in\ndetermining compensation expense will\ngenerally equal the fair market value of our\ncommon stock on the date of grant. Stock-based\ncompensation expense for equity classified\nstock options is based on the grant date fair\nvalue, which is estimated using a Black-\nScholes option pricing model. Certain share-\nsettled awards have discretionary vesting\nconditions which result in the remeasurement\nof these awards at fair value each reporting\nperiod and the potential for compensation\nexpense to fluctuate with changes in our stock\nprice. See \u201cNote 13\u2014Stock-Based Compensation\nPlans\u201d for additional details.\nMarketing Expenses\nMarketing expense includes the cost of our\nvarious promotional efforts to attract and\nretain customers such as advertising,\npromotional materials, and certain customer\nincentives, including spend-based bonuses. We\nexpense marketing costs as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize the current and deferred tax\nconsequences of all transactions that have\nbeen recognized in the financial statements\nusing the provisions of the enacted tax laws.\nCurrent income tax expense represents our\nestimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period and includes income tax expense\nrelated to our uncertain tax positions, as\nwell as tax-related interest and penalties.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that will be in\neffect when the differences are expected to\nreverse. We record valuation allowances to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. We\nrecord the effect of remeasuring deferred tax\nassets and liabilities due to a change in tax\nrates or laws as a component of income tax\nexpense related to continuing operations for\nthe period in which the change is enacted. We\nsubsequently release income tax effects\nstranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach.\nIncome tax benefits are recognized when, based\non their technical merits, they are more\nlikely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination. The amount recognized is the\nlargest amount of benefit that is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement. See\n\u201cNote 15\u2014Income Taxes\u201d for additional details.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated and reported\nunder the \u201ctwo-class\u201d method. The \u201ctwo-class\u201d\nmethod is an earnings allocation method under\nwhich earnings per share is calculated for\neach class of common stock and participating\nsecurity considering both dividends declared\nor accumulated and participation rights in\nundistributed earnings as if all such earnings\nhad been distributed during the period. We\nhave unvested share-based payment awards which\nhave a right to receive non-forfeitable\ndividends, which are deemed to be\nparticipating securities.\n                                              \n  135    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWe calculate basic earnings per share by\ndividing net income, after deducting dividends\non preferred stock and participating\nsecurities as well as undistributed earnings\nallocated to participating securities, by the\naverage number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period, net of any treasury shares.\nWe calculate diluted earnings per share in a\nsimilar manner after consideration of the\npotential dilutive effect of common stock\nequivalents on the average number of common\nshares outstanding during the period. Common\nstock equivalents include stock options,\nrestricted stock units, and performance share\nunits. Common stock equivalents are calculated\nbased upon the treasury stock method using an\naverage market price of common shares during\nthe period. Dilution is not considered when a\nnet loss is reported. Common stock equivalents\nthat have an antidilutive effect are excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted earnings per\nshare. See \u201cNote 12\u2014Earnings Per Common Share\u201d\nfor additional details.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAll derivative financial instruments, whether\ndesignated in a qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationship or not, are reported at their\nfair value on our consolidated balance sheets\nas either assets or liabilities. See \u201cNote\n9\u2014Derivative Instruments and Hedging\nActivities\u201d for additional details.\nFair Value\nFair value, also referred to as an exit price,\nis defined as the price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. See\n\u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value Measurement\u201d for\nadditional information.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nWe account for business combinations under the\nacquisition method of accounting. Under the\nacquisition method, tangible and intangible\nidentifiable assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed and any non-controlling interest in\nthe acquiree are recorded at fair value as of\nthe acquisition date, with limited exceptions.\nTransaction costs and costs to restructure the\nacquired company are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill is recognized as the excess of the\nacquisition price over the estimated fair\nvalue of the identifiable net assets acquired.\nLikewise, if the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is greater than the acquisition\nprice, a bargain purchase gain is recognized\nand recorded in other non-interest income.\nIf the acquired set of activities and assets\ndo not meet the accounting definition of a\nbusiness, the transaction is accounted for as\nan asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition,\nthe assets acquired are recorded at the\npurchase price plus any transaction costs\nincurred and no goodwill is recognized.\n                                              \n  136    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nAccounting Standards Adopted During the Twelve\nMonths Ended December 31, 2022\n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                 The            We adopted    \n                 amendments     this          \n                 in this ASU    guidance in   \n                 establish      the second    \n                 the            quarter of    \n  Fair Value     portfolio-\u2026    2022 using    \n  Hedging        method         the           \n  ASU No.        which          prospective   \n  2022-01,       provides       method of     \n  Derivatives    flexibility    adoption.     \n  and Hedging    to achieve     Our adoption  \n  (Topic         fair value     of this       \n  815):Fair      hedge          standard did  \n  Value          accounting     not have an   \n  Hedging -      for            impact on     \n  Portfolio      multiple       our           \n  Layering       hedged         consolidated  \n  Method         layers         financial     \n  Issued         within a       statements    \n  March 2022     single         as any        \n                 closed         designation   \n                 portfolio      of portfolio  \n                 of             layer method  \n                 financial      hedges would  \n                 assets.        be applied    \n                                prospective\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  137    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                \n  NOTE 2\u2014INVESTMENT SECURITIES  \n                                \nOur investment securities portfolio consists\nof the following: U.S. government-sponsored\nenterprise or agency (\u201cAgency\u201d) and non-agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities\n(\u201cRMBS\u201d), agency commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities (\u201cCMBS\u201d), U.S. Treasury securities\nand other securities.

and manage\nour exposure to credit risk. We discuss these\nrisks and our credit quality indicator for\neach portfolio segment below.\n\nCredit Card\n\nOur credit card loan portfolio is highly\ndiversified across millions of accounts and\nnumerous geographies without significant\nindividual exposure. We therefore generally\nmanage credit risk based on portfolios with\ncommon risk characteristics. The risk in our\ncredit card loan portfolio correlates to broad\neconomic trends, such as unemployment rates\nand the U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product\n(\u201cGDP\u201d) Rate, as well as consumers\u2019 financial\ncondition, all of which can have a material\neffect on credit performance. The key\nindicator we assess in monitoring the credit\nquality and risk of our credit card loan\nportfolio is delinquency trends, including an\nanalysis of loan migration between delinquency\ncategories over time.\nThe table below presents our credit card\nportfolio by delinquency status as of December\n31, 2022 and 2021.\nTable 3.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  143    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nConsumer Banking\nOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists\nof auto and retail banking loans. Similar to\nour credit card loan portfolio, the risk in\nour consumer banking loan portfolio correlates\nto broad economic trends as well as consumers\u2019\nfinancial condition, all of which can have a\nmaterial effect on credit performance. The key\nindicator we monitor when assessing the credit\nquality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is\nborrower credit scores as they measure the\ncreditworthiness of borrowers. Delinquency\ntrends are the key indicator we assess in\nmonitoring the credit quality and risk of our\nretail banking loan portfolio.\nThe table below presents our consumer banking\nportfolio of loans held for investment by\ncredit quality indicator as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021. We present our auto loan\nportfolio by FICO scores at origination and\nour retail banking loan portfolio by\ndelinquency status, which includes all past\ndue loans, both performing and nonperforming.\nTable 3.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by\nCredit Quality Indicator\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  144    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Amounts represent period-end loans held\nfor investment in each credit score category.\nAuto credit scores generally represent average\nFICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus\nat the time of application and are not\nrefreshed thereafter.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses. Generally, loans that are\ndesignated as criticized performing and\ncriticized nonperforming are reviewed\nquarterly by management to determine if they\nare appropriately classified/rated and whether\nany impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are\nalso generally reviewed, at least annually, to\ndetermine the appropriate risk rating. In\naddition, we evaluate the risk rating during\nthe renewal process of any loan or if a loan\nbecomes past due.\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021. The internal risk rating status\nincludes all past due loans, both performing\nand nonperforming.\nTable 3.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by\nInternal Risk Ratings\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  146    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Criticized exposures correspond to the\n\u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d and\n\u201cDoubtful\u201d asset categories defined by bank\nregulatory authorities.\n                                              \n  147    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (one to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectability of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications, whether or not that\nmodification is classified as a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d), when estimating the\ncredit quality of our loan portfolio and\nestablishing allowance levels.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. Significant judgment is applied in\nour estimation of lifetime credit losses. When\ndeveloping an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Our estimate of\nexpected credit losses includes a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period of one year\nand then reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses at each relevant loss\ncomponent of the estimate. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nFor credit card loans, accrued interest is\ncharged off simultaneously with the charge off\nof other components of amortized cost as a\nreduction of revenue. Total net revenue was\nreduced by $ 946million, $ 629million and $\n1.1billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, for finance charge and fees\ncharged-off as uncollectible.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d for further discussion of the\nmethodology and policy for determining our\nallowance for credit losses for each of our\nloan portfolio segments, as well as\ninformation on our reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020. Our allowance for credit losses\nincreased by $ 1.8billion to $ 13.2billion as\nof December 31, 2022 from 2021.\nTable 4.1: Allowance for Credit Losses and\nReserve for Unfunded Lending

losses,\nwith a corresponding increase to credit card\nloans held for investment.\n\n(2) The amount and timing of recoveries are\nimpacted by our collection strategies, which\nare based on customer behavior and risk\nprofile and include direct customer\ncommunications, repossession of collateral,\nthe periodic sale of charged off loans as well\nas additional strategies, such as litigation.\n\n(3) Includes an allowance release of $\n327million for a partnership credit card loan\nportfolio transferred to held for sale in the\nthird quarter of 2020.\n\n(4) Primarily represents foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments and, in periods of\nacquisition, initial allowance builds for\npurchase credit-deteriorated loans.\n                                              \n  152

are presented within our\nconsolidated financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses. See \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\u201d for further discussion of\nour credit card partnership agreements.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in the\nestimated reimbursements from these partners\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021\nand 2020.\nTable 4.2: Summary of Credit Card Partnership\nLoss Sharing Arrangements Impacts\n                                              \n                Year                          \n               Ended                          \n  (Dol\u2026       Decem\u2026                          \n  in             31,                          \n  mill\u2026         2022        2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Esti\u2026                                       \n  reim\u2026                                       \n  from                                        \n  part\u2026    $   1,450    $  2,159    $  2,166  \n  begi\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  peri\u2026                                       \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  due                                         \n  from                                        \n  part\u2026         -515        -438        -959  \n  which                                       \n  redu\u2026                                       \n  net                                         \n  char\u2026                                       \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  expe\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  beco\u2026                                       \n  due                                         \n  from                                        \n  (to)                                        \n  part\u2026          623        -271         952  \n  which                                       \n  redu\u2026                                       \n  (inc\u2026                                       \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  for                                         \n  cred\u2026                                       \n  loss\u2026                                       \n  Esti\u2026                                       \n  reim\u2026                                       \n  from                                        \n  part\u2026    $   1,558    $  1,450    $  2,159  \n  end                                         \n  of                                          \n  peri\u2026                                       \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Includes effects from adoption of the CECL\nstandard in the first quarter of 2020.\n                                              \n  153    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                         \n  NOTE 5\u2014VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND  \n  SECURITIZATIONS                        \n                                         \nIn the normal course of business, we enter\ninto various types of transactions with\nentities that are considered to be variable\ninterest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which provide a source of funding for\nus and enable us to transfer a certain portion\nof the economic risk of the loans or related\ndebt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet the maximum amount of any remaining\nfunding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021. We separately\npresent information for consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       19       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       10       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       29       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n                                              \n  154    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       27       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       53       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities of the VIE, which includes the\nseller\u2019s interest and repurchased notes held\nby other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE.

The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n616million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2022, and $ 2.2billion of assets and $\n568million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2021.\n\n(4) Primarily consists of variable interests\nin companies that promote renewable energy\nsources and other equity method investments.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to government-\nsponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nMSRs and service the transferred loans\npursuant to the guidelines set forth by the\nGSEs. As an investor, we hold primarily RMBS,\nCMBS, and ABS in our investment securities\nportfolio, which represent variable interests\nin the respective securitization trusts from\nwhich those securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either solely invest in securities\nissued by the VIE and were not involved in the\ndesign of the VIE or no transfers have\noccurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our\nmaximum exposure to loss as a result of our\ninvolvement with these VIEs is the carrying\nvalue of the MSRs and investment securities on\nour consolidated balance sheets as well as our\ncontractual obligations under loss sharing\narrangements. See \u201cNote 18\u2014Commitments,\nContingencies, Guarantees and Others\u201d for\ninformation about the loss sharing agreements,\n\u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d\nfor information related to our MSRs associated\nwith these securitizations and \u201cNote\n2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for more information\non the securities held in our investment\nsecurities portfolio.

Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritizations involve the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain investments in qualified\naffordable housing projects using the\nproportional amortization method if certain\ncriteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2021, we recognized amortization of $\n637million and $ 633million, respectively, and\ntax credits of $ 664million and $ 644million,\nrespectively, associated with these\ninvestments within income tax provision. The\ncarrying value of our equity investments in\nthese qualified affordable housing projects\nwas $ 4.9billion and $ 4.7billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We\nare periodically required to provide\nadditional financial or other support during\nthe period of the investments. Our liability\nfor these unfunded commitments was $\n1.8billion and $ 1.7billion as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021 respectively, and is largely\nexpected to be paid from 2023 to 2025.\n                                              \n  156    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.9billion and $ 4.8billion as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021 respectively. The creditors of\nthe VIEs have no recourse to our general\ncredit and we do not provide additional\nfinancial or other support other than during\nthe period that we are contractually required\nto provide it. The total assets of the\nunconsolidated VIE investment funds were\napproximately $ 12.5billion and $ 11.9billion\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.3billion and $ 2.1billion as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nare reflected on our consolidated balance\nsheets in cash, loans held for investment, and\nother assets. The liabilities are reflected in\nother liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs\nhave no recourse to our general credit. We\nhave not provided additional financial or\nother support other than during the period\nthat we are contractually required to provide\nit.\n\nOther\n\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We are not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance. Our maximum exposure to these\nVIEs is limited to the investments on our\nconsolidated balance sheets of $ 337million\nand $ 383million as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.

An impairment of a\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is determined based\non the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value exceeds its fair value, limited\nto the amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit.\n\nThe fair value of reporting units is\ncalculated using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology, a form of the income approach.\nThe calculation uses projected cash flows\nbased on each reporting unit\u2019s internal\nforecast and uses the perpetuity growth method\nto calculate terminal values. These cash flows\nand terminal values are then discounted using\nappropriate discount rates, which are largely\nbased on our external cost of equity with\nadjustments for risk inherent in each\nreporting unit. The carrying amount for a\nreporting unit is the sum of its respective\ncapital requirements, goodwill and other\nintangibles balances. Capital is allocated\nbased on each reporting unit\u2019s specific\nregulatory capital requirements, economic\ncapital requirements, and underlying risks.\nConsolidated stockholder\u2019s equity in excess of\nthe sum of all reporting unit\u2019s capital\nrequirements that is not identified for future\ncapital needs, such as dividends, share\nbuybacks, or other strategic initiatives, is\nallocated to the reporting units and the Other\ncategory and assumed distributed to equity\nholders in future periods. Our discounted cash\nflow analysis requires management to make\njudgments about future loan and deposit\ngrowth, revenue growth, credit losses, and\ncapital rates.

A majority of our\nleases are operating leases of office space,\nretail bank branches and caf\u00e9s. For real\nestate leases, we have elected to account for\nthe lease and non-lease components together as\na single lease component. Our operating leases\nexpire at various dates through 2071, and many\nof them require variable lease payments by us,\nof property taxes, insurance premiums, common\narea maintenance and other costs. Certain of\nthese leases also have extension or\ntermination options, and we assess the\nlikelihood of exercising such options. If it\nis reasonably certain that we will exercise\nthe options, then we include the impact in the\nmeasurement of our right-of-use assets and\nlease liabilities.\nOur right-of-use assets and lease liabilities\nfor operating leases are included in other\nassetsand other liabilitieson our consolidated\nbalance sheets. As most of our operating\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, we use\nour incremental borrowing rate in determining\nthe present value of future lease payments.\nOur operating lease expense is included in\noccupancy and equipment within non-interest\nexpense in our consolidated statements of\nincome. Total operating lease expense consists\nof operating lease cost, which is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term,\nand variable lease cost, which is recognized\nbased on actual amounts incurred. We also\nsublease certain premises, and sublease income\nis included in other non-interest income in\nour consolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables present information about\nour operating lease portfolio and the related\nlease costs as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.\nTable 7.2 Operating Lease Portfolio\n                                              \n

Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency swaps to hedge, but we may\nalso use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We offset the\nmajority of the market risk exposure of our\ncustomer accommodation derivatives through\nderivative transactions with other\ncounterparties.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of AOCI. Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the hedged forecasted\ntransactions impact earnings and presented in\nthe same line item in our consolidated\nstatements of income as the earnings effect of\nthe hedged items. Our cash flow hedges use\ninterest rate swaps and floors that are\nintended to hedge the variability in interest\nreceipts or interest payments on some of our\nvariable-rate financial assets or liabilities.\nWe also enter into foreign currency forward\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to variability\nin cash flows related to intercompany\nborrowings denominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  165    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that stems from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in OTC markets.\nWe also execute interest rate and commodity\nfutures in the exchange-traded derivative\nmarkets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both\ntrades cleared through central counterparty\nclearinghouses (\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared\nbilateral contracts. The Chicago Mercantile\nExchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the Intercontinental\nExchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH Group (\u201cLCH\u201d) are\nour CCPs for our centrally cleared contracts.\nIn our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter\ninto agreements directly with our derivative\ncounterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements, where applicable, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. We exchange collateral in\ntwo primary forms: variation margin, which\nmitigates the risk of changes in value due to\ndaily market movements and is exchanged daily,\nand initial margin, which mitigates the risk\nof potential future exposure of a derivative\nand is exchanged at the outset of a\ntransaction and adjusted daily. We exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin on our\ncleared derivatives. For uncleared bilateral\nderivatives, we exchange variation margin and\ninitial margin on any new trades executed\nafter September 1, 2021, where such trades are\nin scope for initial margin.\n\nThe amount of collateral exchanged for\nvariation margin is dependent upon the fair\nvalue of the derivative instruments as well as\nthe fair value of the pledged collateral and\nwill vary over time as market variables\nchange. The amount of the initial margin\nexchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation\nof initial margin exposure, as prescribed by\n1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators\u2019 margin\nrules for uncleared derivatives (\u201cPR Rules\u201d)\nor 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and\n2) the fair value of the pledged collateral;\nit will vary over time as market variables\nchange. When valuing collateral, an estimate\nof the variation in price and liquidity over\ntime is subtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d\nto discount the value of the collateral\npledged. Our exposure to derivative\ncounterparty credit risk, at any point in\ntime, is equal to the amount reported as a\nderivative asset on our balance sheet. The\nfair value of our derivatives is adjusted on\nan aggregate basis to take into consideration\nthe effects of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and any associated\ncollateral received or pledged. See Table 9.3\nfor our net exposure associated with\nderivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. We also clear exchange-traded\ninstruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures\ncommission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the\nintermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require\nthat we post initial and variation margin\nthrough our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-\npayment or default. Initial margin is required\nby CCPs as collateral against potential losses\non our exchange-traded and cleared derivative\ncontracts and variation margin is exchanged on\na daily basis to account for mark-to-market\nchanges in those derivative contracts. For\nCME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives,\nvariation margin cash payments are required to\nbe characterized as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with bilateral derivative\ncounterparties, where applicable, to mitigate\nthe risk of default. These bilateral\nagreements typically provide the right to\noffset exposure with the same counterparty and\nrequire the party in a net liability position\nto post collateral. Agreements with certain\nbilateral counterparties require both parties\nto maintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of uncleared derivatives exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\n                                              \n  166    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty.

This amount will\noffset the cash flows associated with hedged\nforecasted transactions. The maximum length of\ntime over which forecasted transactions were\nhedged was approximately 9.2years as of\nDecember 31, 2022. The amount we expect to\nreclassify into earnings may change as a\nresult of changes in market conditions and\nongoing actions taken as part of our overall\nrisk management strategy.\n                                              \n  172    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFree-Standing Derivatives\nThe net impacts to our consolidated statements\nof income related to free-standing derivatives\nare presented below for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Adequacy\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to\nregulatory capital requirements established by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d),\nrespectively (\u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d). The\nBasel III Capital Rules implement certain\ncapital requirements published by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel\nCommittee\u201d), along with certain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProduction Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and\nother capital provisions.\nAs a bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nbut less than $700 billion and not exceeding\nany of the applicable risk-based thresholds,\nthe Company is a Category III institution\nunder the Basel III Capital Rules.\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III\ninstitution, is a Category III bank. Moreover,\nthe Bank, as an insured depository\ninstitution, is subject to prompt corrective\naction (\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations.\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the standardized\napproach capital conservation buffer\nrequirement, which includes the stress capital\nbuffer requirement, any global systematically\nimportant banks (\u201cG-SIB\u201d) surcharge (which is\nnot applicable to us) and the countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirement (which is currently\nset at 0%). Our stress capital buffer\nrequirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 is\n3.1%. Our capital and leverage ratios are\ncalculated based on the Basel III standardized\napproach framework.\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of\nAOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted\nfor a Category III institution.\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (collectively,\n\u201cFederal Banking Agencies\u201d) adopted a final\nrule (\u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that provides\nbanking institutions an optional five-year\ntransition period to phase in the impact of\nthe CECL standard on their regulatory\ncapital(the \u201cCECL Transition Election\u201d). We\nadopted the CECL standard (for accounting\npurposes) as of January 1, 2020, and made the\nCECL Transition Election (for regulatory\ncapital purposes) in the first quarter of\n2020. Therefore, the applicable amounts\npresented in this Report reflect such\nelection.\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year. The\nfollowing table summarizes the capital impact\ndelay and phase in period on our regulatory\ncapital from years 2020 to 2025.\n                                              \n        Ca\u2026           P\u2026                      \n        Im\u2026           In                      \n        De\u2026           P\u2026                      \n        20\u2026    20\u2026    2\u2026    20\u2026    2\u2026    20\u2026  \n  \u201c\u2026    Ca\u2026                                   \n  1\u201d    im\u2026           2\u2026    50%    7\u2026    Fu\u2026  \n  C\u2026    de\u2026           P\u2026    Ph\u2026    P\u2026    Ph\u2026  \n  a\u2026     to           In     In    In     In  \n  i\u2026    20\u2026                                   \n        25%                                   \n        sc\u2026                                   \n        fa\u2026                                   \n         as                                   \n  C\u2026     an                                   \n  \u201c\u2026    ap\u2026                                   \n  2\u201d     of                                   \n  o\u2026    the                                   \n  i\u2026    in\u2026                                   \n         in                                   \n        al\u2026                                   \n        un\u2026                                   \n        CE\u2026                                   \n                                              \nAs of December 31, 2021, we added back an\naggregate amount of $ 2.4billion to our\nregulatory capital pursuant to the CECL\nTransition Rule.

As of December 31,\n2022, under the Amended and Restated 2004\nStock Incentive plan (\u201c2004 Plan\u201d), we are\nauthorized to issue 67million common shares in\nvarious forms, primarily share-settled RSUs,\nperformance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), and non-\nqualified stock options. Of this amount,\napproximately 13million shares remain\navailable for future issuance as of December\n31, 2022. The 2004 Plan permits the use of\nnewly issued shares or treasury shares upon\nthe settlement of options and stock-based\nincentive awards, and we generally settle by\nissuing new shares.\nWe also issue cash-settled restricted stock\nunits. These cash-settled units are not\ncounted against the common shares authorized\nfor issuance or available for issuance under\nthe 2004 Plan. Cash-settled units vesting\nduring 2022, 2021 and 2020 resulted in cash\npayments to associates of $ 8million, $\n7million and $ 12million, respectively. There\nwas no unrecognized compensation cost for\nunvested cash-settled units as of December 31,\n2022.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\nrecognized during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n314million, $ 331million and $ 203million,\nrespectively. The total income tax benefit for\nstock-based compensation recognized during\n2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 75million, $\n62million and $ 43million, respectively.\nIn addition, we maintain an Associate Stock\nPurchase Plan (\u201cPurchase Plan\u201d), which is a\ncompensatory plan under the accounting\nguidance for stock-based compensation. Related\nto the Purchase Plan, we recognized\ncompensation expense of $ 36million, $\n33million and $ 30million for 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively. We also maintain a\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan,\nwhich allows participating stockholders to\npurchase additional shares of our common stock\nthrough automatic reinvestment of dividends or\noptional cash investments.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Share\nUnits\nRSUs represent share-settled awards that do\nnot contain performance conditions and are\ngranted to certain employees at no cost to the\nrecipient. RSUs generally vest over three\nyearsfrom the date of grant; however, some\nRSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the first\nor third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs\nare subject to forfeiture until certain\nrestrictions have lapsed, including continued\nemployment for a specified period of time.\nPSUs represent share-settled awards that\ncontain performance conditions and are granted\nto certain employees at no cost to the\nrecipient. PSUs generally vest over three\nyearsfrom the date of grant; however, some\nPSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the third\nanniversary of the grant date. The number of\nPSUs that step vest over three yearscan be\nreduced by 50% or 100% depending on whether\nspecific performance goals are met during the\nvesting period. The number of three-yearcliff\nvesting PSUs that will ultimately vest is\ncontingent upon meeting specific performance\ngoals over a three-yearperiod. These PSUs also\ninclude an opportunity to receive from 0% to\n150% of the target number of common shares.\nA recipient of an RSU or PSU is entitled to\nreceive a share of common stock after the\napplicable restrictions lapse and is generally\nentitled to receive cash payments or\nadditional shares of common stock equivalent\nto any dividends paid on the underlying common\nstock during the period the RSU or PSU is\noutstanding, but is not entitled to voting\nrights. Generally, the value of RSUs and PSUs\nwill equal the fair value of our common stock\non the date of grant and the expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period. Certain\nPSUs have discretionary vesting conditions and\nare remeasured at fair value each reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  180    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe following table presents a summary of 2022\nactivity for RSUs and PSUs.\nTable 13.1: Summary of Restricted Stock Units\nand Performance Share Units\n                                              \n                    Wei\u2026               Weig\u2026  \n                    Gra\u2026               Grant  \n                    Date                Date  \n         Res\u2026       Fair    Per\u2026        Fair  \n  (S\u2026    Sto\u2026       Val\u2026    Sha\u2026       Value  \n  in     Uni\u2026        per    Uni\u2026         per  \n  th\u2026    Uni\u2026       Unit    Uni\u2026        Unit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Un\u2026                                         \n  as                                          \n  of     4,1\u2026    $  104\u2026    1,7\u2026    $  102.\u2026  \n  Ja\u2026                                         \n  1,                                          \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Gr\u2026    2,9\u2026       141\u2026     870       139.\u2026  \n  Ve\u2026    -1,\u2026       103\u2026    -888       93.37  \n  Fo\u2026    -345       132\u2026     -44       129.\u2026  \n  Un\u2026                                         \n  as                                          \n  of     5,0\u2026    $  124\u2026    1,7\u2026    $  125.\u2026  \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,                                         \n  20\u2026                                         \n                                              \n_________\n(1) Granted and vested include adjustments for\nachievement of specific performance goals for\nperformance share units granted in prior\nperiods.\n(2) The weighted-average grant date fair value\nof RSUs was $ 127.37and $ 92.04in 2021 and\n2020, respectively.

Investment\nstrategies and asset allocations are based on\ncareful consideration of plan liabilities, the\nplan\u2019s funded status and our financial\ncondition. Investment performance and asset\nallocation are measured and monitored on a\ndaily basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our plan\nassets totaled $ 227million and $ 279million,\nrespectively. We invested substantially all\nour plan assets in common collective trusts,\nwhich primarily consist of domestic and\ninternational equity securities, government\nsecurities and corporate and municipal bonds.\nOur plan assets were classified as Level 2 in\nthe fair value hierarchy as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021.

We record valuation allowances to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. We\nrecord the effect of remeasuring deferred tax\nassets and liabilities due to a change in tax\nrates or laws as a component of income tax\nexpense related to continuing operations for\nthe period in which the change is enacted. We\nsubsequently release income tax effects\nstranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach.\nIncome tax benefits are recognized when, based\non their technical merits, they are more\nlikely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination. The amount recognized is the\nlargest amount of benefit that is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement.\nThe following table presents significant\ncomponents of the provision for income taxes\nattributable to continuing operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 15.1: Significant Components of the\nProvision for Income Taxes Attributable to\nContinuing Operations\n                                              \n                Year                          \n               Ended                          \n  (Dol\u2026       Decem\u2026                          \n  in             31,                          \n  mill\u2026         2022        2021        2020  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Curr\u2026                                       \n  inco\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026    $   2,125    $  2,173    $  1,676  \n  taxes                                       \n  State          423         485         370  \n  taxes                                       \n  Inte\u2026          104         152          67  \n  taxes                                       \n  Total                                       \n  curr\u2026    $   2,652    $  2,810    $  2,113  \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  Defe\u2026                                       \n  inco\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  (ben\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026    $    -662    $    490    $  -1,3\u2026  \n  taxes                                       \n  State         -112          91        -266  \n  taxes                                       \n  Inte\u2026            2          24          -4  \n  taxes                                       \n  Total                                       \n  defe\u2026         -772         605       -1,6\u2026  \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  (ben\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  inco\u2026    $   1,880    $  3,415    $    486  \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n                                              \nThe international income tax provision is\nrelated to pre-tax earnings from foreign\noperations of approximately $ 462million, $\n677million and $ 293million in 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\nTotal income tax provision does not reflect\nthe tax effects of items that are included in\nAOCI, which include a tax benefit of $\n3.2billion and $ 985million in 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, and tax provision of $\n702million in 2020.

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nWe consider all available information,\nincluding observable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and\nsignificant inputs. Based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or\ninstrument category, judgments are made\nregarding the significance of the observable\nor unobservable inputs to the instruments\u2019\nfair value measurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. The\naccounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following describes the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThe determination of the leveling of financial\ninstruments in the fair value hierarchy is\nperformed at the end of each reporting period.\nInvestment Securities\nWe measure the fair value of our U.S. Treasury\nsecurities using quoted prices in active\nmarkets. For the majority of securities in\nother investment categories, we utilize\nmultiple vendor pricing services to obtain\nfair value measurements. We use a waterfall of\npricing vendors determined using our annual\nassessment of pricing service performance. A\npricing service may be considered as the\npreferred or primary pricing provider\ndepending on how closely aligned its prices\nare to other vendor prices, and how consistent\nthe prices are with other available market\ninformation. The price of each security is\nconfirmed by comparing such price to other\nvendor prices before it is finalized.\nRMBS and CMBS are generally classified as\nLevel 2 or 3. When significant assumptions are\nnot consistently observable, fair values are\nderived using the best available data. Such\ndata may include quotes provided by dealers,\nvaluation from external pricing services,\nindependent pricing models, or other model-\nbased valuation techniques, for example,\ncalculation of the present values of future\ncash flows incorporating assumptions such as\nbenchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds,\ncredit ratings and losses. Generally, the\nexternal pricing services utilize observable\nmarket data to the extent available. Pricing\nmodels may be used, which can vary by asset\nclass, and may also incorporate available\ntrade, bid and other market information.\nAcross asset classes, information such as\ntrader/dealer inputs, credit spreads, forward\ncurves and prepayment speeds are used to help\ndetermine appropriate valuations. Because many\nfixed income securities do not trade on a\ndaily basis, the pricing models may apply\navailable information through processes such\nas benchmarking curves, grouping securities\nbased on their characteristics and using\nmatrix pricing to prepare valuations. In\naddition, model processes are used by the\npricing services to develop prepayment\nassumptions.\n                                              \n  188    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWe validate the pricing obtained from the\nprimary pricing providers through comparison\nof pricing to additional sources, including\nother pricing services, dealer pricing\nindications in transaction results and other\ninternal sources. Pricing variances among\ndifferent pricing sources are analyzed.\nAdditionally, on an on-going basis, we request\nmore detailed information from the valuation\nvendors to understand the pricing methodology\nand assumptions used to value the securities.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nWe use both exchange-traded and OTC\nderivatives to manage our interest rate,\nforeign currency and commodity risk exposures.\nWhen quoted market prices are available and\nused to value our exchange-traded derivatives,\nwe classify them as Level 1. However, the\nmajority of our derivatives do not have\nreadily available quoted market prices.\nTherefore, we value most of our derivatives\nusing vendor-based models. We primarily rely\non market observable inputs for these models,\nincluding, for example, interest rate yield\ncurves, credit curves, option volatility and\ncurrency rates. These inputs can vary\ndepending on the type of derivatives and\nnature of the underlying rate, price or index\nupon which the value of the derivative is\nbased. We typically classify derivatives as\nLevel 2 when significant inputs can be\nobserved in a liquid market and the model\nitself does not require significant judgment.\nWhen instruments are traded in less liquid\nmarkets and significant inputs are\nunobservable, such as interest rate swaps\nwhose remaining terms do not correlate with\nmarket observable interest rate yield curves,\nsuch derivatives are classified as Level 3. We\nconsider the impact of credit risk valuation\nadjustments when measuring the fair value of\nderivative contracts in order to reflect the\ncredit quality of the counterparty and our own\ncredit quality. Our internal pricing is\ncompared against additional pricing sources\nsuch as external valuation agents and other\ninternal sources. Pricing variances among\ndifferent pricing sources are analyzed and\nvalidated. These derivatives are included in\nother assets or other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nLoans Held for Sale\nIn our commercial business, we originate\nmultifamily commercial real estate loans with\nthe intent to sell them to GSEs. We elect the\nfair value option for such loans as part of\nour management of interest rate risk in our\nmultifamily agency business. These held for\nsale loans are valued based on market\nobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nas Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses on\nthese loans are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nRetained Interests in Securitizations\nWe have retained interests in various mortgage\nsecuritizations from previous acquisitions.\nOur retained interests primarily include\ninterest-only bonds and negative amortization\nbonds. We record these retained interests at\nfair value using market indications and\nvaluation models to calculate the present\nvalue of future cash flows. Due to the use of\nsignificant unobservable inputs such as\nprepayment and discount rate assumptions,\nretained interests in securitizations are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Assets\nWe offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan to eligible associates. In\naddition to participant deferrals, we make\ncontributions to the plan. Participants invest\nthese contributions in a variety of publicly\ntraded mutual funds. The plan assets, which\nconsist of publicly traded mutual funds, are\nclassified as Level 1.\n                                              \n  189    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe following table displays our assets and\nliabilities measured on our consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nTable 16.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       3       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       9      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       6       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents balance sheet netting of\nderivative assets and liabilities, and related\npayables and receivables for cash collateral\nheld or placed with the same counterparty.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity or\ncredit spreads, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. In\naddition, an increase in default rates would\ngenerally be accompanied by a decrease in\nrecovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an\nincrease in liquidity spreads, and would lead\nto a decrease in the fair value measurement.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasureme nts\n\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

instruments.\n\n(2) Due to the nature of the various mortgage\nsecuritization structures in which we have\nretained interests, it is not meaningful to\npresent a consolidated weighted average for\nthe significant unobservable inputs.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe are required to measure and recognize\ncertain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThese assets are not measured at fair value on\nan ongoing basis but are subject to fair value\nadjustments in certain circumstances (for\nexample, from the application of lower of cost\nor fair value accounting or when we evaluate\nfor impairment). The following describes the\nvaluation techniques used in estimating the\nfair value of our financial assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis.\nNet Loans Held for Investment\nLoans held for investment that are recorded at\nfair value on our consolidated balance sheets\non a nonrecurring basis largely consist of\nimpaired loans for which impairment is\nmeasured based upon the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral. The fair value is\ndetermined using appraisal values that are\nobtained from independent appraisers, broker\npricing opinions or other available market\ninformation, adjusted for the estimated cost\nto sell. Due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs, these\n                                              \n  193    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nloans are classified as Level 3 under the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for\nindividually impaired collateralized loans\nheld for investment are recorded in provision\nfor credit losses in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale for which we have not\nelected the fair value option are carried at\nthe lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred\nfees and deferred origination costs, or fair\nvalue. These loans held for sale are valued\nbased on market observable inputs and are\ntherefore classified as Level 2. Fair value\nadjustments to these loans are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income.\nOther Assets\nOther assets subject to nonrecurring fair\nvalue measurements include equity investments\naccounted for under the measurement\nalternative, other repossessed assets and\nlong-lived assets held for sale. The assets\nheld for sale are carried at the lower of the\ncarrying amount or fair value less costs to\nsell. The fair value is determined based on\nthe appraisal value, listing price of the\nproperty or collateral provided by independent\nappraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated\ncosts to sell. Due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs, these assets are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy. Fair value adjustments for these\nassets are recorded in other non-interest\nexpense in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe following table presents the carrying\nvalue of the assets measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and still held as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and for which a\nnonrecurring fair value measurement was\nrecorded during the year then ended.\nTable 16.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value\nMeasurements\n                                              \n              Dece\u2026                           \n                31,                           \n               2022                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n              Esti\u2026                           \n               Fair                    Total  \n              Value                           \n              Hier\u2026                           \n  (Dol\u2026       Level        Level              \n  in              2            3              \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held     $      0    $     284    $    284  \n  for                                         \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held           11            0          11  \n  for                                         \n  sale                                        \n  Other           0          220         220  \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total    $     11    $     504    $    515  \n                                              \n                                              \n              Dece\u2026                           \n                31,                           \n               2021                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n              Esti\u2026                           \n               Fair                    Total  \n              Value                           \n              Hier\u2026                           \n  (Dol\u2026       Level        Level              \n  in              2            3              \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held     $      0    $     194    $    194  \n  for                                         \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held          118            0         118  \n  for                                         \n  sale                                        \n  Other           0          325         325  \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total    $    118    $     519    $    637  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) As of December 31, 2022, other assets\nincluded investments accounted for under\nmeasurement alternative of $ 4million, cost\nmethod investments of $ 3million, repossessed\nassets of $ 55million and long-lived assets\nheld for sale and right-of-use assets totaling\n$ 158million.

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments.

Our customers typically include\ncompanies with annual revenues between $\n20million and $ 2billion.\n\u2022 Other category: Includes the residual impact\nof the allocation of our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group activities, such as management\nof our corporate investment portfolio,\nasset/liability management and oversight of\nour funds transfer pricing process, to our\nbusiness segments. Accordingly, net gains and\nlosses on our investment securities portfolio\nand certain trading activities are included in\nthe Other category. Other category also\nincludes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on\nforeign currency-denominated transactions;\nunallocated corporate expenses that do not\ndirectly support the operations of the\nbusiness segments or for which the business\nsegments are not considered financially\naccountable in evaluating their performance,\nsuch as certain restructuring charges; certain\nmaterial items that are non-recurring in\nnature; offsets related to certain line-item\nreclassifications; and residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess managed by our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation is unique to\neach business segment and acquired business\nand is based on the composition of assets and\nliabilities. The funds transfer pricing\nprocess considers the interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics of assets and\nliabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically the methodology and assumptions\nutilized in the funds transfer pricing process\nare adjusted to reflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the\nbusiness segments. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate market rate. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.\nThe following is additional information on the\nprinciples and methodologies used in preparing\nour business segment results.\n\u2022 Net interest income: Interest income from\nloans held for investment and interest expense\nfrom deposits and other interest-bearing\nliabilities are reflected within each\napplicable business segment.

We allocate certain non-interest\nexpenses indirectly incurred by business\nsegments, such as corporate support functions,\nto each business segment based on various\nfactors, including the actual cost of the\nservices from the service providers, the\nutilization of the services, the number of\nemployees or other relevant factors.\n\n\u2022 Goodwill and other intangible assets:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are\nassigned to one or more segments at\nacquisition. Intangible amortization is\nincluded in the results of the applicable\nsegment.\n\n\u2022 Income taxes: Income taxes are assessed for\neach business segment based on a standard tax\nrate with the residual tax expense or benefit\nto arrive at the consolidated effective tax\nrate included in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Loans held for investment: Loans are\nreported within each business segment based on\nproduct or customer type served by that\nbusiness segment.\n\n\u2022 Deposits: Deposits are reported within each\nbusiness segment based on product or customer\ntype served by that business segment.\nSegment Results and Reconciliation\nWe may periodically change our business\nsegments or reclassify business segment\nresults based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies or changes\nin organizational alignment.

or\nother tax benefits. Accordingly, we present\nour Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a\ntaxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the\nfederal statutory tax rate of 21% and state\ntaxes where applicable, with offsetting\nreductions to the Other category.\n\n(2) Total net revenue was reduced by $\n946million, $ 629million and $ 1.1billion for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively, for credit card finance\ncharges and fees charged off as uncollectible.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe majority of our revenue from contracts\nwith customers consists of interchange fees,\nservice charges and other customer-related\nfees, and other contract revenue. Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as automated teller\nmachine (\u201cATM\u201d) usage. Service charges and\nother customer-related fees within our\nCommercial Banking business are mostly related\nto fees earned on treasury management and\ncapital markets services.

The contractual\namount of these commitments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to us should the\ncounterparty draw upon the commitment. We\ngenerally manage the potential risk of\nunfunded lending commitments by limiting the\ntotal amount of arrangements, monitoring the\nsize and maturity structure of these\nportfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021. The carrying value represents our\nreserve and deferred revenue on legally\nbinding commitments.\nTable 18.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments\n                                              \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n  \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026          N\u2026          N\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Includes $ 4.4billion and $ 3.9billion of\nadvised lines of credit as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(2) These financial guarantees have expiration\ndates that range from 2022 to 2027 as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nLoss Sharing Agreements\nWithin our Commercial Banking business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans with the intent to sell them to the\nGSEs.

Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2022 are approximately $\n200million. Our reserve and reasonably\npossible loss estimates involve considerable\njudgment and reflect that there is still\nsignificant uncertainty regarding numerous\nfactors that may impact the ultimate loss\nlevels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlitigation matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and the range of reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed here. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in these matters,\nespecially those involving governmental\nagencies, and the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these matters, there\nis significant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these litigation\nmatters and an adverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be material to our\nresults of operations or cash flows for any\nparticular reporting period.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds settlements for its member\nbanks, and any settlements related to\nMasterCard-allocated losses have either\nalready been paid or are reflected in our\nreserves.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we\nare subject to numerous legal proceedings and\nother inquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We were named as a\ndefendant in approximately 75putative consumer\nclass action cases (primarily in U.S. courts\nwith cases also in Canadian courts) alleging\nharm from the Cybersecurity Incident and\nseeking various remedies, including monetary\nand injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege\nbreach of contract, negligence, violations of\nvarious privacy laws and a variety of other\nlegal causes of action. The U.S. consumer\nclass actions were consolidated for pretrial\nproceedings before a multi-district litigation\n(\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria\nDivision. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the\nparties agreed to a settlement of the U.S.\nconsumer class action cases for an amount\nwithin existing reserves. The MDL court\napproved the settlement in September 2022, and\nthe approval became final in the fourth\nquarter of 2022. The balance of the settlement\nwas paid after the court approval became final\nin the fourth quarter of 2022, and the U.S.\nconsumer class action is now concluded.\nCapital One maintained cyber insurance that\ncovered this settlement. In\n                                              \n  202    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nCanada, a trial court in British Columbia\npreliminarily certified a class of all\nimpacted Canadian consumers except those in\nQuebec in the second quarter of 2022, which\nwould allow the case to proceed with discovery\non a classwide basis under Canadian law. The\npreliminary certification decision has been\nappealed.\n\nSecurities class action . The Company and\ncertain officers were also named as defendants\nin a putative class action pending in the MDL\nalleging violations of certain federal\nsecurities laws in connection with statements\nand alleged omissions in securities filings\nrelating to our information security standards\nand practices. The complaint sought\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief. The MDL court granted\nthe Company\u2019s motion to dismiss in September\n2022, and the dismissal became final in the\nfourth quarter of 2022. The securities class\naction is now concluded.\n\nGovernmental inquiries . We have received\ninquiries and requests for information\nrelating to the Cybersecurity Incident from\nCongress, federal regulators, relevant\nCanadian regulators, the Department of\nJustice, and the offices of approximately\nfourteen state Attorneys General. We have\ncooperated with these offices and responded to\ntheir inquiries.\n\nIn August 2020, we entered into consent orders\nwith the Federal Reserve and OCC resulting\nfrom regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity\nIncident and relating to ongoing enhancements\nof our cybersecurity and operational risk\nmanagement processes. We paid an $ 80million\npenalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the\nOCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement\ndid not contain a monetary penalty. The OCC\nlifted its consent order on August 31, 2022.\nU.K. PPI Litigation\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received\ncustomer complaints and regulatory claims\nrelating to PPI. COEP has materially resolved\nthe PPI complaints and regulatory claims\nreceived prior to the deadline. Some of the\nclaimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims\nprocess have subsequently initiated legal\nproceedings, seeking additional redress. We\nare responding to these proceedings as we\nreceive them.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  203    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n
