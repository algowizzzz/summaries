The following MD&A is\nprovided as a supplement to, and should be\nread in conjunction with, our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes in this\nReport and the more detailed information\ncontained in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n                \n  INTRODUCTION  \n                \nCapital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware\ncorporation established in 1994 and\nheadquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cCapital One\u201d)\noffer a broad array of financial products and\nservices to consumers, small businesses and\ncommercial clients through digital channels,\nbranch locations, caf\u00e9s and other distribution\nchannels.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, Capital One Financial\nCorporation\u2019s principal operating subsidiary\nwas Capital One, National Association\n(\u201cCONA\u201d). The Company is hereafter\ncollectively referred to as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or\n\u201cour.\u201d CONA is referred to as the \u201cBank.\u201d\n\nOur consolidated total net revenues are\nderived primarily from lending to consumer and\ncommercial customers net of funding costs\nassociated with our deposits, long-term debt\nand other borrowings. We also earn non-\ninterest income which primarily consists of\ninterchange income, net of reward expenses,\nservice charges and other customer-related\nfees. Our expenses primarily consist of the\nprovision for credit losses, operating\nexpenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customers served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking.

Holders of\nDiscover common stock will receive cash in\nlieu of fractional shares. At the effective\ntime of the Second Step Merger, each share of\nFixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative\nPerpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, of\nDiscover, and each share of 6.125% Fixed-Rate\nReset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred\nStock, Series D, of Discover, in each case\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective\ntime of the Second Step Merger, will be\nconverted into the right to receive a share of\nnewly created series of preferred stock of\nCapital One having terms that are not\nmaterially less favorable than the applicable\nseries of Discover preferred stock.

The final rule\ncurrently has an effective date of May 14,\n2024 but is subject to ongoing litigation, the\noutcome of which remains uncertain.\n\nThe final rule, when effective, will have a\nsignificant impact on our revenue. In response\nto the final rule, we have developed a number\nof mitigating actions, including changes to\nour policies, products, and investment\nchoices. Some of these mitigating actions have\nbeen implemented. Others may be implemented as\nmatters related to the final rule continue to\ndevelop. After their implementation, we\nbelieve that these actions will gradually\nresolve the impact of the final rule on our\nresults of operations over time.\nFor more information on risks related to these\nrules, see the risk factors set forth under\n\u201cPart I\u2014Item 1A.

We also provide\nselected key metrics we use in evaluating our\nperformance, including certain metrics that\nare computed using non-GAAP measures. We\nconsider these metrics to be key financial\nmeasures that management uses in assessing our\noperating performance, capital adequacy and\nthe level of returns generated. We believe\nthese non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight\nto investors and users of our financial\ninformation as they provide an alternate\nmeasurement of our performance and assist in\nassessing our capital adequacy and the level\nof return generated.

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a business segment are\nincluded in the Other category, such as the\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio and asset/liability positions\nperformed by our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group and any residual tax expense or\nbenefit beyond what is assessed to our\nbusiness segments in order to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate. The Other\ncategory also includes unallocated corporate\nexpenses that do not directly support the\noperations of the business segments or for\nwhich the business segments are not considered\nfinancially accountable in evaluating their\nperformance, such as certain restructuring\ncharges.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenues and expenses directly\nor indirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process is managed by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and provides a funds\ncredit for sources of funds, such as deposits\ngenerated by our Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking businesses, and a charge\nfor the use of funds by each segment. The\nallocation is unique to each business segment\nand acquired business and is based on the\ncomposition of assets and liabilities. The\nfunds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and\noff-balance sheet products. Periodically, the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the\nfunds transfer pricing process are adjusted to\nreflect economic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the business segments. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

The level and\ncomposition of our capital may also be\ninfluenced by rating agency guidelines,\nsubsidiary capital requirements, business\nenvironment, conditions in the financial\nmarkets and assessments of potential future\nlosses due to adverse changes in our business\nand market environments.\n                                              \n  Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective     \n  Action                                      \n                                              \nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the\nregulatory capital requirements established by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d),\nrespectively (the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d).\nThe Basel III Capital Rules implement certain\ncapital requirements published by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel\nCommittee\u201d), along with certain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and\nother capital provisions.\n\nAs a bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nbut less than $700 billion and not exceeding\nany of the applicable risk-based thresholds,\nthe Company is a Category III institution\nunder the Basel III Capital Rules.\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III\ninstitution, is a Category III bank. Moreover,\nthe Bank, as an insured depository\ninstitution, is subject to prompt corrective\naction (\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations.\n                                              \n  Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules            \n                                              \nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%,\na Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total\ncapital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in\nrelation to risk-weighted assets. In addition,\nwe must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of\n4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage\nratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the\ncapital conservation buffer requirement and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement,\neach as described below. Our capital and\nleverage ratios are calculated based on the\nBasel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of\naccumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our regulatory capital as\npermitted for a Category III institution. For\ninformation on the recognition of AOCI in\nregulatory capital under the proposed changes\nto the Basel III Capital Rules, see \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u2014Prudential Regulation of\nBanking\u2014Capital and Stress Testing\nRegulation\u2014Basel III Finalization Proposal\u201d in\nour 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe \u201cG-SIB Surcharge.\u201d We are not a G-SIB\nbased on the most recent available data and\nthus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s final rule to implement the\nstress capital buffer requirement (\u201cStress\nCapital Buffer Rule\u201d) , the Company\u2019s\n\u201cstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer\u201d includes its stress capital buffer\nrequirement (as described below), any G-SIB\nSurcharge (which is not applicable to us) and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0% ) . Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC\nand the FDIC, hereafter collectively referred\nto as the \u201cFederal Banking Agencies,\u201d set an\nearlier effective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is recalibrated every year based\non the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults. In particular, the Company\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement equals, subject to\na floor of 2.5% , the sum of (i) the\ndifference between the Company\u2019s starting CET1\ncapital ratio and its lowest projected CET1\ncapital ratio under the severely adverse\nscenario of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory\nstress test plus (ii) the ratio of the\nCompany\u2019s projected four quarters of common\nstock dividends (for the fourth to seventh\nquarters of the planning horizon) to the\nprojected risk-weighted assets for the quarter\nin which the Company\u2019s projected CET1 capital\nratio reaches its minimum under the\nsupervisory stress test.\n                                              \n  31    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2023 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is\n4.8%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 9.3%,\n10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2023 through September 30,\n2024.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC\u2019s capital\nregulations, which are only applicable to the\nBank, the capital conservation buffer for the\nBank continues to be fixed at 2.5% .\nAccordingly, the Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0% , 8.5% and\n10.5%, respectively.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain\nits capital ratios above the minimum capital\nrequirements plus the applicable capital\nconservation buffer requirements, it will face\nincreasingly strict automatic limitations on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, the Company and the Bank each\nexceeded the minimum capital requirements and\nthe capital conservation buffer requirements\napplicable to them, and the Company and the\nBank were each \u201c well-capitalized. \u201d The\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards applicable to the\nCompany are established in the Federal\nReserve\u2019s regulations, and the \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d standards applicable to the Bank\nare established in the OCC\u2019s PCA capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (the \u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that\nprovides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the current expected credit losses\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) standard on their regulatory capital\n(\u201cCECL Transition Election\u201d). We adopted the\nCECL standard (for accounting purposes) as of\nJanuary 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition\nElection (for regulatory capital purposes) in\nthe first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the\napplicable amounts presented in this Report\nreflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

Our 2024 supervisory stress test result\nwill determine the size of our stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning\nfrom October 1, 2024 through September 30,\n2025.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan rule\nprovides that if a BHC determines there has\nbeen or will be a material change in its risk\nprofile, financial condition, or corporate\nstructure since it last submitted the capital\nplan, it must update and resubmit its capital\nplan within 30 calendar days, subject to a\npotential 60-day extension. We determined that\nour proposed acquisition of Discover\nconstitutes a material change and, therefore,\nwe are required to resubmit an updated capital\nplan. The capital plan rule further provides\nthat upon the occurrence of an event requiring\nresubmission, a BHC may not make any capital\ndistribution unless it has received approval\nof the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, all our\ncapital distributions are now subject to the\nprior approval of the Federal Reserve pending\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s consideration of our\nresubmitted capital plan. We have received\nprior approval of the Federal Reserve to make\ncertain capital distributions.\n                                              \n  34    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases         \n                                              \nIn the first three months of 2024, we declared\nand paid common stock dividends of $238\nmillion, or $0.60 per share, and preferred\nstock dividends of $57 million. Pursuant to\nthe terms of the Merger Agreement, we are\nrestricted from paying quarterly cash\ndividends on our common stock in excess of\n$0.60 per share per quarter until the\nTransaction is completed or the Merger\nAgreement is terminated.\n\nThe following table summarizes the dividends\npaid per share on our various preferred stock\nseries in the first three months of 2024.\nTable 15: Preferred Stock Dividends Paid Per\nShare\n                                              \n                          Per                 \n  Se\u2026    Des\u2026    Iss\u2026    Ann\u2026    Div\u2026    20\u2026  \n                 Date    Div\u2026    Fre\u2026         \n                         Rate                 \n  Q1                                          \n  Se\u2026    5.0\u2026    Sep\u2026                         \n  I      Non\u2026    11,     5.0\u2026    Qua\u2026    $1\u2026  \n                 2019                         \n  Se\u2026    4.8\u2026    Jan\u2026                         \n  J      Non\u2026    31,     4.8\u2026    Qua\u2026    12\u2026  \n                 2020                         \n  Se\u2026    4.6\u2026    Sep\u2026                         \n  K      Non\u2026    17,     4.6\u2026    Qua\u2026    11\u2026  \n                 2020                         \n  Se\u2026    4.3\u2026    May                          \n  L      Non\u2026    4,      4.3\u2026    Qua\u2026    10\u2026  \n                 2021                         \n                         3.9\u2026                 \n                         thr\u2026                 \n                         8/3\u2026                 \n                         res\u2026                 \n                         9/1\u2026                 \n         3.9\u2026             and                 \n         Fix\u2026    June    eve\u2026                 \n  Se\u2026    Rate    10,     sub\u2026    Qua\u2026    9.\u2026  \n  M      Res\u2026    2021       5                 \n         Non\u2026            year                 \n                         ann\u2026                 \n                           at                 \n                         5-Y\u2026                 \n                         Tre\u2026                 \n                         Rate                 \n                         +3.\u2026                 \n  Se\u2026    4.2\u2026    July                         \n  N      Non\u2026    29,     4.2\u2026    Qua\u2026    10\u2026  \n                 2021                         \n                                              \nThe declaration and payment of dividends to\nour stockholders, as well as the amount\nthereof, are subject to the discretion of our\nBoard of Directors and depend upon our results\nof operations, financial condition, capital\nlevels, cash requirements, future prospects,\nregulatory requirements and other factors\ndeemed relevant by the Board of Directors.

The Bank is subject to\nregulatory restrictions that limit its ability\nto transfer funds to our BHC. As of March 31,\n2024, funds available for dividend payments\nfrom the Bank were $6.6 billion. There can be\nno assurance that we will declare and pay any\ndividends to stockholders.\n\nWe repurchased $103 million of shares of our\ncommon stock during the first quarter of 2024.\nThe timing and exact amount of any future\ncommon stock repurchases will depend on\nvarious factors, including regulatory\napproval, market conditions, opportunities for\ngrowth, our capital position and the amount of\nretained earnings. The Board authorized stock\nrepurchase program does not include specific\nprice targets, may be executed through open\nmarket purchases, tender offers, or privately\nnegotiated transactions, including utilizing\nRule 10b5-1 programs, does not have a set\nexpiration date and may be suspended at any\ntime.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023.\n                                              \n  Table 21: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            March 31,        December     \n  portfoli\u2026          2024        31, 2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater              68  %           68  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or               32              32     \n  below                                       \n  Total               100  %          100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater              53  %           53  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660            20              20     \n  620 or               27              27     \n  below                                       \n  Total               100  %          100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory. Domestic Card credit scores\ngenerally represent Fair Isaac Corporation\n(\u201cFICO\u201d) scores.

In determining\nthe risk rating of a particular loan, some of\nthe factors considered are the borrower\u2019s\ncurrent financial condition, historical and\nprojected future credit performance, prospects\nfor support from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\n\nWe present information in the section below on\nthe credit performance of our loan portfolio,\nincluding the key metrics we use in tracking\nchanges in the credit quality of our loan\nportfolio.

We\ncharge off loans as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses when we determine\nthe loan is uncollectible and record\nsubsequent recoveries of previously charged\noff amounts as increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Uncollectible finance charges\nand fees are reversed through revenue and\ncertain fraud losses are recorded in other\nnon-interest expense. Generally, costs to\nrecover charged off loans are recorded as\ncollection expenses as incurred and are\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense. Our charge-off policy for loans\nvaries based on the loan type. See \u201cPart\nII\u2014Item 8.

of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (one to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectability of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications, including FDMs, when estimating\nthe credit quality of our loan portfolio and\nestablishing allowance levels. For our\nCommercial Banking customers, loan\nmodifications are also considered in the\nassignment of an internal risk rating.\n\nIn our Credit Card business, the majority of\nour FDMs receive an interest rate reduction\nand are placed on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months. If the customer does not\ncomply with the modified payment terms, then\nthe credit card loan agreement may revert to\nits original payment terms, generally\nresulting in any loan outstanding being\nreflected in the appropriate delinquency\ncategory and charged off in accordance with\nour standard charge-off policy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our FDMs receive an extension, an interest\nrate reduction, principal reduction, or a\ncombination of these modifications.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of our FDMs receive an extension. A\nportion of FDMs receive an interest rate\nreduction, principal reduction, or a\ncombination of modifications.\nFor more information on FDMs, see \u201cItem 1.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u2014Note 4\u2014Loans.\u201d\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. We also estimate expected credit\nlosses related to unfunded lending commitments\nthat are not unconditionally cancellable. The\nprovision for losses on unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in the provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income and the related reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments is included in other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.

We are exposed to\nmarket risk primarily from the following\noperations and activities:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of deposit\ngathering and lending;\n\n\u2022 Asset/liability management activities\nincluding the management of investment\nsecurities, short-term and long-term\nborrowings and derivatives;\n\n\u2022 Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada\nwithin our Credit Card business; and\n\n\u2022 Customer accommodation activities within our\nCommercial Banking business.\n\nWe have enterprise-wide risk management\npolicies and limits, approved by our Board of\nDirectors, which govern our market risk\nmanagement activities. Our objective is to\nmanage our exposure to market risk in\naccordance with these policies and limits\nbased on prevailing market conditions and\nlong-term expectations. We provide additional\ninformation below about our primary sources of\nmarket risk, our market risk management\nstrategies and the measures that we use to\nevaluate these exposures.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Risk                          \n                                              \nInterest rate risk represents exposure to\nfinancial instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest rates. We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or repricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments which could\ninclude caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact of hypothetical\ninstantaneous movements in interest rates\nrelative to our baseline interest rate\nforecast on our projected 12-month net\ninterest income. Net interest income\nsensitivity metrics are derived using the\nfollowing key assumptions:\n\n\u2022 In addition to our existing assets,\nliabilities and derivative positions, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions. These assumptions include loan\nand deposit growth, pricing, plans for\nprojected changes in our funding mix and our\nsecurities and cash position from our internal\ncorporate outlook that is used in our\nfinancial planning process.\n\n\u2022 The analysis assumes this forecast of\nexpected future business growth remains\nunchanged between the baseline rate forecast\nand rate shock scenarios, including no changes\nto our interest rate risk management\nactivities like securities and hedging\nactions.\n\n\u2022 We incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit\nre-pricing, which includes pricing lags and\nchanges in deposit beta and mix as interest\nrates change, and the prepayment sensitivity\nof our mortgage securities to the level of\ninterest rates. In our models, deposit betas\nand mortgage security prepayments vary\ndynamically based on the level of interest\nrates and by product type. In the contexts\nused in this section, \u201cbeta\u201d refers to the\nchange in deposit rate paid relative to the\nchange in the federal funds rate.\n\n\u2022 In instances where an interest rate scenario\nwould result in a rate less than 0.00%, we\nassume a rate of 0% for that scenario.

In our models, deposit betas and\nmortgage security prepayments vary dynamically\nbased on the level of interest rates and by\nproduct type.\n\n\u2022 Balance attrition assumptions for loans,\nincluding credit card, auto and commercial\nloans, remain unchanged between the baseline\ninterest rate forecast and interest rate shock\nscenarios as those loans are mainly floating\nrate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and\nhence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the\nlevel of interest rates.\n\n\u2022 For assets and liabilities with embedded\noptionality, such as mortgage securities and\ndeposit balances, we utilize monte carlo\nsimulations to assess economic value with\nindustry-standard term structure modeling of\ninterest rates.\n\n\u2022 Our calculations of net present value apply\nappropriate spreads over the benchmark yield\ncurve for select assets and liabilities to\ncapture the inherent risks (including credit\nrisk) to discount expected interest and\nprincipal cash flows.\n\n\u2022 In instances where an interest rate scenario\nwould result in a rate less than 0.00%, we\nassume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This\nassumption applies only to jurisdictions that\ndo not have a practice of employing negative\npolicy rates. In jurisdictions that have\nnegative policy rates, we do not floor\ninterest rates at 0.00%.\n\nOur current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity decreases in higher\ninterest rate scenarios and increases in lower\ninterest rate scenarios. The decrease in\nhigher rate scenarios is due to the declines\nin the projected value of our fixed rate\nassets being only partially offset by\ncorresponding movements in the projected value\nof our deposits and other liabilities. The\npace of economic value of equity decrease is\nlarger for the +200 bps scenario as our\ndeposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly\nin higher interest rate environments. Our\ncurrent economic value of equity sensitivity\nis largely unchanged as compared to December\n31, 2023.\n                                              \n  57    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 32 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand our current economic value of equity\ncalculated under the methodology described\nabove as of March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\n                                              \n   Table 32: Interest Rate Sensitivity        \n   Analysis                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n                March 31,        December     \n                     2024        31, 2023     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  projected                                   \n  baseline                                    \n  net                                         \n  interest                                    \n  income:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis               1.2  %          0.7  %  \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis               0.9             0.8     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis           0.5             0.4     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis          -0.6            -0.5     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis              -1.2            -0.9     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis              -2.5            -2.0     \n  points                                      \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  economic                                    \n  value of                                    \n  equity:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis              -8.4            -8.4     \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis              -3.7            -3.7     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis          -1.8            -1.8     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis           1.7             1.6     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis               3.2             2.9     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis               4.9             4.0     \n  points                                      \n                                              \nIn addition to these industry standard\nmeasures, we also consider the potential\nimpact of alternative interest rate scenarios,\nsuch as larger rate shocks, higher than +/-\n200 bps, as well as steepening and flattening\nyield curve scenarios in our internal interest\nrate risk management decisions. We also\nregularly review the sensitivity of our\ninterest rate risk metrics to changes in our\nkey modeling assumptions, such as our loan and\ndeposit balance forecasts, mortgage\nprepayments and deposit repricing.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments. Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on our existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.

We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nnominal intercompany funding outstanding was\n987 million GBP and 973 million GBP as of\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, and 1.6 billion CAD as of both\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our\nnominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding\nwere 1.3 billion EUR as of both March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023.\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet and\ncapital ratios to translation risk in AOCI. We\nmanage our translation risk by entering into\nforeign currency derivatives designated as net\ninvestment hedges. We measure these exposures\nby applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation\nshock, which we believe approximates a\nsignificant adverse shock over a one-year time\nhorizon, against the value of the equity\ninvested in our foreign operations net of\nrelated net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 2.2 billion\nGBP as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, and 2.4 billion CAD as of both March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.

We present our auto\nloan portfolio by Fair Isaac Corporation\n(\u201cFICO\u201d) scores at origination and our retail\nbanking loan portfolio by delinquency status,\nwhich includes all past due loans, both\nperforming and nonperforming.\nTable 4.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by\nVintage Year\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  88    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Amounts represent period-end loans held\nfor investment in each credit score category.\nAuto credit scores generally represent average\nFICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus\nat the time of application and are not\nrefreshed thereafter.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses. Generally, loans that are\ndesignated as criticized performing and\ncriticized nonperforming are reviewed\nquarterly by management to determine if they\nare appropriately classified/rated and whether\nany impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are\nalso generally reviewed, at least annually, to\ndetermine the appropriate risk rating. In\naddition, we evaluate the risk rating during\nthe renewal process of any loan or if a loan\nbecomes past due.\n\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of March 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023. The internal risk\nrating status includes all past due loans,\nboth performing and nonperforming.\nTable 4.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by\nInternal Risk Ratings\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  90    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Criticized exposures correspond to the\n\u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d and\n\u201cDoubtful\u201d asset categories defined by bank\nregulatory authorities.\n                                              \n  91    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nFinancial Difficulty Modifications to\nBorrowers\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (one to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectability of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications when estimating the credit\nquality of our loan portfolio and establishing\nallowance levels.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. Significant judgment is applied in\nour estimation of lifetime credit losses. When\ndeveloping an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information, or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Our estimate of\nexpected credit losses includes a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period of one year\nand then reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses at each relevant loss\ncomponent of the estimate. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions in net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which provide a source of funding for\nus and enable us to transfer a certain portion\nof the economic risk of the loans or related\ndebt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet the maximum amount of any remaining\nfunding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We\nseparately present information for\nconsolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 6.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       23       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       10       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       33       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  100    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       23       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       10       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       33       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities of the VIE, which includes the\nseller\u2019s interest and repurchased notes held\nby other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.6billion of assets and $\n984million of liabilities as of March 31,\n2024, and $ 2.6billion of assets and $\n989million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2023.\n\n(4) Primarily consists of variable interests\nin companies that promote renewable energy\nsources and other equity method investments.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to government-\nsponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service\nthe transferred loans pursuant to the\nguidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an\ninvestor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and\nABS in our investment securities portfolio,\nwhich represent variable interests in the\nrespective securitization trusts from which\nthose securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either solely invest in securities\nissued by the VIE and were not involved in the\ndesign of the VIE or no transfers have\noccurred between the VIE and ourselves.

Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritizations involve the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties, a\nmajority of which are VIEs. We receive\naffordable housing tax credits for these\ninvestments. The activities of these entities\nare financed with a combination of invested\nequity capital and debt. We account for our\ninvestments in qualified affordable housing\nprojects using the proportional amortization\nmethod, where costs of the investment are\namortized over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the three months ended March\n31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized amortization\nof $ 178million and $ 170million,\nrespectively, and tax credits of $ 184million\nand $ 177million, respectively, associated\nwith these investments within income tax\nprovision. The carrying value of our equity\ninvestments in these qualified affordable\nhousing projects was $ 5.3billion and $\n5.5billion as of March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively. We are periodically\nrequired to provide additional financial or\nother support during the period of the\ninvestments. Our liability for these unfunded\ncommitments was $ 2.2billion and $ 2.3billion\nas of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, and is largely expected to be\npaid from 2024 to 2027.\n                                              \n  102    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n5.6billion and $ 5.7billion as of March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The\ncreditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit and we do not provide\nadditional financial or other support other\nthan during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n18.8billion and $ 18.6billion as of March 31,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.9billion and $ 2.5billion as\nof March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, are reflected on our\nconsolidated balance sheets in cash, loans\nheld for investment, and other assets. The\nliabilities are reflected in other\nliabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no\nrecourse to our general credit. We have not\nprovided additional financial or other support\nother than during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it.\n\nOther\n\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We are not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance. Our maximum exposure to these\nVIEs is limited to the investments on our\nconsolidated balance sheets of $ 411million\nand $ 449million as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. The creditors\nof the other VIEs have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit.

Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging certain exposures denominated in\nforeign currencies. We primarily use interest\nrate and foreign currency swaps to perform\nthese hedging activities, but we may also use\na variety of other derivative instruments,\nincluding caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts, to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks. We designate these\nrisk management derivatives as either\nqualifying accounting hedges or free-standing\nderivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are\nfurther designated as fair value hedges, cash\nflow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-\nstanding derivatives are economic hedges that\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We offset the\nsubstantial majority of the market risk\nexposure of our customer accommodation\nderivatives through derivative transactions\nwith other counterparties.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. We enter into receive-fixed, pay-float\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed rate debt and\ndeposits due to fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed,\nreceive-float interest rate swaps to hedge\nchanges in the fair value of fixed rate\ninvestment securities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the hedged forecasted\ntransactions impact earnings and presented in\nthe same line item in our consolidated\nstatements of income as the earnings effect of\nthe hedged items. We enter into receive-fixed,\npay-float interest rate swaps and interest\nrate floors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated credit card and\ncommercial loans from floating to fixed in\norder to reduce the impact of changes in\nforecasted future cash flows due to\nfluctuations in market interest rates. We also\nenter into foreign currency forward contracts\nto hedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  107    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that stems from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in \u201cover-the-\ncounter\u201d (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the\nIntercontinental Exchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH\nGroup (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs for our centrally\ncleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral\ncontracts, we enter into agreements directly\nwith our derivative counterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements, where applicable, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. We exchange collateral in\ntwo primary forms: variation margin, which\nmitigates the risk of changes in value due to\ndaily market movements and is exchanged daily,\nand initial margin, which mitigates the risk\nof potential future exposure of a derivative\nand is exchanged at the outset of a\ntransaction and adjusted daily. We exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin on our\ncleared derivatives. For uncleared bilateral\nderivatives executed after September 1, 2021\nand in scope for initial margin, we exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin.\n\nThe amount of collateral exchanged for\nvariation margin is dependent upon the fair\nvalue of the derivative instruments as well as\nthe fair value of the pledged collateral and\nwill vary over time as market variables\nchange. The amount of the initial margin\nexchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation\nof initial margin exposure, as prescribed by\n1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators\u2019 margin\nrules for uncleared derivatives (\u201cPR Rules\u201d)\nor 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and\n2) the fair value of the pledged collateral;\nit will vary over time as market variables\nchange. When valuing collateral, an estimate\nof the variation in price and liquidity over\ntime is subtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d\nto discount the value of the collateral\npledged. Our exposure to derivative\ncounterparty credit risk, at any point in\ntime, is equal to the amount reported as a\nderivative asset on our balance sheet. The\nfair value of our derivatives is adjusted on\nan aggregate basis to take into consideration\nthe effects of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and any associated\ncollateral received or pledged. See Table 9.3\nfor our net exposure associated with\nderivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. We also clear exchange-traded\ninstruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures\ncommission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the\nintermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require\nthat we post initial and variation margin\nthrough our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-\npayment or default. Initial margin is required\nby CCPs as collateral against potential losses\non our exchange-traded and cleared derivative\ncontracts and variation margin is exchanged on\na daily basis to account for mark-to-market\nchanges in those derivative contracts. For\nCME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives,\nvariation margin cash payments are required to\nbe characterized as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with bilateral derivative\ncounterparties, where applicable, to mitigate\nthe risk of default. These bilateral\nagreements typically provide the right to\noffset exposure with the same counterparty and\nrequire the party in a net liability position\nto post collateral. Agreements with certain\nbilateral counterparties require both parties\nto maintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of uncleared derivatives exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\n                                              \n  108    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty. We also\nrecord debit valuation adjustments (\u201cDVAs\u201d) to\nadjust the fair values of our derivative\nliabilities to reflect the impact of our own\ncredit quality.\n\nBalance Sheet Presentation\nThe following table summarizes the notional\namounts and fair values of our derivative\ninstruments as of March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, which are segregated by derivatives\nthat are designated as accounting hedges and\nthose that are not, and are further segregated\nby type of contract within those two\ncategories. The total derivative assets and\nliabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis\nto take into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand any associated cash collateral received or\npledged. Derivative assets and liabilities are\nincluded in other assets and other\nliabilities, respectively, on our consolidated\nbalance sheets, and their related gains or\nlosses are included in operating activities as\nchanges in other assets and other liabilities\nin the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTable 9.1: Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nat Fair Value\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n             $      $             $      $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Does not reflect $ 1million and $ 2million\nrecognized as a net valuation allowance on\nderivative assets and liabilities for non-\nperformance risk as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n              observable in the market.       \n  Level\u00a03:    Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d)               \n              methodologies or similar        \n              techniques.                     \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nWe consider all available information,\nincluding observable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and\nsignificant inputs. Based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or\ninstrument category, judgments are made\nregarding the significance of the observable\nor unobservable inputs to the instruments\u2019\nfair value measurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. The\naccounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity or\ncredit spreads, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. In\naddition, an increase in default rates would\ngenerally be accompanied by a decrease in\nrecovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an\nincrease in liquidity spreads, and would lead\nto a decrease in the fair value measurement.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasureme nts\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a business segment are included in the\nOther category, such as the management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio and\nasset/liability positions performed by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and any\nresidual tax expense or benefit beyond what is\nassessed to our business segments in order to\narrive at the consolidated effective tax rate.\nThe Other category also includes unallocated\ncorporate expenses that do not directly\nsupport the operations of the business\nsegments or for which the business segments\nare not considered financially accountable in\nevaluating their performance, such as certain\nrestructuring charges.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenues and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess managed by our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation is unique to\neach business segment and acquired business\nand is based on the composition of assets and\nliabilities. The funds transfer pricing\nprocess considers the interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics of assets and\nliabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically the methodology and assumptions\nutilized in the funds transfer pricing process\nare adjusted to reflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the\nbusiness segments. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate market rates. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.

Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as automated teller\nmachine (\u201cATM\u201d) usage. Service charges and\nother customer-related fees within our\nCommercial Banking business are mostly related\nto fees earned on treasury management and\ncapital markets services. Other contract\nrevenue in our Credit Card business consists\nprimarily of revenue from our partnership\narrangements. Other contract revenue in our\nConsumer Banking business consists primarily\nof revenue earned from services provided to\nauto industry participants. Revenue from\ncontracts with customers is included in non-\ninterest income in our consolidated statements\nof income.\nThe following table presents revenue from\ncontracts with customers and a reconciliation\nto non-interest income by business segment for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2024 and\n2023.\nTable 13.2: Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers and Reconciliation to Segment\nResults\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  98    $  \u2026    $   0    $  \u2026  \n         0        4       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       44       2        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       13       \u2026       -2       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -2    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  86    $  \u2026    $   1    $  \u2026  \n         0       21       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         \u2026       19       5        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026        9       \u2026        7       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $   7    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Some of our commercial investments\ngenerate tax-exempt income, tax credits or\nother tax benefits.

The contractual\namount of these commitments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to us should the\ncounterparty draw upon the commitment. We\ngenerally manage the potential risk of\nunfunded lending commitments by limiting the\ntotal amount of arrangements, monitoring the\nsize and maturity structure of these\nportfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.

We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of these\noriginated loans. Beginning January 1, 2020,\nwe elected the fair value option on new loss\nsharing agreements entered into. Unrealized\ngains and losses are recorded in other non-\ninterest income in our consolidated statements\nof income. For those loss sharing agreements\nentered into as of and prior to December 31,\n2019, we amortize the liability recorded at\ninception into non-interest income as we are\nreleased from risk of having to make a payment\nand record our estimate of expected credit\nlosses each period through the provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income. The liability recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheets for these loss\nsharing agreements was $ 143million and $\n137million as of March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023, respectively. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Allowance\nfor Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded\nLending Commitments\u201d for information related\nto our credit card partnership loss sharing\narrangements.\n                                              \n  129    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nLitigation\n\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for litigation related matters that\narise from the ordinary course of our business\nactivities when it is probable that a loss\nassociated with a claim or proceeding has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of March\n31, 2024 are approximately $ 200million. Our\nreserve and reasonably possible loss estimates\ninvolve considerable judgment and reflect that\nthere is still significant uncertainty\nregarding numerous factors that may impact the\nultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding, our\nattempt to estimate a reasonably possible\nrange of loss beyond our current accrual\nlevels for some litigation matters based on\ncurrent information, it is possible that\nactual future losses will exceed both the\ncurrent accrual level and the range of\nreasonably possible losses disclosed here.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties involved in\nthese matters, especially those involving\ngovernmental agencies, and the very large or\nindeterminate damages sought in some of these,\nthere is significant uncertainty as to the\nultimate liability we may incur from these\nlitigation matters and an adverse outcome in\none or more of these matters could be material\nto our results of operations or cash flows for\nany particular reporting period.\nInterchange Litigation\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. The Visa and MasterCard payment networks\nand issuing banks entered into settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement.\n\nThe monetary relief class action settled for\n$5.5 billion. The settlement received final\napproval from the District Court in December\n2019. The Second Circuit affirmed the\nsettlement in March 2023, and it is final.\nSome of the merchants that opted out of the\nmonetary relief class have brought cases, and\nsome of those cases have settled and some\nremain pending. Visa created a litigation\nescrow account following its initial public\noffering of stock in 2008 that funds the\nportion of these settlements attributable to\nVisa-allocated transactions. Any settlement\namounts based on MasterCard-allocated\ntransactions that have not already been paid\nare reflected in our reserves. The networks\nreached a settlement with the injunctive\nrelief class and filed with the District Court\na motion for preliminary approval of the\nsettlement in March 2024. A hearing on the\nsettlement will be held in June 2024.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201c2019 Cybersecurity\nIncident\u201d). As a result of the 2019\nCybersecurity Incident, we have been subject\nto numerous legal proceedings and other\ninquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We are named as a\ndefendant in 5putative consumer class action\ncases in Canadian courts alleging harm from\nthe 2019 Cybersecurity Incident and seeking\nvarious remedies, including monetary and\ninjunctive relief. The lawsuits allege breach\nof contract, negligence, violations of various\nprivacy laws and a variety of other legal\ncauses of action. In August 2021, a trial\ncourt in Ontario dismissed with prejudice one\nof these putative class actions, and on\nJanuary 31, 2024, the Court of Appeals of\nOntario affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision.\nThe Plaintiffs have sought leave to appeal to\nCanada\u2019s Supreme Court. In the second quarter\nof 2022, a trial court in British Columbia\npreliminarily certified a class of all\nimpacted Canadian consumers except those in\nQuebec. The preliminary certification decision\nin British Columbia has been appealed. In the\nthird\n                                              \n  130    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nquarter of 2023, a trial court in Quebec\npreliminarily authorized a class of all\nimpacted consumers in Quebec. This decision\nalso has been appealed. The final two putative\nclass actions, both of which are pending in\nAlberta, are continuing in parallel, but\ncurrently remain at a preliminary stage.\n\nGovernmental inquiries. In August 2020, we\nentered into consent orders with the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System\n(\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) resulting\nfrom regulatory reviews of the 2019\nCybersecurity Incident and relating to ongoing\nenhancements of our cybersecurity and\noperational risk management processes. We paid\nan $ 80million penalty to the U.S. Treasury as\npart of the OCC agreement. The Federal Reserve\nagreement did not contain a monetary penalty.\nThe OCC lifted its consent order on August 31,\n2022 and the Federal Reserve lifted its\nconsent order on July 5, 2023. On August 12,\n2019, Canada\u2019s Office of Privacy Commissioner\n(\u201cOPC\u201d) also initiated an investigation into\nthe 2019 Cybersecurity Incident. That\ninvestigation concluded in April 2024 with no\nfurther action required.\n\nWalmart Litigation\n\nOn April 7, 2023, Walmart filed a lawsuit in\nthe Southern District of New York seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment that it has the\ncontractual right to early termination of the\ncredit card partnership agreement under which\nwe are the exclusive issuer of Walmart\u2019s\nprivate label and co-branded credit card\nprogram in the U.S. and share in certain\nrelated economics. On May 2, 2023, Walmart\nfiled an amended complaint in which it also\nalleged breach of contract and sought damages\ncaused by any delay in termination. On May 4,\n2023, we filed an Answer and Counterclaim to\nWalmart\u2019s amended complaint, denying that\nWalmart has any right to terminate the\npartnership and alleging that Walmart has\nbreached its contractual obligations to\nCapital One. On March 26, 2024, the District\nCourt ruled that Walmart was legally entitled\nto, and did, terminate the partnership\nagreement. The partnership agreement includes\nprovisions for transition upon termination. On\nApril 18, 2024, the court granted the joint\nrequest of the parties for a stay while the\nparties conduct negotiations regarding the\ntermination of the partnership and transition\nof the portfolio.\n\nU.K. PPI Litigation\n\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d)), we\nreceived customer complaints and regulatory\nclaims relating to PPI. COEP has materially\nresolved the PPI complaints and regulatory\nclaims received prior to the deadline. Some of\nthe claimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory\nclaims process have subsequently initiated\nlegal proceedings, seeking additional redress.\nWe are responding to these proceedings as we\nreceive them.\n\nSavings Account Litigation\n\nIn July 2023, Capital One was sued in a\nputative class action in the Eastern District\nof Virginia by savings account holders\nalleging breach of contract and a variety of\nother causes of action relating to Capital\nOne\u2019s introduction of a new savings account\nproduct with a higher interest rate than\nexisting savings account products. Since the\noriginal suit, Capital One was also sued in\nsix similar putative class actions in federal\ncourts in California, Illinois, Ohio,\nVirginia, New Jersey and New York. In March\n2024, Capital One filed with the Judicial\nPanel on Multidistrict Litigation a motion to\nconsolidate and transfer related actions to\nthe Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n\nOther Contingencies\n\nDeposit Insurance Assessments\n\nOn November 16, 2023, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) finalized a\nrule to implement a special assessment to\nrecover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund\n(\u201cDIF\u201d) arising from the protection of\nuninsured depositors in connection with the\nsystemic risk determination announced on March\n12, 2023, following the closures of Silicon\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. In December\n2023, the FDIC provided notification that they\nwould be collecting the special assessment at\nan annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis\npoints (\u201cbps\u201d) over eight quarterly assessment\nperiods, beginning with the first quarter of\n2024 with the first payment due on June 28,\n2024. The special assessment base is equal to\nan insured depository institution\u2019s estimated\n                                              \n  131    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nuninsured deposits reported on its\nConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income\nas of December 31, 2022 (\u201c2022 Call Report\u201d),\nadjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of\nuninsured deposits. We recognized $ 289million\nin operating expense in the fourth quarter of\n2023 associated with the special assessment\nbased on our 2022 Call Report, which was\nrevised and refiled during 2023. In the first\nquarter of 2024, the FDIC announced an\nincrease in their estimate of relevant DIF\nlosses. As a result, we recognized an\nadditional $ 42million in operating expenses,\nwhich increased our established FDIC special\nassessment accrual to $ 331million.\n\nIn the preamble to the final rule, the FDIC\nannounced that it will conduct a review of the\nreporting methodology for estimated uninsured\ndeposits and related items. It is reasonably\npossible amendments will be needed to our 2022\nCall Report due to future legal and regulatory\ndevelopments, which could result in additional\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment. The ultimate amount of expenses\nassociated with the special assessment will\nalso be impacted by the finalization of the\nlosses incurred by the FDIC in the resolutions\nof Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The\namount of reasonably possible additional\nspecial assessment fees beyond our existing\naccrual due to these factors is approximately\n$ 200million.\n                                              \n  132    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.
