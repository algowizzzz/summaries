We also earn non-\ninterest income which primarily consists of\ninterchange income, net of reward expenses,\nservice charges and other customer-related\nfees. Our expenses primarily consist of the\nprovision for credit losses, operating\nexpenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customers served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio and asset/liability management by\nour centralized Corporate Treasury group, are\nincluded in the Other category. Other category\nalso includes unallocated corporate expenses\nthat do not directly support the operations of\nthe business segments or for which the\nbusiness segments are not considered\nfinancially accountable in evaluating their\nperformance, such as certain restructuring\ncharges, as well as residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom.\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our customers typically include\ncompanies with annual revenues between $20\nmillion and $2 billion.\n\nCustomer usage and payment patterns, estimates\nof future expected credit losses, levels of\nmarketing expense and operating efficiency all\naffect our profitability. In our Credit Card\nbusiness, we experience fluctuations in\npurchase volume and the level of outstanding\nloan receivables due to seasonal variances in\nconsumer spending and payment patterns which,\nfor example, have historically been the\nhighest around the winter holiday season. Net\ncharge-off rates for our credit card loan\nportfolio also have historically exhibited\nseasonal patterns as well and generally tend\nto be the highest in the first quarter of the\nyear.\n\nFor additional information on our business\nsegments, including the financial performance\nof each business, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n(\u201cMD&A\u201d)\u2014Executive Summary and Business\nOutlook,\u201d \u201cMD&A\u2014Business Segment Financial\nPerformance\u201d and \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d of\nthis Report.\n                                              \n  6    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n               \n  COMPETITION  \n               \nEach of our business segments operates in a\nhighly competitive environment, and we face\ncompetition in all aspects of our business\nfrom numerous bank and non-bank providers of\nfinancial services.\n\nOur Credit Card business competes with\ninternational, national, regional and local\nissuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards,\nas well as with American Express \u00ae , Discover\nCard \u00ae , private-label card brands, and, to a\ncertain extent, issuers of debit cards. In\ngeneral, customers are attracted to credit\ncard issuers largely on the basis of price,\ncredit limit, reward programs and other\nproduct features.\n\nOur Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses compete with national, state and\ndirect banks for deposits, commercial and auto\nloans, as well as with savings and loan\nassociations and credit unions for loans and\ndeposits. Our competitors also include\nautomotive finance companies, commercial\nmortgage banking companies and other financial\nservices providers that provide loans,\ndeposits, and other similar services and\nproducts. In addition, we compete against non-\ndepository institutions that are able to offer\nthese products and services.\n\nWe also consider new and emerging companies in\ndigital and mobile payments and other\nfinancial technology providers among our\ncompetitors. We compete with many forms of\npayment mechanisms, systems and products,\noffered by both bank and non-bank providers.\n\nOur businesses generally compete on the basis\nof the quality and range of their products and\nservices, transaction execution, innovation\nand price. Competition varies based on the\ntypes of clients, customers, industries and\ngeographies served. Our ability to compete\ndepends, in part, on our ability to attract\nand retain our associates and on our\nreputation as well as our ability to keep pace\nwith innovation, in particular in the\ndevelopment of new technology platforms. There\ncan be no assurance, however, that our ability\nto market products and services successfully\nor to obtain adequate returns on our products\nand services will not be impacted by the\nnature of the competition that now exists or\nmay later develop, or by the broader economic\nenvironment.

In\naddition to banking laws and regulations, we\nare subject to various other laws and\nregulations, all of which directly or\nindirectly affect our operations and\nmanagement and our ability to make\ndistributions to shareholders. We and our\nsubsidiaries are also subject to supervision\nand examination by multiple regulators. In\naddition to laws and regulations, state and\nfederal bank regulatory agencies may issue\npolicy statements, interpretive letters and\nsimilar written guidance applicable to us and\nour subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes,\nregulations or regulatory policies applicable\nto us, including changes in their\ninterpretation or implementation, could have a\nmaterial effect on our business or\norganization.\n\nBoth the scope of the laws and regulations and\nthe intensity of the supervision to which we\nare subject have increased, initially in\nresponse to the financial crisis, and more\nrecently in light of other factors such as\ntechnological, political and market changes.\nRegulatory enforcement and fines have also\nincreased across the banking and financial\nservices sector.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant federal and state laws, as well as\ninternational laws, to which we are subject.\nThe descriptions are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the particular\nstatutory or regulatory provisions summarized.\nThey do not summarize all possible or proposed\nchanges in current laws or regulations and are\nnot intended to be a substitute for the\nrelated statutes or regulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  Banking Regulation                          \n                                              \nCapital One Financial Corporation is a bank\nholding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d) under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHC Act\u201d),\nand is subject to the requirements of the BHC\nAct, including approval requirements for\ninvestments in or acquisitions of banking\norganizations, capital adequacy standards and\nlimitations\n                                              \n  7    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\non non-banking activities. As a BHC and FHC,\nwe are subject to supervision, examination and\nregulation by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d).\nPermissible activities for a BHC include those\nactivities that are so closely related to\nbanking as to be a proper incident thereto. In\naddition, a FHC is permitted to engage in\nactivities considered to be financial in\nnature (including, for example, securities\nunderwriting and dealing and merchant banking\nactivities), incidental to financial\nactivities or, if the Federal Reserve\ndetermines that they pose no risk to the\nsafety or soundness of depository institutions\nor the financial system in general, activities\ncomplementary to financial activities.\n\nTo become and remain eligible for FHC status,\na BHC and its subsidiary depository\ninstitutions must meet certain criteria,\nincluding capital, management and Community\nReinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. Failure\nto meet such criteria could result, depending\non which requirements were not met, in\nrestrictions on new financial activities or\nacquisitions or being required to discontinue\nexisting activities that are not generally\npermissible for BHCs.\n\nThe Banks are national associations chartered\nunder the National Bank Act, and the deposits\nof which are insured by the Deposit Insurance\nFund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) up to applicable limits.\nThe Banks are subject to comprehensive\nregulation and periodic examination by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(\u201cOCC\u201d), the FDIC and the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d). Subject to\nobtaining all regulatory approvals, we plan to\nmerge the Banks in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThere can be no assurance that the merger will\ntake place in this time frame. After the\ncompletion of the merger, Capital One will\nconduct its core banking businesses through\none subsidiary bank, Capital One, National\nAssociation.\n\nWe also are registered as a financial\ninstitution holding company under the laws of\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia and, as such, we\nare subject to periodic examination by the\nVirginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. We\nalso face regulation in the international\njurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nSee \u201cRegulation of Businesses by Authorities\nOutside the United States\u201d below for\nadditional details.\n                                              \n   Regulation of Business Activities          \n                                              \nThe business activities of the Company and the\nBanks are also subject to regulation and\nsupervision under various laws and\nregulations.\n                                              \n  Regulations of Consumer Lending Activities  \n                                              \nThe activities of the Banks as consumer\nlenders are subject to regulation under\nvarious federal laws, including, for example,\nthe Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit\nReporting Act, the CRA, the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of\n2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the Servicemembers\nCivil Relief Act and the Military Lending Act,\nas well as under various state laws. TILA, as\namended, imposes a number of restrictions on\ncredit card practices impacting rates and\nfees, requires that a consumer\u2019s ability to\npay be taken into account before issuing\ncredit or increasing credit limits, and\nimposes revised disclosures required for open-\nend credit.\n\nDepending on the underlying issue and\napplicable law, regulators may be authorized\nto impose penalties for violations of these\nstatutes and, in certain cases, to order banks\nto compensate customers. Borrowers may also\nhave a private right of action for certain\nviolations. Federal bankruptcy and state\ndebtor relief and collection laws may also\naffect the ability of a bank, including the\nBanks, to collect outstanding balances owed by\nborrowers.\n                                              \n  Debit Interchange Fees                      \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of\nany interchange fee received by a debit card\nissuer with respect to debit card transactions\nbe reasonable and proportional to the cost\nincurred by the issuer with respect to the\ntransaction. Rules adopted by the Federal\nReserve to implement these requirements limit\ninterchange fees per debit card transaction to\n$0.21 plus five basis points of the\ntransaction amount and provide for an\nadditional $0.01 fraud prevention adjustment\nto the interchange fee for issuers that meet\ncertain fraud prevention requirements.\n                                              \n  8    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Privacy, Data Protection and Cybersecurity  \n                                              \nWe are subject to a variety of continuously\nevolving and developing laws and regulations\nin the United States and abroad regarding\nprivacy, data protection and data security,\nincluding those related to the collection,\nstorage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer,\nsecurity, and other processing of personal\ninformation. These areas have seen a\nconsiderable increase in legislative and\nregulatory activity over the past several\nyears. For example, in November 2021, the\nFederal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC (collectively,\nthe \u201cFederal Banking Agencies\u201d) issued a final\nrule that, among other things, requires a\nbanking organization to notify its primary\nfederal regulators as soon as possible and no\nlater than 36 hours after determining that a\nsignificant computer-security incident has\noccurred.\n\nIn addition, significant uncertainty exists as\nprivacy, data protection and data security\nlaws may be interpreted and applied\ndifferently from country to country or state\nto state and may create inconsistent or\nconflicting requirements. For example, in the\nUnited States we are subject to the Gramm-\nLeach Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d), among other laws\nand regulations, at the federal level, and in\nCanada we are subject to the Personal\nInformation Protection and Electronic\nDocuments Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d). In addition, the\nEuropean Union (\u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection\nRegulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) applies EU data protection\nlaws to companies that process data of EU\nresidents, and we also are subject to the U.K.\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (\u201cU.K.\nGDPR\u201d). At the U.S. state level, we are\nsubject to a number of laws and regulations,\nsuch as the California Consumer Privacy Act\n(\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1,\n2020. The CCPA and its implementing\nregulations, as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) (which will take\neffect in most material respects on January 1,\n2023), create obligations on covered companies\nto, among other things, share certain\ninformation they have collected about\nindividuals who are California residents with\nthose individuals, subject to some exceptions.\nMany other states have also enacted or are\nconsidering enactment of state-level privacy,\ndata protection and/or data security laws and\nregulations, with which we may be required to\ncomply.\n\nWe continue to monitor privacy, data\nprotection and data security legal\ndevelopments in the jurisdictions in which we\ndo business.

The Basel III\nCapital Rules implement certain capital\nrequirements published by the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d),\nalong with certain provisions of the Dodd-\nFrank Act and other capital provisions.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer and countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirements, as described\nbelow.\n\nFollowing amendments to the Basel III Capital\nRules in October 2019 to provide for tailored\napplication of certain capital requirements\nacross different categories of banking\ninstitutions (the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d), the\nCompany, as a BHC with total consolidated\nassets of at least $250 billion but less than\n$700 billion and not exceeding any of the\napplicable risk-based thresholds, is a\nCategory III institution.\n\nThe Banks, as subsidiaries of a Category III\ninstitution, are Category III banks. Moreover,\nthe Banks, as insured depository institutions,\nare subject to prompt corrective action\n(\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations, as further\ndescribed below.\n\nAs a Category III institution, effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches framework\nand certain associated capital requirements,\nand we have elected to exclude certain\nelements of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our regulatory capital as\npermitted for a Category III institution. We\nremain subject to the countercyclical capital\nbuffer requirement (which is currently set at\n0%) and supplementary leverage ratio\nrequirement of 3.0%.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe \u201cG-SIB Surcharge\u201d. We are not a G-SIB\nbased on the most recent available data and\nthus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. In March\n2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule\nto implement the stress capital buffer\nrequirement (the \u201cStress Capital Buffer\nRule\u201d). The stress capital buffer requirement\nis institution-specific and replaces the fixed\n2.5% capital conservation buffer previously in\nplace for BHCs.\n\nPursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule,\nthe Federal Reserve uses the results of its\nsupervisory stress test to determine the size\nof a BHC\u2019s stress capital buffer requirement.\nIn particular, a BHC\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement equals, subject to a floor of\n2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between\nthe BHC\u2019s starting CET1 capital ratio and its\nlowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the\nseverely adverse scenario of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s supervisory stress test plus (ii)\nthe ratio of the BHC\u2019s projected four quarters\nof common stock dividends (for the fourth to\nseventh quarters of the planning horizon) to\nthe projected risk-weighted assets for the\nquarter in which the BHC\u2019s projected CET1\ncapital ratio reaches its minimum under the\nsupervisory stress test.\n\nUnder the Stress Capital Buffer Rule\nframework, the Company\u2019s \u201cstandardized\napproach capital conservation buffer\u201d includes\nits stress capital buffer requirement (which\nwill be recalibrated every year based on the\nCompany\u2019s supervisory stress test results),\nany G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable\nto us) and the countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement (which is currently set at 0%).\nAny determination to increase the\ncountercyclical capital buffer generally would\nbe effective twelve months after the\nannouncement of such an increase, unless the\nFederal Banking Agencies set an earlier\neffective date.\n                                              \n  11    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2021 supervisory stress\ntesting results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is\n2.5%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%,\n8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Banks. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, each Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%\nrespectively.\n\nIf the Company or any of the Banks fails to\nmaintain its capital ratios above the minimum\ncapital requirements plus the applicable\ncapital conservation buffer requirements, it\nwill face increasingly strict automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments to certain\nexecutive officers.\nSee also \u201cDividends, Stock Repurchases and\nTransfers of Funds\u201d below for more information\nabout the stress capital buffer determination\ntimeline and process.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  Rule                                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (the \u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that\nprovides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the current expected credit losses\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) standard on their regulatory capital\n(the \u201cCECL Transition Election\u201d). We adopted\nthe CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as\nof January 1, 2020, and made the CECL\nTransition Election (for regulatory capital\npurposes) in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company\nand CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule.\nSee \u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d for additional\ninformation.\n                                              \n  FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action         \n                                              \nThe FDICIA requires the Federal Banking\nAgencies to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d\nfor banks that do not meet minimum capital\nrequirements. The FDICIA establishes five\ncapital ratio levels: well capitalized;\nadequately capitalized; undercapitalized;\nsignificantly undercapitalized; and critically\nundercapitalized. The three undercapitalized\ncategories are based upon the amount by which\na bank falls below the ratios applicable to an\nadequately capitalized institution. The\ncapital categories relate to the FDICIA\u2019s PCA\nprovisions, and such capital categories may\nnot constitute an accurate representation of\nthe Banks\u2019 overall financial condition or\nprospects.\n                                              \n  12    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules updated the PCA\nframework to reflect new, higher regulatory\ncapital minimums. For an insured depository\ninstitution to be well capitalized, it must\nmaintain a total risk-based capital ratio of\n10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or\nmore; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more;\nand a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An\nadequately capitalized depository institution\nmust maintain a total risk-based capital ratio\nof 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or\nmore; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a\nleverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for\nCategory III and certain other institutions\nunder the Tailoring Rules, a supplementary\nleverage ratio of 3% or more. The PCA\nprovisions also authorize the Federal Banking\nAgencies to reclassify a bank\u2019s capital\ncategory or take other action against banks\nthat are determined to be in an unsafe or\nunsound condition or to have engaged in unsafe\nor unsound banking practices.\n\nAs an additional means to identify problems in\nthe financial management of depository\ninstitutions, the FDICIA required the Federal\nBanking Agencies to establish certain non-\ncapital safety and soundness standards. The\nstandards adopted by the Federal Banking\nAgencies relate generally to operations and\nmanagement, asset quality, interest rate\nexposure and executive compensation. The\nFederal Banking Agencies are authorized to\ntake action against institutions that fail to\nmeet such standards.\n                                              \n   Basel III and United States Liquidity      \n   Rules                                      \n                                              \nThe Basel Committee has published a liquidity\nframework that includes two standards for\nliquidity risk supervision. One standard, the\nliquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), seeks to\npromote short-term resilience by requiring\norganizations to hold sufficient high-quality\nliquid assets (\u201cHQLAs\u201d) to survive a stress\nscenario lasting for 30 days. The other\nstandard, the net stable funding ratio\n(\u201cNSFR\u201d), seeks to promote longer-term\nresilience by requiring sufficient stable\nfunding over a one-year period based on the\nliquidity characteristics of the\norganization\u2019s assets and activities.\n\nThe Company and the Banks are subject to the\nLCR standard as implemented by the Federal\nReserve and OCC (the \u201cLCR Rule\u201d). The LCR Rule\nrequires the Company and each of the Banks to\nhold an amount of eligible HQLA that equals or\nexceeds 100% of its respective projected\nadjusted net cash outflows over a 30-day\nperiod, each as calculated in accordance with\nthe LCR Rule. The LCR Rule requires us to\ncalculate our LCR daily. In addition, the\nCompany is required to make quarterly public\ndisclosures of its LCR and certain related\nquantitative liquidity metrics, along with a\nqualitative discussion of its LCR.\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, as a Category III\ninstitution with less than $75 billion in\nweighted average short-term wholesale funding,\nthe Company\u2019s and the Banks\u2019 total net cash\noutflows are multiplied by an outflow\nadjustment percentage of 85%. Although the\nBanks may hold more HQLA than they need to\nmeet their LCR requirements, the LCR Rule\nrestricts the amount of such excess HQLA held\nat the Banks (referred to as \u201cTrapped\nLiquidity\u201d) that can be included in the\nCompany\u2019s HQLA amount. Because we typically\nmanage the Banks\u2019 LCRs to levels well above\n100%, the result is additional Trapped\nLiquidity as the Banks\u2019 net cash outflows are\nreduced by the outflow adjustment percentage\nof 85%.\n\nIn October 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies\nfinalized a rule to implement the NSFR in the\nUnited States (the \u201cNSFR Rule\u201d). The NSFR Rule\nrequires the Company and each of the Banks to\nmaintain an amount of available stable\nfunding, which is a weighted measure of a\ncompany\u2019s funding sources over a one-year time\nhorizon, calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to equity and liabilities based on\ntheir expected stability, that is no less than\na specified percentage of its required stable\nfunding, which is calculated by applying\nstandardized weightings to assets, derivatives\nexposures and certain other items based on\ntheir liquidity characteristics. As a Category\nIII institution, the Company and the Banks are\neach required to maintain available stable\nfunding in an amount at least equal to 85% of\nits required stable funding. The NSFR Rule\nbecame effective on July 1, 2021 and applies\nto the Company and each of the Banks. The NSFR\nRule includes a semi-annual public disclosure\nrequirement, with the first disclosure due 45\ndays after the end of the second quarter of\n2023.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Other\nRelated Requirements\nWe are subject to certain enhanced prudential\nstandards under the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended\nby the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and\nConsumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d) and\nimplemented by various regulations issued by\nthe Federal Banking Agencies. The Financial\nStability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) may also\nissue recommendations to the Federal Reserve\nor other primary financial regulatory agencies\nto apply new or enhanced standards to certain\nfinancial activities or practices.\n\nAs part of the enhanced prudential standards,\nthe Company is required to implement\nresolution planning for orderly resolution in\nthe event it faces material financial distress\nor failure. The FDIC issued similar rules\nregarding resolution planning applicable to\nthe Banks. In addition, the OCC has issued\nrules requiring banks with assets of $250\nbillion or more to develop recovery\n                                              \n  13    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nplans detailing the actions they would take to\nremain a going concern when they experience\nconsiderable financial or operational stress,\nbut have not deteriorated to the point that\nresolution is imminent.\n\nThe enhanced prudential standards also include\nsupervisory and company-run stress testing\nrequirements (also known as the \u201cDFAST stress\ntesting requirements\u201d). In particular, the\nFederal Reserve is required to conduct annual\nstress tests on certain covered companies,\nincluding us, to ensure that the covered\ncompanies have sufficient capital to absorb\nlosses and continue operations during adverse\neconomic conditions, as well as to determine\nthe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement as described above. As a covered\ncompany that is a Category III institution\nunder the Tailoring Rules, we are also\nrequired to conduct our own stress tests and\npublish the results of such tests on our\nwebsite or other public forum. The Company\nmust disclose the results of its company-run\nstress test on a biennial basis. The OCC has\nadopted a similar stress test rule requiring\nbanks with at least $250 billion in assets,\nincluding CONA, to conduct their own company-\nrun stress tests. Under that OCC rule, CONA\nmust also disclose the results of its stress\ntest on a biennial basis.\n\nIn addition, the Company is required to meet\nliquidity risk management standards, conduct\ninternal liquidity stress tests, and maintain\na 30-day buffer of highly liquid assets, in\neach case, consistent with the requirements of\nthe enhanced prudential standards. These\nrequirements are in addition to the LCR and\nNSFR Rules, discussed above in \u201cBasel III and\nUnited States Liquidity Rules.\u201d The enhanced\nprudential standards also require that the\nCompany comply with, and hold capital\ncommensurate with, the requirements of, any\nregulations adopted by the Federal Reserve\nrelating to capital planning and stress tests.\nStress testing and capital planning\nregulations are discussed further below under\n\u201cDividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of\nFunds.\u201d Finally, the Company is also required\nto establish and maintain an enterprise-wide\nrisk management framework that includes a risk\ncommittee and a chief risk officer.\n\nAlthough not a requirement of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, the OCC established regulatory guidelines\n(\u201cHeightened Standards Guidelines\u201d) that apply\nheightened standards to the governance and\nrisk management practices of large\ninstitutions subject to its supervision,\nincluding the Banks. The Heightened Standards\nGuidelines establish standards for the\ndevelopment and implementation by the Banks of\na risk governance framework.\nDividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfers of\nFunds\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital planning\nrules and related supervisory process\n(commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review or \u201cCCAR\u201d requirements), a\n\u201ccovered BHC,\u201d such as the Company, must\nsubmit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve\non an annual basis that contains a description\nof all planned capital actions, including\ndividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-\nquarter planning horizon beginning with the\nfirst quarter of the calendar year the capital\nplan is submitted (\u201cCCAR cycle\u201d).\n\nThe DFAST stress testing requirements,\ndescribed above in \u201cEnhanced Prudential\nStandards and Other Related Requirements,\u201d is\na complementary exercise to CCAR. It is a\nforward-looking exercise conducted by the\nFederal Reserve and each covered company to\nhelp assess whether a company has sufficient\ncapital to absorb losses and continue\noperations during adverse economic conditions.\n\nPursuant to the capital planning rules, the\nCompany must file its capital plan with the\nFederal Reserve by April 5 of each year\n(unless the Federal Reserve designates a later\ndate), using data as of the end of the prior\ncalendar year. The Federal Reserve will\nrelease the results of the supervisory stress\ntest and notify the Company of its stress\ncapital buffer requirement by June 30 of that\nyear. The Company will have two business days\nfrom receipt of its stress capital buffer\nrequirement to make any necessary adjustments\nto its planned capital distributions. The\nFederal Reserve will then finalize the stress\ncapital buffer requirement for the Company and\nconfirm the Company\u2019s planned capital\ndistributions by August 31 of that year. The\nCompany\u2019s final stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be effective from the fourth\nquarter of the year the capital plan is\nsubmitted through the third quarter of the\nfollowing year. The Company may make the\nplanned capital distributions confirmed by the\nFederal Reserve. In addition, under the Stress\nCapital Buffer Rule, the Company is no longer\nrequired to seek prior approval of the Federal\nReserve to make capital distributions in\nexcess of those included in its capital plan\nso long as the Company is otherwise in\ncompliance with the capital rule\u2019s automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has announced that it\nwould maintain its pre-CECL framework for\ncalculating allowances on loans in the\nsupervisory stress test through the 2023 cycle\nuntil the impact of CECL is better known and\nunderstood.\n\nDividends from the Company\u2019s direct and\nindirect subsidiaries represent a major source\nof the funds we use to pay dividends on our\ncapital stock, make payments on our corporate\ndebt securities and meet our other\nobligations. There are various federal law\n                                              \n  14    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nlimitations on the extent to which the Banks\ncan finance or otherwise supply funds to the\nCompany through dividends and loans. These\nlimitations include minimum regulatory capital\nrequirements, federal banking law requirements\nconcerning the payment of dividends out of net\nprofits or surplus, provisions of Sections 23A\nand 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and\nRegulation W governing transactions between an\ninsured depository institution and its\naffiliates, as well as general federal\nregulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or\nunsound practices. In general, federal and\napplicable state banking laws prohibit insured\ndepository institutions, such as the Banks,\nfrom making dividend distributions without\nfirst obtaining regulatory approval if such\ndistributions are not paid out of available\nearnings or would cause the institution to\nfail to meet applicable capital adequacy\nstandards.\n                                              \n  Investment in the Company and the Banks     \n                                              \nCertain acquisitions of our capital stock may\nbe subject to regulatory approval or notice\nunder federal or state law. Investors are\nresponsible for ensuring that they do not,\ndirectly or indirectly, acquire shares of our\ncapital stock in excess of the amount that can\nbe acquired without regulatory approval,\nincluding under the BHC Act and the Change in\nBank Control Act (\u201cCIBC Act\u201d).\n\nFederal law and regulations prohibit any\nperson or company from acquiring control of\nthe Company or the Banks without, in most\ncases, prior written approval of the Federal\nReserve or the OCC, as applicable. Control\nunder the BHC Act exists if, among other\nthings, a person or company acquires more than\n25% of any class of our voting stock or\notherwise has a controlling influence over us.\nA rebuttable presumption of control arises\nunder the CIBC Act for a publicly traded BHC\nsuch as ourselves if a person or company\nacquires more than 10% of any class of our\nvoting stock.\n\nAdditionally, COBNA and CONA are \u201cbanks\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Chapter 7 of Title 6.2\nof the Code of Virginia governing the\nacquisition of interests in Virginia financial\ninstitutions (\u201cFinancial Institution Holding\nCompany Act\u201d). The Financial Institution\nHolding Company Act prohibits any person or\nentity from acquiring, or making any public\noffer to acquire, control of a Virginia\nfinancial institution or its holding company\nwithout making application to, and receiving\nprior approval from, the Virginia Bureau of\nFinancial Institutions.\n                                              \n  Deposit Insurance Assessments               \n                                              \nEach of CONA and COBNA, as an insured\ndepository institution, is a member of the DIF\nmaintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the\nFDIC insures the deposits of insured\ndepository institutions up to prescribed\nlimits for each depositor. The FDIC sets a\nDesignated Reserve Ratio (\u201cDRR\u201d) for the DIF.\nTo maintain the DIF, member institutions may\nbe assessed an insurance premium, and the FDIC\nmay take action to increase insurance premiums\nif the DRR falls below its required level.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio\nfell to 1.30 percent. The FDIC, as required\nunder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\nestablished a plan in September 2020, to\nrestore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or\nexceed 1.35 percent within eight years. The\nFDIC\u2019s restoration plan projects the reserve\nratio to exceed 1.35 percent without\nincreasing the deposit insurance assessment\nrate, subject to ongoing monitoring over the\nnext eight years.\nSource of Strength and Liability for Commonly\nControlled Institutions\nUnder regulations issued by the Federal\nReserve, a BHC must serve as a source of\nfinancial and managerial strength to its\nsubsidiary banks (the so-called \u201csource of\nstrength doctrine\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Act\ncodified this doctrine.\n\nUnder the \u201ccross-guarantee\u201d provision of the\nFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery and\nEnforcement Act of 1989 (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), insured\ndepository institutions such as the Banks may\nbe liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss\nincurred, or reasonably anticipated to be\nincurred, by the FDIC in connection with the\ndefault of, or FDIC assistance to, any\ncommonly controlled insured depository\ninstitution. The Banks are commonly controlled\nwithin the meaning of the FIRREA cross-\nguarantee provision.\n                                              \n  FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority          \n                                              \nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with\nliquidation authority that may be used to\nliquidate non-bank financial companies and\nBHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in\nconsultation with the President and based on\nthe recommendation of the Federal Reserve and\nother appropriate Federal Banking Agencies,\ndetermines that doing so is necessary, among\nother criteria, to mitigate serious adverse\neffects on U.S. financial stability. Upon such\na determination, the FDIC would be appointed\nreceiver and must liquidate the company in a\nway that mitigates significant risks to\nfinancial stability and minimizes moral\nhazard. The costs of a liquidation of the\ncompany would be borne by shareholders and\nunsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by\nrisk-\n                                              \n  15    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nbased assessments on large financial\ncompanies.

For example, the CARES Act established\nseveral programs with the Small Business\nAdministration, including the Paycheck\nProtection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), to provide loans\nto small businesses. The CARES Act also gave\nbanking organizations an option to temporarily\nsuspend the determination of certain qualified\nloans modified as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic as being troubled debt restructurings\n(\u201cTDRs\u201d), which was extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and\nexpired on January 1, 2022.\n\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and\nrelated public health measures, see \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1A.

A key part of our\nstrategic focus is the development and use of\nefficient, flexible computer and operational\nsystems, such as cloud technology, to support\ncomplex marketing and account management\nstrategies, the servicing of our customers,\nand the development of new and diversified\nproducts. We believe that the continued\ndevelopment and integration of these systems\nis an important part of our efforts to reduce\ncosts, improve quality and security and\nprovide faster, more flexible technology\nservices. Consequently, we continuously review\ncapabilities and develop or acquire systems,\nprocesses and competencies to meet our unique\nbusiness requirements.\n\nAs part of our continuous efforts to review\nand improve our technologies, we may either\ndevelop such capabilities internally or rely\non third-party outsourcers who have the\nability to deliver technology that is of\nhigher quality, lower cost, or both. We\ncontinue to rely on third-party outsourcers to\nhelp us deliver systems and operational\ninfrastructure. These relationships include\n(but are not limited to): Amazon Web Services,\nInc. (\u201cAWS\u201d) for our cloud infrastructure,\nTotal System Services LLC (\u201cTSYS\u201d) for\nconsumer and commercial credit card processing\nservices for our North American and U.K.\nportfolios and Fidelity Information Services\n(\u201cFIS\u201d) for certain of our banking systems.\n\nWe are committed to safeguarding our\ncustomers\u2019 and our own information and\ntechnology, implementing backup and recovery\nsystems, and generally require the same of our\nthird-party service providers. We take\nmeasures that mitigate against known attacks\nand use internal and external resources to\nscan for vulnerabilities in platforms,\nsystems, and applications necessary for\ndelivering our products and services. For a\ndiscussion of the risks associated with our\nuse of technology systems, see \u201cPart I\u2014Item\n1A.

We also\nundertake other measures to control access to,\nor distribution of, our other proprietary\ninformation. Despite these precautions, it may\nbe possible for a third party to copy or\notherwise obtain and use certain intellectual\nproperty or proprietary information without\nauthorization. Our precautions may not prevent\nmisappropriation or infringement of our\nintellectual property or proprietary\ninformation. In addition, our competitors and\nother third parties also file patent\napplications for innovations that are used in\nour industry. The ability of our competitors\nand other third parties to obtain patents may\nadversely affect our ability to compete and\nour financial results. Conversely, our ability\nto obtain patents may increase our competitive\nadvantage, preserve our freedom to operate,\nand allow us to enter into licensing (e.g.,\ncross-licenses) or other arrangements with\nthird parties. There can be no assurance that\nwe will be successful in such efforts, or that\nthe ability of our competitors to obtain such\npatents may not adversely impact our financial\nresults.

These risk\nfactors do not identify all risks that we\nface; our operations could also be affected by\nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not\npresently known to us or that we currently do\nnot consider to present significant risks to\nour operations. In addition, the global\neconomic and political climate may amplify\nmany of these risks.\n                                              \n  Summary of Risk Factors                     \n                                              \nBelow is a summary of the principal factors\nthat make an investment in our securities\nrisky.

Such adverse\nconsequences include labor shortages and\ndisruptions of global supply chains. The\ngrowth in economic activity and demand for\ngoods and services, alongside labor shortages\nand supply chain complications, has also\ncontributed to rising inflationary pressures\nand could adversely affect our business.\nShould these ongoing effects of the pandemic\ncontinue for\n                                              \n  22    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nan extended period or worsen, our purchase\nvolume, loan balances and the overall demand\nfor our products and services may be\nsignificantly impacted, which could adversely\naffect our revenue and other results of\noperations. In addition, we could experience\nhigher credit losses in our loan portfolios\nand increases in our allowance for credit\nlosses beyond current levels. We could also\nexperience impairments of other financial\nassets and other negative impacts on our\nfinancial position, including possible\nconstraints on liquidity and capital, as well\nas higher costs of capital. Even after the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may\ncontinue to experience adverse impacts to our\nbusiness and results of operations, which\ncould be material, as a result of the\nmacroeconomic impact and any recession that\nhas occurred or may occur in the future.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused us to modify our\nbusiness practices and operations, including\nproviding a range of forbearance options to\nour customers in certain circumstances. We may\nneed to further modify our practices and\noperations as the pandemic remains dynamic and\nthe emergence of variants resistant to\nexisting vaccines remains uncertain. We also\nimplemented work-from-home policies for a vast\nmajority of our employees, and social\ndistancing plans for our employees who are\nworking from Capital One facilities. Nearly\nall of our Caf\u00e9s and bank branches across our\nnetwork are open with increased safety\nprecautions. We will continue to monitor local\nconditions to ensure the safety of our\nassociates and customers while providing\ncritical banking services. These measures\ncould impair our ability to perform critical\nfunctions and may adversely impact our results\nof operations. In addition, these measures and\nother changes in consumer behavior as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic may require changes\nto retail distribution strategies and\nadversely impact our investments in our bank\npremises and equipment and other retail\ndistribution assets, leading to increased\ncosts and exposure to additional risks. We may\ntake further actions as required by government\nauthorities or that we otherwise determine are\nin the best interests of our customers,\nemployees and business partners.\n\nSince the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nfederal, state, local and foreign governmental\nauthorities enacted regulations and protocols\nin response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding governmental programs intended to\nprovide economic relief to businesses and\nindividuals. We participated in certain of\nthese programs, including participating as an\neligible lender in the Small Business\nAdministration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program.\nOur participation in and execution of any such\nprograms may cause operational, compliance,\nreputational and credit risks, which could\nresult in litigation, governmental action or\nother forms of loss. The extent of these\nimpacts, which may be substantial, depends, in\npart, on the degree of our participation in\nthese programs. There remains significant\nuncertainty regarding the measures that\nauthorities will enact in the future and the\nultimate impact of the legislation,\nregulations and protocols that have been and\nwill be enacted. Moreover, we expect that the\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten\nmany of the other known risks described\nherein. See \u201cPart I\u2014Item\n1.\u2014Business\u2014Overview\u2014Coronavirus Disease 2019\n(COVID-19) Pandemic\u201d.\n\nThe extent to which the consequences of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic affect our businesses,\nresults of operations and financial condition,\nas well as our regulatory capital and\nliquidity ratios and our ability to take\ncapital actions, will depend on future\ndevelopments that remain uncertain, including,\nfor example, the rate of distribution and\nadministration of vaccines globally, the\nseverity and duration of any resurgence of\nCOVID-19 variants, future actions taken by\ngovernmental authorities, central banks and\nother third parties in response to the\npandemic, and the effects on our customers,\ncounterparties, employees and third-party\nservice providers.\n\nChanges and instability in the macroeconomic\nenvironment, consumer confidence and customer\nbehavior may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe offer a broad array of financial products\nand services to consumers, small businesses\nand commercial clients. A prolonged period of\neconomic volatility, slow growth, or a\nsignificant deterioration in economic\nconditions, in the U.S., Canada or the U.K.,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations\nas customers default on their loans, maintain\nlower deposit levels or, in the case of credit\ncard accounts, carry lower balances and reduce\ncredit card purchase activity.\n\nSome of the risks we face in connection with\nadverse changes and instability in the\nmacroeconomic environment, including changes\nin consumer confidence levels and behavior,\ninclude the following:\n\n\u2022 Changes in payment patterns, increases in\ndelinquencies and default rates, decreased\nconsumer spending, inflation, lower demand for\ncredit and shifts in consumer payment behavior\ntowards avoiding late fees, finance charges\nand other fees;\n\n\u2022 Increases in our charge-off rate caused by\nbankruptcies and reduced ability to recover\ndebt that we have previously charged-off;\n                                              \n  23    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Decreased reliability of the process and\nmodels we use to estimate our allowance for\nloan and lease losses, particularly if\nunexpected variations in key inputs and\nassumptions cause actual losses to diverge\nfrom the projections of our models and our\nestimates become increasingly subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. See \u201c We face risks\nresulting from the extensive use of models and\ndata. \u201d\n\nThe U.K. and the European Union agreed to a\nfree trade deal at the end of 2020 relating to\nthe U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union.\nAlthough this deal provides greater near-term\nstability, there is still some degree of\nuncertainty as to the relationship between the\nU.K and the European Union, which may increase\nvolatility in the regional and global\nfinancial markets. We continue to consider and\nmonitor the potential impacts, and other\nfactors that could also impact U.K. economic\nperformance.\n\nFinancial market instability and volatility\ncould adversely affect our business.\n\nOur ability to borrow from other financial\ninstitutions or to engage in funding\ntransactions on favorable terms or at all\ncould be adversely affected by disruptions in\nthe capital markets or other events, including\nactions by rating agencies and deteriorating\ninvestor expectations. In addition,\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads\nand other market factors could negatively\nimpact our results of operations. Both\nshorter-term and longer-term interest rates\nremain below long-term historical averages and\nthe yield curve has been relatively flat\ncompared to past periods. A flat yield curve\ncombined with low interest rates generally\nleads to lower revenue and reduced margins\nbecause it can decrease the spread between\nasset yields and funding costs. Sustained\nperiods of time with a flat yield curve\ncoupled with low interest rates, or an\ninversion of the yield curve, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our net interest\nmargin and earnings.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nWe may experience increased delinquencies,\ncredit losses, inaccurate estimates and\ninadequate reserves.\nLike other lenders, we face the risk that our\ncustomers will not repay their loans. A\ncustomer\u2019s ability and willingness to repay us\ncan be adversely affected by decreases in the\nincome of the borrower or increases in their\npayment obligations to other lenders, whether\nas a result of higher debt levels or rising\ninterest rates, by rising levels of inflation,\nor by restricted availability of credit\ngenerally. We may fail to quickly identify and\nreduce our exposure to customers that are\nlikely to default on their payment\nobligations, whether by closing credit lines\nor restricting authorizations. Our ability to\nmanage credit risk also is affected by legal\nor regulatory changes (such as restrictions on\ncollections, bankruptcy laws, minimum payment\nregulations and re-age guidance), competitors\u2019\nactions and consumer behavior, and depends on\nthe effectiveness of our collections staff,\ntechniques and models.\n\nRising losses or leading indicators of rising\nlosses (such as higher delinquencies, higher\nrates of nonperforming loans, higher\nbankruptcy rates, lower collateral values,\nelevated unemployment rates or changing market\nterms) may require us to increase our\nallowance for credit losses, which would\ndecrease our profitability if we are unable to\nraise revenue or reduce costs to compensate\nfor higher losses. In particular, we face the\nfollowing risks in this area:\n\n\u2022 Missed Payments: Our customers may miss\npayments. Loan charge-offs (including from\nbankruptcies) are generally preceded by missed\npayments or other indications of worsening\nfinancial condition for our customers.\nHistorically, customers are more likely to\nmiss payments during an economic downturn or\nprolonged periods of slow economic growth. In\naddition, we face the risk that consumer and\ncommercial customer behavior may change (for\nexample, an increase in the unwillingness or\ninability of customers to repay debt, which\nmay be heightened by increasing interest rates\nor levels of consumer debt), causing a long-\nterm rise in delinquencies and charge-offs.\n\n\u2022 Incorrect Estimates of Expected Losses: The\ncredit quality of our portfolio can have a\nsignificant impact on our earnings. We allow\nfor and reserve against credit risks based on\nour assessment of expected credit losses in\nour loan portfolios. This process, which is\ncritical to our financial condition and\nresults of operations, requires complex\njudgments, including forecasts of economic\nconditions. We may underestimate our expected\nlosses and fail to hold an allowance for\ncredit losses sufficient to account for these\nlosses. Incorrect assumptions could lead to\nmaterial underestimations of expected credit\nlosses and an inadequate allowance for credit\nlosses.\n\n\u2022 Inaccurate Underwriting: Our ability to\naccurately assess the creditworthiness of our\ncustomers may diminish, which could result in\nan increase in our credit losses and a\ndeterioration of our returns. See \u201c Our risk\nmanagement strategies may not be fully\neffective in mitigating our risk exposures in\nall market environments or against all types\nof risk .\u201d\n                                              \n  24    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Business Mix: We engage in a diverse mix of\nbusinesses with a broad range of potential\ncredit exposure. Because we originate a\nrelatively greater proportion of consumer\nloans in our loan portfolio compared to other\nlarge bank peers and originate both prime and\nsubprime credit card accounts and auto loans,\nwe may experience higher delinquencies and a\ngreater number of accounts charging off\ncompared to other large bank peers, which\ncould result in increased credit losses,\noperating costs and regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, a change in this business mix\nover time to include proportionally more\nconsumer loans or subprime credit card\naccounts or auto loans could adversely affect\nthe credit quality of our portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Increasing Charge-off Recognition/Allowance\nfor Credit Losses: We account for the\nallowance for credit losses according to\naccounting and regulatory guidelines and\nrules, including Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) standards and the\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination\nCouncil (\u201cFFIEC\u201d) Account Management Guidance.\nEffective as of January 1, 2020, we adopted\nthe CECL standard which is based on expected\nlifetime losses rather than incurred losses.\nAdoption of the CECL standard has resulted and\nmay continue to result in an increase to our\nreserves for credit losses on financial\ninstruments with a resulting adverse impact on\nour financial condition. The continued impact\nof CECL on our results will depend on the\ncharacteristics of our financial instruments,\neconomic conditions, and our economic and loss\nforecasts. The application of the CECL\nstandard requires us to increase reserves\nfaster and to a higher level in an economic\ndownturn, resulting in greater impact to our\nresults and our capital ratios than we would\nhave experienced in similar circumstances\nprior to the adoption of CECL. In addition,\nbecause credit cards represent a significant\nportion of our product mix, we could be\ndisproportionately affected by use of the CECL\nstandard, as compared to our large bank peers\nwith a different product mix.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Asset Values: The collateral we\nhave on secured loans could be insufficient to\ncompensate us for credit losses. When\ncustomers default on their secured loans, we\nattempt to recover collateral where\npermissible and appropriate. However, the\nvalue of the collateral may not be sufficient\nto compensate us for the amount of the unpaid\nloan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering\nthe remaining balance from our customers.\nDecreases in real estate and other asset\nvalues adversely affect the collateral value\nfor our commercial lending activities, while\nthe auto business is similarly exposed to\ncollateral risks arising from the auction\nmarkets that determine used car prices.\nBorrowers may be less likely to continue\nmaking payments on loans if the value of the\nproperty used as collateral for the loan is\nless than what the borrower owes, even if the\nborrower is still financially able to make the\npayments. In that circumstance, the recovery\nof such property could be insufficient to\ncompensate us for the value of these loans\nupon a default. In our auto business, business\nand economic conditions that negatively affect\nhousehold incomes, housing prices and consumer\nbehavior, as well as technological advances\nthat make older cars obsolete faster, could\ndecrease (i) the demand for new and used\nvehicles and (ii) the value of the collateral\nunderlying our portfolio of auto loans, which\ncould cause the number of consumers who become\ndelinquent or default on their loans to\nincrease.\n\n\u2022 Geographic and Industry Concentration:\nAlthough our consumer lending is\ngeographically diversified, approximately 45%\nof our commercial real estate loan portfolio\nis concentrated in the Northeast region. The\nregional economic conditions in the Northeast\naffect the demand for our commercial products\nand services as well as the ability of our\ncustomers to repay their commercial real\nestate loans and the value of the collateral\nsecuring these loans. An economic downturn or\nprolonged period of slow economic growth in,\nor a catastrophic event that\ndisproportionately affects, including as a\nresult of climate change, the Northeast region\ncould have a material adverse effect on the\nperformance of our commercial real estate loan\nportfolio and our results of operations. In\naddition, our Commercial Banking strategy\nincludes an industry-specific focus. If any of\nthe industries that we focus on experience\nchanges, we may experience increased credit\nlosses and our results of operations could be\nadversely impacted.\n                                              \n   Capital and Liquidity Risk                 \n                                              \nWe may not be able to maintain adequate\ncapital or liquidity levels, which could have\na negative impact on our financial results and\nour ability to return capital to our\nstockholders.\n\nFinancial institutions are subject to\nextensive and complex capital and liquidity\nrequirements, which are subject to change.\nThese requirements affect our ability to lend,\ngrow deposit balances, make acquisitions and\ndistribute capital. Failure to maintain\nadequate capital or liquidity levels, whether\ndue to adverse developments in our business or\nthe economy or to changes in the applicable\nrequirements, could subject us to a variety of\nremedies available to our regulators. These\ninclude limitations on the ability to pay\ndividends and/or repurchase shares and the\nissuance of a capital directive to increase\ncapital. Such limitations or capital directive\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of operations.\n                                              \n  25    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe consider various factors in the management\nof capital, including the impact of both\ninternal and supervisory stress scenarios on\nour capital levels as determined by both our\ninternal modeling and the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nmodeling of our capital position in\nsupervisory stress tests. There can be\nsignificant differences between our modeling\nand the Federal Reserve\u2019s projections for a\ngiven supervisory stress scenario and between\nthe capital needs suggested by our internal\nstress scenarios relative to the supervisory\nscenarios. Therefore, although our estimated\ncapital levels under stress disclosed as part\nof the stress testing processes may suggest\nthat we have a particular capacity to return\ncapital to stockholders and remain well\ncapitalized under stress, the Federal\nReserve\u2019s modeling, our internal modeling of\nanother scenario and/or other factors related\nto our capital management process may reflect\na lower capacity to return capital to\nstockholders than that indicated by the\nprojections released in the stress testing\nprocesses. This in turn, could lead to\nrestrictions on our ability to pay dividends\nand engage in share repurchases. See \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d\nfor additional information.\n\nWe also consider various factors in the\nmanagement of liquidity, including maintaining\nsufficient liquid assets to meet the\nrequirements of several internal and\nregulatory stress tests. There can be\nsignificant differences in estimated liquidity\nneeds between internal and regulatory stress\ntesting, and liquidity resources required to\nmeet regulatory requirements, such as\napplicable LCR and NSFR requirements, may\nexceed what would otherwise be required to\nsatisfy internal liquidity metrics and stress\ntesting. Regulatory liquidity stress testing\nand regulatory liquidity requirements may,\ntherefore, require us to take actions to\nincrease our liquid assets or alter our\nactivities or funding sources, which could\nnegatively affect our financial results or our\nability to return capital to our stockholders.\nSee \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u201d for additional information.\n\nIn response to economic uncertainty due to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve\nrequired certain large BHCs, including us, to\nsuspend share repurchases and cap common stock\ndividends and subsequently extended the\nrestrictions into the first half of 2021 with\ncertain modifications to permit resumptions of\nshare repurchases. Although these temporary\nrestrictions on our capital actions ended on\nJune 30, 2021, it is possible that the Federal\nReserve could impose similar restrictions in\nthe future. Further changes to applicable\ncapital and liquidity requirements could\nresult in unexpected or new limitations on our\nability to pay dividends and engage in share\nrepurchases.\n\nLimitations on our ability to receive\ndividends from our subsidiaries could affect\nour liquidity and ability to pay dividends and\nrepurchase common stock.\n\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity\nfrom our subsidiaries, including the Banks and\nour broker-dealer subsidiaries. Dividends to\nus from these direct and indirect subsidiaries\nhave represented a major source of funds for\nus to pay dividends on our common and\npreferred stock, repurchase common stock, make\npayments on corporate debt securities and meet\nother obligations. There are various federal\nlaw limitations on the extent to which the\nBanks can finance or otherwise supply funds to\nus through dividends and loans. These\nlimitations include minimum regulatory capital\nrequirements, federal banking law requirements\nconcerning the payment of dividends out of net\nprofits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of\nthe Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W\ngoverning transactions between an insured\ndepository institution and its affiliates, as\nwell as general federal regulatory oversight\nto prevent unsafe or unsound practices. Our\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are also subject to\nlaws and regulations, including net capital\nrequirements, that may limit their ability to\npay dividends or make other distributions to\nus. If our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not\nsufficient to make dividend payments to us\nwhile maintaining adequate capital levels, our\nliquidity may be affected and we may not be\nable to make dividend payments to our common\nor preferred stockholders, repurchase our\ncommon stock, make payments on outstanding\ncorporate debt securities or meet other\nobligations, each and any of which could have\na material adverse impact on our results of\noperations, our financial position or the\nperception of our financial health. See \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d\nfor additional information regarding dividend\nlimitations applicable to us and the Banks.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nWe face risks related to our operational,\ntechnological and organizational\ninfrastructure.\nOur ability to retain and attract customers\ndepends on our ability to develop, operate,\nand adapt our technology and organizational\ninfrastructure in a rapidly changing\nenvironment. In addition, we must accurately\nprocess, record and monitor an increasingly\nlarge number of complex transactions. Digital\ntechnology, data and software development are\ndeeply embedded into our business model and\nhow we work.\n\nSimilar to other large corporations, we are\nexposed to operational risk that can manifest\nitself in many ways, such as errors in\nexecution, inadequate processes, inaccurate\nmodels, faulty or disabled technological\ninfrastructure, malicious disruption and\n                                              \n  26    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nfraud by employees or persons outside of our\ncompany, whether through attacks on Capital\nOne directly or on our customers. In addition,\nwe are heavily dependent on the security,\ncapability and continuous availability of the\ntechnology systems that we use to manage our\ninternal financial and other systems, monitor\nrisk and compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, provide services to our\ncustomers, develop and offer new products and\ncommunicate with stakeholders. We also face\nrisk of adverse customer impacts and business\ndisruption arising from the execution of\nstrategic initiatives we may pursue across our\noperations.\n\nIf we do not maintain the necessary\noperational, technological and organizational\ninfrastructure to operate our business,\nincluding to maintain the resiliency and\nsecurity of that infrastructure, our business\nand reputation could be materially adversely\naffected. We also are subject to disruptions\nto our systems arising from events that are\nwholly or partially beyond our control, which\nmay include computer viruses, electrical or\ntelecommunications outages, design flaws in\nfoundational components or platforms,\navailability and quality of vulnerability\npatches from key vendors, cyber-attacks and\nother security incidents (including\nDistributed Denial of Service (\u201cDDOS\u201d) and\nother attacks on our infrastructure as\ndiscussed below), natural disasters, other\ndamage to property or physical assets, or\nevents arising from local or larger scale\npolitics, including terrorist acts. Any\nfailure to maintain our infrastructure or\ndisruption of our systems and applications\ncould diminish our ability to operate our\nbusinesses, service customer accounts and\nprotect customers\u2019 information, or result in\npotential liability to customers, reputational\ndamage, regulatory intervention and customers\u2019\nloss of confidence in our businesses, any of\nwhich could result in a material adverse\neffect.\n\nWe also rely on the business infrastructure\nand systems of third parties with which we do\nbusiness and to whom we outsource the\noperation, maintenance and development of our\ninformation technology and communications\nsystems. We have migrated substantially all\naspects of our core information technology\nsystems and customer-facing applications to\nthird-party cloud infrastructure platforms,\nprincipally AWS. If we fail to administer\nthese new environments in a well-managed,\nsecure and effective manner, or if such\nplatforms become unavailable or do not meet\ntheir service level agreements for any reason,\nwe may experience unplanned service disruption\nor unforeseen costs which could result in\nmaterial harm to our business and results of\noperations. We must successfully develop and\nmaintain information, financial reporting,\ndisclosure, privacy, data-protection, data\nsecurity and other controls adapted to our\nreliance on outside platforms and providers.\nIn addition, AWS, or other service providers,\ncould experience system breakdowns or\nfailures, outages, downtime, cyber-attacks and\nother security incidents, adverse changes to\nfinancial condition, bankruptcy, or other\nadverse conditions, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and\nreputation. Thus, the substantial amount of\nour infrastructure that we outsource to AWS or\nto other third parties may increase our risk\nexposure.\n\nAny disruptions, failures or inaccuracies of\nour operational processes, technology systems\nand models, including those associated with\nimprovements or modifications to such\ntechnology systems and models, could cause us\nto be unable to market and manage our products\nand services, manage our risk, meet our\nregulatory obligations or report our financial\nresults in a timely and accurate manner, all\nof which could have a negative impact on our\nresults of operations. In addition, our\nongoing investments in infrastructure, which\nare necessary to maintain a competitive\nbusiness, integrate acquisitions and establish\nscalable operations, may increase our\nexpenses. As our business develops, changes or\nexpands, additional expenses can arise as a\nresult of a reevaluation of business\nstrategies, management of outsourced services,\nasset purchases or other acquisitions,\nstructural reorganization, compliance with new\nlaws or regulations, the integration of newly\nacquired businesses, or the prevention or\noccurrence of cyber-attacks and other security\nincidents. If we are unable to successfully\nmanage our expenses, our financial results\nwill be negatively affected. Changes to our\nbusiness, including those resulting from our\nstrategic objectives, also requires robust\ngovernance to ensure that our objectives are\nexecuted as intended without adversely\nimpacting our customers, associates,\noperations or financial performance.\nIneffective change management oversight and\ngovernance over the execution of our strategic\nobjectives could expose us to operational,\nstrategic and reputational risk and could\nnegatively impact customers or our financial\nperformance.\n\nA cyber-attack or other security incident,\nincluding one that results in the theft, loss\nor misuse of information (including personal\ninformation), or the disabling of systems and\naccess to information critical to business\noperations, may result in increased costs,\nreductions in revenue, reputational damage,\nlegal exposure and business disruptions.\n\nOur ability to provide our products and\nservices, many of which are web-based, and\ncommunicate with our customers, depends upon\nthe management and safeguarding of information\nsystems and infrastructure, networks,\nsoftware, data engineering, technology,\nmethodologies and business secrets, including\nthose of our service providers. Our products\nand services involve the collection,\nauthentication, management, usage, storage,\ntransmission and eventual destruction of\nsensitive and confidential information,\nincluding personal information, regarding our\ncustomers and their accounts, our employees,\nour partners and other\n                                              \n  27    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nthird parties with which we do business. We\nalso have arrangements in place with third\nparties through which we share and receive\ninformation about their customers who are or\nmay become our customers.\n\nTechnologies, systems, networks, and other\ndevices of Capital One, as well as those of\nour employees, service providers, partners and\nother third parties with whom we interact,\nhave been and may continue to be the subject\nof cyber-attacks and other security incidents,\nincluding DDOS attacks, computer viruses,\nhacking, malware, ransomware, credential\nstuffing, or phishing or other forms of social\nengineering. Such cyber-attacks and other\nsecurity incidents are designed to lead to\nvarious harmful outcomes, such as unauthorized\ntransactions in Capital One accounts,\nunauthorized or unintended access to or\nrelease, gathering, monitoring, disclosure,\nloss, destruction, corruption, disablement,\nencryption, misuse, modification or other\nprocessing of confidential or sensitive\ninformation (including personal information),\nintellectual property, software, methodologies\nor business secrets, disruption, sabotage or\ndegradation of service, systems or networks,\nor other damage. These threats may derive\nfrom, among other things, error, fraud or\nmalice on the part of our employees, insiders,\nor third parties or may result from accidental\ntechnological failure. Any of these parties\nmay also attempt to fraudulently induce\nemployees, service providers, customers,\npartners or other third-party users of our\nsystems or networks to disclose confidential\nor sensitive information (including personal\ninformation) in order to gain access to our\nsystems, networks or data or that of our\ncustomers, partners, or third parties with\nwhom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or\notherwise improper payment. For example, any\nparty that obtains our confidential or\nsensitive information (including personal\ninformation) through a cyber-attack or other\nsecurity incident may use this information for\nransom, to be paid by us or a third party, as\npart of a fraudulent activity that is part of\na broader criminal activity, or for other\nillicit purposes.\n\nFor example, on July 29, 2019, we announced\nthat on March 22 and 23, 2019 an outside\nindividual gained unauthorized access to our\nsystems (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d). This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers. While the Cybersecurity\nIncident has been remediated, it has resulted\nin fines, litigation, government\ninvestigations and other regulatory\nenforcement inquiries, as well as consent\norders with certain regulatory agencies. Cyber\nand information security risks for large\nfinancial institutions like us continue to\nincrease due to the proliferation of new\ntechnologies, the industry-wide shift to\nreliance upon the internet to conduct\nfinancial transactions, and the increased\nsophistication and activities of malicious\nactors, organized crime, perpetrators of\nfraud, hackers, terrorists, activists, formal\nand informal instrumentalities of foreign\ngovernments and other external parties. In\naddition, our customers access our products\nand services using personal devices that are\nnecessarily external to our security control\nsystems. There has also been a significant\nproliferation of consumer information\navailable on the internet resulting from\nbreaches of third-party entities, including\npersonal information, log-in credentials and\nauthentication data. While we were not\ndirectly involved in these third-party breach\nevents, the stolen information can create a\nvulnerability for our customers if their\nCapital One log-in credentials are the same as\nor similar to the credentials that have been\ncompromised on other sites. This vulnerability\ncould include the risk of unauthorized account\naccess, data loss and fraud. The use of\nartificial intelligence, \u201cbots\u201d or other\nautomation software can increase the velocity\nand efficacy of these types of attacks. The\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic also increases the\nrisk that we may experience cyber incidents as\na result of our employees, service providers,\npartners and other third parties with which we\ninteract working remotely on systems, networks\nand environments over which we have less\ncontrol.\n\nThe methods and techniques employed by\nmalicious actors change frequently, are\nincreasingly sophisticated and often are not\nfully recognized or understood until after\nthey have occurred, and some techniques could\noccur and persist for an extended period of\ntime before being detected. For example,\nalthough we immediately fixed the\nconfiguration vulnerability that was exploited\nin the Cybersecurity Incident once we\ndiscovered the unauthorized access, a period\nof time elapsed between the occurrence of the\nunauthorized access and the time when we\ndiscovered it. In other circumstances, we and\nour service providers and other third parties\nwith which we interact may be unable to\nanticipate or identify certain attack methods\nin order to implement effective preventative\nmeasures or mitigate or remediate the damages\ncaused in a timely manner. We may also be\nunable to hire and develop talent capable of\ndetecting, mitigating or remediating these\nrisks. Although we seek to maintain a robust\nsuite of authentication and layered\ninformation security controls, any one or\ncombination of these controls could fail to\ndetect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a\ntimely manner. We will likely face an\nincreasing number of attempted cyber-attacks\nas we expand our mobile and other internet-\nbased products and services, as well as our\nusage of mobile and cloud technologies and as\nwe provide more of these services to a greater\nnumber of retail clients.\n\nA disruption or breach, including as a result\nof a cyber-attack such as the Cybersecurity\nIncident, or media reports of perceived\nsecurity vulnerabilities at Capital One or at\nour service providers, could result in\nsignificant legal and financial exposure,\nregulatory intervention, litigation,\nremediation costs, card reissuance,\nsupervisory liability, damage to our\nreputation or loss of confidence in the\nsecurity of our systems, products and services\nthat could adversely affect our business.\nThere can be no assurance that unauthorized\naccess or cyber incidents similar to the\nCybersecurity Incident will not occur or that\nwe will not\n                                              \n  28    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nsuffer material losses in the future. If\nfuture attacks are successful or if customers\nare unable to access their accounts online for\nother reasons, it could adversely impact our\nability to service customer accounts or loans,\ncomplete financial transactions for our\ncustomers or otherwise operate any of our\nbusinesses or services. In addition, a breach\nor attack affecting one of our service\nproviders or other third parties with which we\ninteract could harm our business even if we do\nnot control the service that is attacked.\n\nFurther, our ability to monitor our service\nproviders\u2019 cybersecurity practices is limited.\nAlthough we generally have agreements relating\nto cybersecurity and data privacy in place\nwith our service providers, we cannot\nguarantee that such agreements will prevent a\ncyber incident impacting our systems or\ninformation or enable us to obtain adequate or\nany reimbursement from our service providers\nin the event we should suffer any such\nincidents. However, due to applicable laws and\nregulations or contractual obligations, we may\nbe held responsible for cyber incidents\nattributed to our service providers as they\nrelate to the information we share with them.\n\nIn addition, the increasing prevalence and the\nevolution of cyber-attacks and other efforts\nto breach or disrupt our systems or networks\nor those of our customers, service providers,\npartners or other third parties with which we\ninteract has led, and will likely continue to\nlead, to increased costs to us with respect to\npreventing, mitigating and remediating these\nrisks, as well as any related attempted fraud.\nIn order to address ongoing and future risks,\nwe must expend significant resources to\nsupport protective security measures,\ninvestigate and remediate any vulnerabilities\nof our information systems and infrastructure\nand invest in new technology designed to\nmitigate security risks. Further, high profile\ncyber incidents at Capital One or other large\nfinancial institutions could lead to a general\nloss of customer confidence in financial\ninstitutions that could negatively affect us,\nincluding harming the market perception of the\neffectiveness of our security measures or the\nfinancial system in general, which could\nresult in reduced use of our financial\nproducts. We have insurance against some cyber\nrisks and attacks; nonetheless, our insurance\ncoverage may not be sufficient to offset the\nimpact of a material loss event (including if\nour insurer denies coverage as to any\nparticular claim in the future), and such\ninsurance may increase in cost or cease to be\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, or\nat all, in the future.\n\nOur required compliance with applicable laws\nand regulations related to privacy, data\nprotection and data security may increase our\ncosts, reduce our revenue, increase our legal\nexposure and limit our ability to pursue\nbusiness opportunities.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of continuously\nevolving and developing laws and regulations\nin the United States at the federal, state and\nlocal level regarding privacy, data protection\nand data security, including those related to\nthe collection, storage, handling, use,\ndisclosure, transfer, security and other\nprocessing of personal information. For\nexample, at the federal level, we are subject\nto the GLBA, among other laws and regulations.\nIn addition, in November 2021, the Federal\nReserve, OCC, and FDIC issued a final rule\nthat, among other things, requires all banking\norganizations in the United States to notify\ntheir primary federal regulators of certain\nmaterial computer-security incidents as soon\nas possible and no later than 36 hours after\ndetermining that the incident has occurred. At\nthe state level, the CCPA went into effect on\nJanuary 1, 2020 and covers certain companies\nthat process personal information of\nCalifornia residents. The CCPA was recently\namended by the CPRA, which will become\neffective in most material respects on January\n1, 2023. Numerous other states have also\nenacted or are in the process of enacting\nstate-level privacy, data protection and/or\ndata security laws and regulations.\n\nWe also are, or may become, subject to\ncontinuously evolving and developing laws and\nregulations in other jurisdictions regarding\nprivacy, data protection and data security.\nFor example, in Canada we are subject to the\nPersonal Information Protection and Electronic\nDocuments Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d). In addition, the EU\nGDPR applies EU data protection law to all\ncompanies processing data of EU residents,\nregardless of the company\u2019s location. We also\nare subject to the U.K. GDPR (which is how\nGDPR has been implemented into U.K. law).\nThese laws and regulations, and similar laws\nand regulations in other jurisdictions, impose\nstrict requirements regarding the collection,\nstorage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer,\nsecurity and other processing of personal\ninformation, which may have adverse\nconsequences, including significant compliance\ncosts and severe monetary penalties for non-\ncompliance. Significant uncertainty exists as\nprivacy, data protection, and data security\nlaws may be interpreted and applied\ndifferently from country to country and may\ncreate inconsistent or conflicting\nrequirements.\n\nFurther, we make public statements about our\nuse, collection, disclosure and other\nprocessing of personal information through our\nprivacy policies, information provided on our\nwebsite and press statements. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our public statements\nand documentation, we may at times fail to do\nso or be alleged to have failed to do so. The\npublication of our privacy policies and other\nstatements that provide promises and\nassurances about privacy, data protection and\ndata security can subject us to potential\ngovernment or legal action if they are found\nto be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative\nof our actual practices.\n                                              \n  29    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nOur efforts to comply with PIPEDA, GLBA, GDPR,\nU.K. GDPR, CCPA, CPRA and other privacy, data\nprotection and data security laws and\nregulations, as well as our posted privacy\npolicies, and related contractual obligations\nto third parties, entail substantial expenses,\nmay divert resources from other initiatives\nand projects, and could limit the services we\nare able to offer. Furthermore, enforcement\nactions and investigations by regulatory\nauthorities related to data security incidents\nand privacy, data protection and data security\nviolations continue to increase. The enactment\nof more restrictive laws or regulations, or\nfuture enforcement actions or investigations,\ncould impact us through increased costs or\nrestrictions on our business, and any\nnoncompliance or perceived noncompliance could\nresult in monetary or other penalties, harm to\nour reputation and significant legal\nliability.\nWe face risks resulting from the extensive use\nof models and data.\nWe rely on quantitative models, our ability to\nmanage and aggregate data in an accurate and\ntimely manner, assess and manage our various\nrisk exposures, estimate certain financial\nvalues and manage compliance with regulatory\ncapital requirements. Models may be used in\nsuch processes as determining the pricing of\nvarious products, grading loans and extending\ncredit, measuring interest rate and other\nmarket risks, predicting deposit levels or\nloan losses, assessing capital adequacy and\ncalculating managerial and regulatory capital\nlevels, estimating the value of financial\ninstruments and balance sheet items, and other\noperational functions. Our risk reporting and\nmanagement, including business decisions based\non information incorporating models, depend on\nthe effectiveness of our models and our\npolicies, programs, processes and practices\ngoverning how data is acquired, validated,\nstored, protected, processed and analyzed. Any\nissues with the quality or effectiveness of\nour data aggregation and validation\nprocedures, as well as the quality and\nintegrity of data inputs, formulas or\nalgorithms, could result in inaccurate\nforecasts, ineffective risk management\npractices or inaccurate risk reporting. In\naddition, models based on historical data sets\nmight not be accurate predictors of future\noutcomes and their ability to appropriately\npredict future outcomes may degrade over time.\nWhile we continuously update our policies,\nprograms, processes and practices, many of our\ndata management, aggregation and\nimplementation processes are manual and\nsubject to human error or system failure.\nFailure to manage data effectively and to\naggregate data in an accurate and timely\nmanner may limit our ability to manage current\nand emerging risk, to produce accurate\nfinancial, regulatory and operational\nreporting as well as to manage changing\nbusiness needs. If our risk management\nframework is ineffective, we could suffer\nunexpected losses which could materially\nadversely affect our results of operation or\nfinancial condition. Also, any information we\nprovide to the public or to our regulators\nbased on poorly designed or implemented models\ncould be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the\ndecisions that our regulators make, including\nthose related to capital distribution to our\nstockholders, could be affected adversely due\nto the perception that the quality of the\nmodels used to generate the relevant\ninformation is insufficient.\n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Risk                   \n                                              \nCompliance with new and existing laws,\nregulations and regulatory expectations is\ncostly and complex.\nA wide array of laws and regulations,\nincluding banking and consumer lending laws\nand regulations, apply to almost every aspect\nof our business. We and our subsidiaries are\nalso subject to supervision and examination by\nmultiple regulators, and the manner in which\nour regulators interpret applicable laws and\nregulations may affect how we comply with\nthem. Failure to comply with these laws and\nregulations, even if the failure was\ninadvertent or reflects a difference in\ninterpretation, could subject us to\nrestrictions on our business activities,\nfines, criminal sanctions and other penalties,\nand/or damage to our reputation with\nregulators, our customers or the public.\nHiring, training and retaining qualified\ncompliance and legal personnel, and\nestablishing and maintaining risk management\nand compliance-related systems, infrastructure\nand processes, is difficult and may lead to\nincreased expenses. These efforts and the\nassociated costs could limit our ability to\ninvest in other business opportunities.\n\nApplicable rules and regulations may affect us\ndisproportionately compared to our competitors\nor in an unforeseen manner. For example, we\nhave a large number of customer accounts in\nour credit card and auto lending businesses\nand we have made the strategic choice to\noriginate and service subprime credit card and\nauto loans, which typically have higher\ndelinquencies and charge-offs than prime\ncustomer accounts. As a result, we have\nsignificant involvement with credit bureau\nreporting and the collection and recovery of\ndelinquent and charged-off debt, primarily\nthrough customer communications, the filing of\nlitigation against customers in default, the\nperiodic sale of charged-off debt and vehicle\nrepossession. These activities are subject to\nenhanced legal and regulatory scrutiny from\nregulators, courts and legislators. Any future\nchanges to or legal liabilities resulting from\nour business practices in these areas,\nincluding our debt collection practices,\nwhether mandated by regulators, courts,\nlegislators or otherwise, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our financial\ncondition.\n                                              \n  30    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe legislative and regulatory environment is\nbeyond our control, may change rapidly and\nunpredictably, and may negatively influence\nour revenue, costs, earnings, growth,\nliquidity and capital levels. For example,\nthere may be future rulemaking in emerging\nregulatory areas such as climate-related risks\nand new technologies, including distributed\nledger technology and cryptocurrencies. In\naddition, some rules and regulations may be\nsubject to litigation or other challenges that\ndelay or modify their implementation and\nimpact on us. Adoption of new technologies,\nsuch as distributed ledger technologies,\ntokenization, cloud computing, artificial\nintelligence and machine learning\ntechnologies, can present unforeseen\nchallenges in applying and relying on existing\ncompliance systems.\n\nCertain laws and regulations, and any\ninterpretations and applications with respect\nthereto, are generally intended to protect\nconsumers, borrowers, depositors, the DIF, the\nU.S. banking and financial system, and\nfinancial markets as a whole, but not\nstockholders. Our success depends on our\nability to maintain compliance with both\nexisting and new laws and regulations. For a\ndescription of the material laws and\nregulations to which we are subject, see \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation.\u201d\nOur businesses are subject to the risk of\nincreased litigation, government\ninvestigations and regulatory enforcement.\nOur businesses are subject to increased\nlitigation, government investigations and\nother regulatory enforcement risks as a result\nof a number of factors and from various\nsources, including the highly regulated nature\nof the financial services industry, the focus\nof state and federal prosecutors on banks and\nthe financial services industry and the\nstructure of the credit card industry.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties involved in\nlitigation, government investigations and\nregulatory enforcement decisions, and the very\nlarge or indeterminate damages sought in some\nmatters asserted against us, there can be\nsignificant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these kinds of\nmatters. The finding, or even the assertion,\nof substantial legal liability against us\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial condition and could\ncause significant reputational harm to us,\nwhich could seriously harm our business. The\nCybersecurity Incident has resulted in\nlitigation, government investigations and\nother regulatory enforcement inquiries.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions, such as\nourselves, face significant regulatory\nscrutiny, which can lead to public enforcement\nactions or nonpublic supervisory actions. We\nand our subsidiaries are subject to\ncomprehensive regulation and periodic\nexamination by, among other regulatory bodies,\nthe Federal Banking Agencies, SEC, CFTC and\nCFPB. We have been subject to enforcement\nactions by many of these and other regulators\nand may continue to be involved in such\nactions, including governmental inquiries,\ninvestigations and enforcement proceedings,\nincluding by the OCC, Department of Justice,\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(\u201cFinCEN\u201d) and state Attorneys General.\n\nOver the last several years, federal and state\nregulators have focused on compliance with AML\nand sanctions laws, privacy, data protection\nand data security, use of service providers,\nfair lending and other consumer protection\nissues. In August 2020, we entered into\nconsent orders with the Federal Reserve and\nthe OCC resulting from regulatory reviews of\nthe Cybersecurity Incident and relating to\nongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and\noperational risk management processes, and we\npaid a civil monetary penalty as part of the\nOCC agreement. In January 2021, we also paid a\ncivil monetary penalty assessed by FinCEN\nagainst CONA in connection with our AML\nprogram. Regulatory scrutiny is expected to\ncontinue in these areas, including as a result\nof implementation of the AML Act of 2020.\n\nWe expect that regulators and governmental\nenforcement bodies will continue taking formal\nenforcement actions against financial\ninstitutions in addition to addressing\nsupervisory concerns through nonpublic\nsupervisory and enforcement actions or\nfindings, which could involve restrictions on\nour activities, or our ability to make\nacquisitions or otherwise expand our business,\namong other limitations that could adversely\naffect our business. In addition, a violation\nof law or regulation by another financial\ninstitution is likely to give rise to an\ninvestigation by regulators and other\ngovernmental agencies of the same or similar\npractices by us. Furthermore, a single event\nmay give rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings. These and\nother initiatives from governmental\nauthorities and officials may subject us to\nfurther judgments, settlements, fines or\npenalties, or cause us to restructure our\noperations and activities or to cease offering\ncertain products or services, all of which\ncould harm our reputation or lead to higher\noperational costs. Litigation, government\ninvestigations and other regulatory actions\ncould generally subject us to significant\nfines, increased expenses, restrictions on our\nactivities and damage to our reputation and\nour brand, and could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations. For additional information\nregarding legal and regulatory proceedings to\nwhich we are subject, see \u201cNote\n18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and\nOthers.\u201d\n                                              \n  31    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   Other Business Risks                       \n                                              \nWe face intense competition in all of our\nmarkets.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment\nacross all of our lines of business, whether\nin making loans, attracting deposits or in the\nglobal payments industry, and we expect\ncompetitive conditions to continue to\nintensify with respect to most of our products\nparticularly in our credit card and consumer\nbanking business. We compete on the basis of\nthe rates we pay on deposits and the rates and\nother terms we charge on the loans we\noriginate or purchase, as well as the quality\nand range of our customer service, products,\ninnovation and experience. This increasingly\ncompetitive environment is primarily a result\nof changes in technology, product delivery\nsystems and regulation, as well as the\nemergence of new or significantly larger\nfinancial services providers, all of which may\naffect our customers\u2019 expectations and\ndemands. In addition to offering competitive\nproducts and services, we invest in and\nconduct marketing campaigns to attract and\ninform customers.\n\nSome of our competitors, including new and\nemerging competitors in the digital and mobile\npayments space and other financial technology\nproviders, are not subject to the same\nregulatory requirements or legislative\nscrutiny to which we are subject, which also\ncould place us at a competitive disadvantage,\nin particular in the development of new\ntechnology platforms or the ability to rapidly\ninnovate. We compete with many forms of\npayments offered by both bank and non-bank\nproviders, including a variety of new and\nevolving alternative payment mechanisms,\nsystems and products, such as aggregators and\nweb-based and wireless payment platforms or\ntechnologies, digital or cryptocurrencies,\nprepaid systems and payment services targeting\nusers of social networks, communications\nplatforms and online gaming. If we are unable\nto continue to keep pace with innovation, do\nnot effectively market our products and\nservices or are prohibited from or unwilling\nto enter emerging areas of competition, our\nbusiness and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\n\nSome of our competitors are substantially\nlarger than we are, which may give those\ncompetitors advantages, including a more\ndiversified product and customer base, the\nability to reach more customers and potential\ncustomers, operational efficiencies, broad-\nbased local distribution capabilities, lower-\ncost funding and larger existing branch\nnetworks. Many of our competitors are also\nfocusing on cross-selling their products and\ndeveloping new products or technologies, which\ncould affect our ability to maintain or grow\nexisting customer relationships or require us\nto offer lower interest rates or fees on our\nlending products or higher interest rates on\ndeposits. Competition for loans could result\nin origination of fewer loans, earning less on\nour loans or an increase in loans that perform\nbelow expectations.\n\nWe operate as an online direct bank in the\nUnited States. While direct banking provides a\nsignificant opportunity to attract new\ncustomers that value greater and more flexible\naccess to banking services at reduced costs,\nwe face strong and increasing competition in\nthe direct banking market. Aggressive pricing\nthroughout the industry may adversely affect\nthe retention of existing balances and the\ncost-efficient acquisition of new deposit\nfunds and may affect our growth and\nprofitability. Customers could also close\ntheir online accounts or reduce balances or\ndeposits in favor of products and services\noffered by competitors for other reasons.\nThese shifts, which could be rapid, could\nresult from general dissatisfaction with our\nproducts or services, including concerns over\npricing, online security or our reputation.\nThe potential consequences of this competitive\nenvironment are exacerbated by the flexibility\nof direct banking and the financial and\ntechnological sophistication of our online\ncustomer base.\n\nIn our credit card business, competition for\nrewards customers may result in higher rewards\nexpenses, or we may fail to attract new\ncustomers or retain existing rewards customers\ndue to increasing competition for these\nconsumers. As of December 31, 2021, we have a\nnumber of large partnerships in our credit\ncard loan portfolio. The market for key\nbusiness partners, especially in the credit\ncard business, is very competitive, and we may\nnot be able to grow or maintain these partner\nrelationships. Additionally, partners\nthemselves may face changes in their business,\nincluding market factors and ownership\nchanges, that could impact the partnership. We\nface the risk that we could lose partner\nrelationships, even after we have invested\nsignificant resources into acquiring and\ndeveloping the relationships. The loss of any\nof our key business partners could have a\nnegative impact on our results of operations,\nincluding lower returns, excess operating\nexpense and excess funding capacity.\n\nWe depend on our partners to effectively\npromote our co-brand and private label\nproducts and integrate the use of our credit\ncards into their retail operations. The\nfailure by our partners to effectively promote\nand support our products as well as changes\nthey may make in their business models could\nadversely affect card usage and our ability to\nachieve the growth and profitability\nobjectives of our partnerships. In addition,\nif our partners do not adhere to the terms of\nour program agreements and standards, or\notherwise diminish the value of our brand, we\nmay suffer reputational damage and customers\nmay be less likely to use our products.\n                                              \n  32    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may\ndevelop, substantially greater financial and\nother resources than we have, may offer richer\nvalue propositions or a wider range of\nprograms and services than we offer, or may\nuse more effective advertising, marketing or\ncross-selling strategies to acquire and retain\nmore customers, capture a greater share of\nspending and borrowings, attain and develop\nmore attractive co-brand card programs and\nmaintain greater merchant acceptance than we\nhave. We may not be able to compete\neffectively against these threats or respond\nor adapt to changes in consumer spending\nhabits as effectively as our competitors.\n\nIn such a competitive environment, we may lose\nentire accounts or may lose account balances\nto competing firms, or we may find it more\ncostly to maintain our existing customer base.\nCustomer attrition from any or all of our\nlending products, together with any lowering\nof interest rates or fees that we might\nimplement to retain customers, could reduce\nour revenues and therefore our earnings.\nSimilarly, unexpected customer attrition from\nour deposit products, in addition to an\nincrease in rates or services that we may\noffer to retain deposits, may increase our\nexpenses and therefore reduce our earnings.\n\nOur business, financial condition and results\nof operations may be adversely affected by\nmerchants\u2019 increasing focus on the fees\ncharged by credit and debit card networks and\nby legislation and regulation impacting such\nfees.\n\nInterchange fees are generally one of the\nlargest components of the costs that merchants\npay in connection with the acceptance of\ncredit and debit cards and are a meaningful\nsource of revenue for our credit and debit\ncard businesses. Interchange fees are the\nsubject of significant and intense global\nlegal, legislative and regulatory focus, and\nthe resulting decisions, legislation and\nregulation may have a material adverse impact\non our overall business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\n\nLegislative and regulatory bodies in a number\nof countries are seeking to reduce interchange\nfees through legislation, competition-related\nregulatory proceedings, voluntary agreements,\ncentral bank regulation and/or litigation. For\ncredit transactions, interchange reimbursement\nrates in the United States are set by credit\ncard networks such as MasterCard and Visa. For\ndebit transactions, Federal Reserve rules\nplace limits on the interchange fees we may\ncharge. For more information on these rules,\nincluding the Federal Reserve\u2019s proposed\namendments, please see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation.\u201d In some\njurisdictions, such as Canada and certain\ncountries in Europe, including the U.K.,\ninterchange fees and related practices are\nsubject to regulatory activity, including in\nsome cases, imposing caps on permissible\ninterchange fees. Our international card\nbusinesses have been impacted by these\nrestrictions. For example, in the U.K.,\ninterchange fees are capped for both credit\nand debit card transactions. In addition, in\nCanada, Visa and Mastercard payment networks\nhave, since 2014, entered into voluntary\nagreements with the Department of Finance\nCanada to maintain an agreed upon average\ninterchange rate. Lowering interchange fees\nremains an area of domestic and international\ngovernmental focus. Legislators and regulators\naround the world are aware of each other\u2019s\napproaches to the regulation of the payments\nindustry. Consequently, a development in one\ncountry, state or region may influence\nregulatory approaches in another, such as our\nprimary market, the United States.\n\nIn addition to this regulatory activity,\nmerchants are also seeking avenues to reduce\ninterchange fees. During the past few years,\nmerchants and their trade groups have filed\nnumerous lawsuits against Visa, MasterCard,\nAmerican Express and their card-issuing banks,\nclaiming that their practices toward\nmerchants, including interchange and similar\nfees, violate federal antitrust laws. In 2005,\na number of entities filed antitrust lawsuits\nagainst MasterCard and Visa and several member\nbanks, including our subsidiaries and us,\nalleging among other things, that the\ndefendants conspired to fix the level of\ninterchange fees. In December 2013, the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork granted final approval of the proposed\nclass settlement. The settlement provided,\namong other things, that merchants would be\nentitled to join together to negotiate lower\ninterchange fees. The settlement was appealed\nto the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which\nrejected the settlement in June 2016; a\nrevised settlement was reached in the second\nhalf of 2018, and the trial court issued its\nfinal approval of the settlement in December\n2019. See \u201cNote 18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies,\nGuarantees and Others\u201d for further details.\n\nSome major retailers may have sufficient\nbargaining power to independently negotiate\nlower interchange fees with MasterCard and\nVisa, which could, in turn, result in lower\ninterchange fees for us when our cardholders\nundertake purchase transactions with these\nretailers. In 2016, some of the largest\nmerchants individually negotiated lower\ninterchange rates with MasterCard and/or Visa.\nThese and other merchants also continue to\nlobby aggressively for caps and restrictions\non interchange fees and their efforts may be\nsuccessful or they may in the future bring\nlegal proceedings against us or other credit\ncard and debit card issuers and networks.\n\nBeyond pursuing litigation, legislation and\nregulation, merchants may also promote forms\nof payment with lower fees, such as ACH-based\npayments, or seek to impose surcharges at the\npoint of sale for use of credit or debit\ncards. New payment systems, particularly\nmobile-based payment technologies, could also\ngain widespread adoption and lead to issuer\ntransaction fees or the displacement of credit\ncard accounts as a payment method.\n                                              \n  33    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe heightened focus by merchants and\nlegislative and regulatory bodies on the fees\ncharged by credit and debit card networks, and\nthe ability of certain merchants to\nsuccessfully negotiate discounts to\ninterchange fees with MasterCard and Visa or\ndevelop alternative payment systems, could\nresult in a reduction of interchange fees. Any\nresulting loss in income to us could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in\nand introduce digital and other technological\ndevelopments across all our businesses, our\nfinancial performance may suffer.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and\nsignificant technological changes and our\nability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and\nexpectations is key to our ability to grow\nrevenue and earnings. We expect digital\ntechnologies to have a significant impact on\nbanking over time. Consumers expect robust\ndigital experiences from their financial\nservices providers. The ability for customers\nto access their accounts and conduct financial\ntransactions using digital technology,\nincluding mobile applications, is an important\naspect of the financial services industry and\nfinancial institutions are rapidly introducing\nnew digital and other technology-driven\nproducts and services that aim to offer a\nbetter customer experience and to reduce\ncosts. We continue to invest in digital\ntechnology designed to attract new customers,\nfacilitate the ability of existing customers\nto conduct financial transactions and enhance\nthe customer experience related to our\nproducts and services.\n\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon\nour ability to address the needs of our\ncustomers by using digital technology to\nprovide products and services that meet their\nexpectations. The development and launch of\nnew digital products and services depends in\nlarge part on our capacity to invest in and\nbuild the technology platforms that can enable\nthem, in a cost effective and timely manner.\nSee \u201c We face intense competition in all of\nour markets \u201d and \u201c We face risks related to\nour operational, technological and\norganizational infrastructure. \u201d\n\nSome of our competitors are substantially\nlarger than we are, which may allow those\ncompetitors to invest more money into their\ntechnology infrastructure and digital\ninnovation than we do. In addition, we face\nintense competition from smaller companies\nwhich experience lower cost structures and\ndifferent regulatory requirements and scrutiny\nthan we do, and which may allow them to\ninnovate more rapidly than we can. See \u201c We\nface intense competition in all of our\nmarkets. \u201d Further, our success depends on our\nability to attract and retain strong digital\nand technology leaders, engineers and other\nspecialized personnel. The competition is\nintense and the compensation costs continue to\nincrease for such talent. If we are unable to\nattract and retain digital and technology\ntalent, our ability to offer digital products\nand services and build the necessary\ntechnology infrastructure could be negatively\naffected, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results. A failure to\nmaintain or enhance our competitive position\nwith respect to digital products and services,\nwhether because we fail to anticipate customer\nexpectations or because our technological\ndevelopments fail to perform as desired or are\nnot implemented in a timely or successful\nmanner, could negatively impact our business\nand financial results.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of our mergers, acquisitions and\nstrategic partnerships.\nWe have engaged in merger and acquisition\nactivity and entered into strategic\npartnerships over the past several years. We\ncontinue to evaluate and anticipate engaging\nin, among other merger and acquisition\nactivity, additional strategic partnerships\nand selected acquisitions of financial\ninstitutions and other businesses or assets,\nincluding credit card and other loan\nportfolios. We may not be able to identify and\nsecure future acquisition targets on terms and\nconditions that are acceptable to us, or\nsuccessfully complete within the anticipated\ntime frame and achieve the anticipated\nbenefits of proposed mergers, acquisitions and\nstrategic partnerships, which could impair our\ngrowth.\n\nAny merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership we undertake entails certain\nrisks, which may materially and adversely\naffect our results of operations. If we\nexperience greater than anticipated costs to\nintegrate acquired businesses into our\nexisting operations, or are not able to\nachieve the anticipated benefits of any\nmerger, acquisition or strategic partnership,\nincluding cost savings and other synergies,\nour business could be negatively affected. In\naddition, it is possible that the ongoing\nintegration processes could result in the loss\nof key employees, errors or delays in systems\nimplementation, exposure to cybersecurity\nrisks associated with acquired businesses,\nexposure to additional regulatory oversight,\nthe disruption of our ongoing businesses or\ninconsistencies in standards, controls,\nprocedures and policies that adversely affect\nour ability to maintain relationships with\npartners, clients, customers, depositors and\nemployees or to achieve the anticipated\nbenefits of any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership. Integration efforts\nalso may divert management attention and\nresources. These integration matters may have\nan adverse effect on us during any transition\nperiod.\n                                              \n  34    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, we may face the following risks\nin connection with any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership:\n\n\u2022 New Businesses and Geographic or Other\nMarkets: Our merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership activity may involve our entry\ninto new businesses, or new geographic areas\nor other markets which present risks resulting\nfrom our relative inexperience in these new\nbusinesses or markets. These new businesses or\nmarkets may change the overall character of\nour consolidated portfolio of businesses and\nalter our exposure to economic and other\nexternal factors. We face the risk that we\nwill not be successful in these new businesses\nor in these new markets.\n\n\u2022 Identification and Assessment of Merger and\nAcquisition Targets and Deployment of Acquired\nAssets: We may not be able to identify,\nacquire or partner with suitable targets.\nFurther, our ability to achieve the\nanticipated benefits of any merger,\nacquisition or strategic partnership will\ndepend on our ability to assess the asset\nquality and value of the particular assets or\ninstitutions we partner with, merge with or\nacquire. We may be unable to profitably deploy\nany assets we acquire.\n\n\u2022 Accuracy of Assumptions: In connection with\nany merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership, we may make certain assumptions\nrelating to the proposed merger, acquisition\nor strategic partnership that may be, or may\nprove to be, inaccurate, including as a result\nof the failure to realize the expected\nbenefits of any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership. The inaccuracy of any\nassumptions we may make could result in\nunanticipated consequences that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of\noperations or financial condition.\n\n\u2022 Target-specific Risk: Assets and companies\nthat we acquire, or companies that we enter\ninto strategic partnerships with, will have\ntheir own risks that are specific to a\nparticular asset or company. These risks\ninclude, but are not limited to, particular or\nspecific regulatory, accounting, operational,\nreputational and industry risks, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nFor example, we may face challenges associated\nwith integrating other companies due to\ndifferences in corporate culture, compliance\nsystems or standards of conduct.\nIndemnification rights, if any, may be\ninsufficient to compensate us for any losses\nor damages resulting from such risks. In\naddition to regulatory approvals discussed\nbelow, certain of our merger, acquisition or\npartnership activity may require third-party\nconsents in order for us to fully realize the\nanticipated benefits of any such transaction.\n\n\u2022 Conditions to Regulatory Approval: We may be\nrequired to obtain regulatory approvals to\nconsummate certain acquisitions. We cannot be\ncertain whether, when or on what terms and\nconditions, such approvals may be granted.\nConsequently, we may not obtain regulatory\napproval for a proposed acquisition on\nacceptable terms or at all, in which case we\nwould not be able to complete the acquisition\ndespite investing resources in pursuing it.\nReputational risk and social factors may\nimpact our results and damage our brand.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers is\nhighly dependent upon the perceptions of\nconsumer and commercial borrowers and deposit\nholders and other external perceptions of our\nproducts, services, trustworthiness, business\npractices, workplace culture, compliance\npractices or our financial health. In\naddition, our brand is very important to us.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand depends\nlargely on our ability to continue to provide\nhigh-quality products and services. Adverse\nperceptions regarding our reputation in the\nconsumer, commercial and funding markets could\nlead to difficulties in generating and\nmaintaining accounts as well as in financing\nthem. In particular, negative public\nperceptions regarding our reputation,\nincluding negative perceptions regarding our\nability to maintain the security of our\ntechnology systems and protect customer data,\ncould lead to decreases in the levels of\ndeposits that consumer and commercial\ncustomers and potential customers choose to\nmaintain with us or significantly increase the\ncosts of attracting and retaining customers.\nIn addition, negative perceptions regarding\ncertain industries, partners or clients could\nalso prompt us to cease business activities\nassociated with those entities.\n\nNegative public opinion or damage to our brand\ncould also result from actual or alleged\nconduct in any number of activities or\ncircumstances, including lending practices,\nregulatory compliance, security breaches\n(including the use and protection of customer\ndata, such as resulting from the Cybersecurity\nIncident), corporate governance and sales and\nmarketing, and from actions taken by\nregulators or other persons in response to\nsuch conduct. Such conduct could fall short of\nour customers\u2019 and the public\u2019s heightened\nexpectations of companies of our size with\nrigorous privacy, data protection, data\nsecurity and compliance practices, and could\nfurther harm our reputation. In addition, our\nco-brand and private label partners or other\nthird parties with whom we have important\nrelationships may take actions over which we\nhave limited control that could negatively\nimpact perceptions about us or the financial\nservices industry. The proliferation of social\nmedia may increase the likelihood that\nnegative public opinion from any of the events\ndiscussed above will impact our reputation and\nbusiness.\n                                              \n  35    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, a variety of social factors may\ncause changes in borrowing activity, including\ncredit card use, payment patterns and the rate\nof defaults by account holders and borrowers\ndomestically and internationally. These social\nfactors include changes in consumer confidence\nlevels, the public\u2019s perception regarding the\nbanking industry and consumer debt, including\ncredit card use, and changing attitudes about\nthe stigma of bankruptcy. If consumers develop\nor maintain negative attitudes about incurring\ndebt, or if consumption trends decline or if\nwe fail to maintain and enhance our brand, or\nwe incur significant expenses to do so, our\nbusiness and financial results could be\nmaterially and negatively affected.\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual\nproperty, our revenue and profitability could\nbe negatively affected.\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect\nand enhance our intellectual property,\nincluding copyrights, trademarks, trade\nsecrets, patents and certain restrictions on\ndisclosure, solicitation and competition. We\nalso undertake other measures to control\naccess to and distribution of our other\nproprietary information. These measures may\nnot prevent misappropriation of our\nproprietary information or infringement of our\nintellectual property rights and a resulting\nloss of competitive advantage. In addition,\nour competitors or other third parties may\nobtain patents for innovations that are used\nin our industry or allege that our systems,\nprocesses or technologies infringe on their\nintellectual property rights. If our\ncompetitors or other third parties are\nsuccessful in obtaining such patents or\nprevail in intellectual property-related\nlitigation against us, we could lose\nsignificant revenues, incur significant\nlicense, royalty or technology development\nexpenses, or pay significant damages.\n\nOur risk management strategies may not be\nfully effective in mitigating our risk\nexposures in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk.\n\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity,\noperational and compliance risk requires,\namong other things, policies and procedures to\nproperly record and verify a large number of\ntransactions and events. See \u201cMD&A\u2014Risk\nManagement\u201d for further details. Even though\nwe continue to devote significant resources to\ndeveloping our risk management framework, our\nrisk management strategies may not be fully\neffective in identifying and mitigating our\nrisk exposure in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk, including risks\nthat are unidentified or unanticipated.\n\nSome of our methods of managing these risks\nare based upon our use of observed historical\nmarket behavior and management\u2019s judgment.\nThese methods may not accurately predict\nfuture exposures, which could be significantly\ngreater than the historical measures indicate\nand market conditions, particularly during a\nperiod of financial market stress, can involve\nunprecedented dislocations. For example,\ncredit risk is inherent in the financial\nservices business and results from, among\nother things, extending credit to customers.\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of\nour customers may be impaired if the models\nand approaches we use to select, manage and\nunderwrite our consumer and commercial\ncustomers become less predictive of future\ncharge-offs due, for example, to rapid changes\nin the economy, or degradation in the\npredictive nature of credit bureau and other\ndata used in underwriting.\n\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of\nrisk monitoring and risk mitigation\ntechniques, those techniques and the judgments\nthat accompany their application cannot\nanticipate every economic and financial\noutcome or the timing of such outcomes. For\nexample, our ability to implement our risk\nmanagement strategies may be hindered by\nadverse changes in the volatility or liquidity\nconditions in certain markets and as a result,\nmay limit our ability to distribute such risks\n(for instance, when we seek to syndicate\nexposure in bridge financing transactions we\nhave underwritten). We may, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course of our risk management or\ninvesting activities.\n\nFluctuations in market interest rates or\nvolatility in the capital markets could\nadversely affect our income and expense, the\nvalue of assets and obligations, our\nregulatory capital, cost of capital or\nliquidity.\n\nLike other financial institutions, our\nbusiness is sensitive to market interest rate\nmovements and the performance of the capital\nmarkets. Disruptions, uncertainty or\nvolatility across the capital markets could\nnegatively impact market liquidity, limit our\naccess to the funding and capital required to\noperate and grow our business and adversely\naffect our results of operations and financial\ncondition. In addition, changes in interest\nrates or in valuations in the debt or equity\nmarkets could directly impact us. For example,\nwe borrow money from other institutions and\ndepositors, which we use to make loans to\ncustomers and invest in debt securities and\nother interest-earning assets. We earn\ninterest on these loans and assets and pay\ninterest on the money we borrow from\ninstitutions and depositors. The interest\nrates that we pay on the securities we have\nissued are also influenced by, among other\nthings, applicable credit ratings from\nrecognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any\nof these credit ratings could affect our\nability to access the capital markets,\nincrease our borrowing costs and have a\nnegative impact on our results of operations.\nIncreased charge-offs, rising interest rates\nand other events may cause our securitization\ntransactions to amortize earlier than\nscheduled, which could accelerate our need for\nadditional funding from other sources.\nFluctuations in interest rates,\n                                              \n  36    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nincluding changes in the relationship between\nshort-term rates and long-term rates and in\nthe relationship between our funding basis\nrate and our lending basis rate, may have\nnegative impacts on our net interest income\nand therefore our earnings.\n\nIn addition, interest rate fluctuations and\ncompetitor responses to those changes may\naffect the rate of customer prepayments for\nauto and other term loans and may affect the\nbalances customers carry on their credit\ncards. For example, increases in interest\nrates increase debt service requirements for\nsome of our borrowers, which may adversely\naffect those borrowers\u2019 ability to pay as\ncontractually obligated. This could result in\nadditional delinquencies or charge-offs and\nnegatively impact our results of operations.\nThese changes can reduce the overall yield on\nour interest-earning asset portfolio. Changes\nin interest rates and competitor responses to\nthese changes may also impact customer\ndecisions to maintain balances in the deposit\naccounts they have with us. An inability to\nattract or maintain deposits could materially\naffect our ability to fund our business and\nour liquidity position. Many other financial\ninstitutions have increased their reliance on\ndeposit funding and, as such, we expect\ncontinued competition in the deposit markets.\nWe cannot predict how this competition will\naffect our costs. If we are required to offer\nhigher interest rates to attract or maintain\ndeposits, our funding costs will be adversely\nimpacted. Changes in valuations in the debt\nand equity markets could have a negative\nimpact on the assets we hold in our investment\nportfolio. Such market changes could also have\na negative impact on the valuation of assets\nfor which we provide servicing.\n\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating\nthe effect on our earnings, economic value and\ncapital under various scenarios that differ\nbased on assumptions about the direction and\nthe magnitude of interest rate changes. We\ntake risk mitigation actions based on those\nassessments. We face the risk that changes in\ninterest rates could materially reduce our net\ninterest income and our earnings, especially\nif actual conditions turn out to be materially\ndifferent than those we assumed. See\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d for additional\ninformation.\nThe transition away from LIBOR may adversely\naffect our business.\nCentral banks around the world, including the\nFederal Reserve, have commissioned committees\nand working groups of market participants and\nofficial sector representatives to replace\nLIBOR and replace or reform other interest\nrate benchmarks. The publication of non-U.S.\ndollar LIBOR rates on a representative basis,\nas well as the publication of the lesser used\n1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors,\nceased as of the end of December 2021. While\nthe most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR\ntenors are expected to continue to be\npublished until June 30, 2023, the U.S.\nbanking agencies issued guidance that banking\norganizations should cease using U.S. dollar\nLIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts in\nany event by December 31, 2021. A transition\naway from the widespread use of LIBOR to\nalternative rates and other potential interest\nrate benchmark reforms has begun and is\ncontinuing. These reforms have caused and may\nin the future cause such rates to perform\ndifferently than in the past, or to disappear\nentirely, or have other consequences which\ncannot be predicted.\n\nGiven LIBOR\u2019s extensive use across financial\nmarkets, the transition away from LIBOR\npresents several risks and challenges to the\nfinancial markets and financial institutions,\nincluding Capital One. We have loans,\nderivative contracts, unsecured debt,\nsecuritizations, vendor agreements and other\ninstruments with attributes that are either\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.\nUncertainty as to the nature of potential\nchanges, alternative reference rates\n(including the pace of transition to, the\nspecific terms and parameters for, and market\nacceptance of, such rates), or other reforms\nmay adversely affect market liquidity, the\npricing of LIBOR-based instruments, and the\navailability and cost of associated hedging\ninstruments and borrowings. The Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) has been\nrecommended by the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (\u201cARRC\u201d) as an alternative to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR. Nevertheless, the transition\naway from LIBOR could result in loss of market\nshare in certain products, adverse tax or\naccounting impacts, compliance, legal or\noperational costs and risks associated with\nclient disclosures, as well as systems\ndisruption, model disruption and other\nbusiness continuity issues for us.\n\nIn addition, risks will remain for us with\nrespect to outstanding instruments which rely\non LIBOR. Those risks arise in connection with\ntransitioning such instruments to a new\nreference rate, the taking of discretionary\nactions (for example, under fallback\nprovisions) or the negotiation of fallback\nprovisions and final amendments to existing\nLIBOR based agreements. Payments under\ncontracts referencing new reference rates may\nsignificantly differ from those referencing\nLIBOR. For some instruments, the method of\ntransitioning to a new reference rate may be\nchallenging, especially if parties to an\ninstrument cannot agree as to how to effect\nthat transition. If a contract is not\ntransitioned to a new reference rate and LIBOR\nceases to exist, the impact on our obligations\nis likely to vary by contract. In addition,\nprior to LIBOR cessation, instruments that\ncontinue to refer to LIBOR may be impacted if\nthere is a change in the availability or\ncalculation of LIBOR. The transition from\nLIBOR to an alternative reference rate has\nchanged our market risk profile and required\nchanges to risk and pricing models, valuation\ntools, product design, information technology\nsystems, reporting infrastructure, operational\nprocesses and controls, and hedging\nstrategies, and may result in or require\nfurther such changes in the future. In many\ncases, we are and may in the future be\ndependent on third parties to upgrade systems,\nsoftware and other critical functions that\ncould materially disrupt our\n                                              \n  37    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nreadiness if they are not done on a timely\nbasis or otherwise fail. Our assessment of the\nultimate impact of, and our planning for, the\ntransition from LIBOR remains ongoing. Failure\nto adequately manage the transition could have\na material adverse effect on our reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations. See \u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d for\nadditional information.\nOur business could be negatively affected if\nwe are unable to attract, retain and motivate\nskilled employees.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our\nability to retain key senior leaders and to\nattract and retain skilled employees,\nparticularly employees with advanced expertise\nin credit, risk, digital and technology\nskills. We depend on our senior leaders and\nskilled employees to oversee simultaneous,\ntransformative initiatives across the\nenterprise and execute on our business plans\nin an efficient and effective manner.\nCompetition for such senior leaders and\nemployees, and the costs associated with\nattracting and retaining them, is high and\nmade even more competitive as a result of the\nexternal environment, including increasing\nrates of job transition and low unemployment.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees also is affected by perceptions of\nour culture and management, our profile in the\nregions where we have offices and the\nprofessional opportunities we offer.\nRegulation or regulatory guidance restricting\nexecutive compensation, as well as evolving\ninvestor expectations, may limit the types of\ncompensation arrangements that we may enter\ninto with our most senior leaders and could\nhave a negative impact on our ability to\nattract, retain and motivate such leaders in\nsupport of our long-term strategy. These laws\nand regulations may not apply in the same\nmanner to all financial institutions and\ntechnology companies, which therefore may\nsubject us to more restrictions than other\ninstitutions and companies with which we\ncompete for talent and may also hinder our\nability to compete for talent with other\nindustries. We rely upon our senior leaders\nnot only for business success, but also to\nlead with integrity. To the extent our senior\nleaders behave in a manner that does not\ncomport with our values, the consequences to\nour brand and reputation could be severe and\ncould adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations. If we are unable to\nattract, develop and retain talented senior\nleadership and employees, or to implement\nappropriate succession plans for our senior\nleadership, our business could be negatively\naffected.\nWe face risks from unpredictable catastrophic\nevents.\nDespite the business contingency plans we have\nin place, such plans do not fully mitigate all\npotential business continuity risks to us.\nNatural disasters and other catastrophic\nevents could harm our employees, business and\ninfrastructure, including our information\ntechnology systems and third-party platforms.\nOur ability to conduct business may be\nadversely affected by a disruption in the\ninfrastructure that supports our business and\nthe communities where we are located, which\nare concentrated in the Northern Virginia and\nNew York metropolitan areas, as well as\nRichmond, Virginia and Plano, Texas. This may\ninclude a disruption involving damage or loss\nof access to a physical site, cyber-attacks\nand other security incidents, terrorist\nactivities, the occurrence or worsening of\ndisease outbreaks or pandemics (including the\nCOVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, extreme\nweather events (including as a result of\nclimate change), electrical outage,\nenvironmental hazards, disruption to\ntechnological infrastructure, communications\nor other services we use, our employees or\nthird parties with whom we conduct business.\nOur business, financial condition and results\nof operations may be impacted by any such\ndisruption and our ability to implement\ncorresponding response measures quickly,\nincluding, for example, our ability to respond\neffectively to a remote work environment as a\nresult of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and\nrelated response measures. In addition, if a\nnatural disaster or other catastrophic event\noccurs in certain regions where our business\nand customers are concentrated, such as the\nmid-Atlantic, New York, California or Texas\nmetropolitan areas, we could be\ndisproportionately impacted as compared to our\ncompetitors. The impact of such events and\nother catastrophes on the overall economy may\nalso adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations.\n\nClimate change manifesting as physical or\ntransition risks could adversely affect our\noperations, businesses and customers.\n\nThe physical risks of climate change include\ndiscrete events, such as flooding and\nwildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate\npatterns, such as extreme heat, sea level\nrise, and more frequent and prolonged drought.\nSuch events could disrupt our operations or\nthose of our customers or third parties on\nwhich we rely, including through direct damage\nto assets and indirect impacts from supply\nchain disruption and market volatility.\nAdditionally, transitioning to a low-carbon\neconomy may entail significant policy, legal,\ntechnology and market initiatives. Transition\nrisks, including changes in consumer\npreferences and additional regulatory\nrequirements or taxes, could increase our\nexpenses and impact our strategies or those of\nour customers. Physical and transition risks\ncould also affect the financial health of\ncertain customers in impacted industries or\ngeographies. In addition, our reputation and\nclient relationships may be damaged as a\nresult of our practices and decisions related\nto climate change and the environment, or the\npractices or involvement of our clients, in\ncertain industries or projects associated with\ncausing or exacerbating climate change.\nClimate risk is interconnected with many risk\ntypes. We continue to enhance processes to\nembed evolving climate risk considerations\ninto our risk management strategies\nestablished for risks such as market, credit\n                                              \n  38    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nand operational risks; however, because the\ntiming and severity of climate change may not\nbe predictable, our risk management strategies\nmay not be effective in mitigating climate\nrisk exposure.\n\nWe face risks from the use of or changes to\nassumptions or estimates in our financial\nstatements.\n\nPursuant to generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we are\nrequired to use certain assumptions and\nestimates in preparing our financial\nstatements, including determining our\nallowance for credit losses, the fair value of\ncertain assets and liabilities, and goodwill\nimpairment, among other items. In addition,\nthe FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies\nmay change the financial accounting and\nreporting standards, including those related\nto assumptions and estimates we use to prepare\nour financial statements, in ways that we\ncannot predict and that could impact our\nfinancial statements. If actual results differ\nfrom the assumptions or estimates underlying\nour financial statements or if financial\naccounting and reporting standards are\nchanged, we may experience unexpected material\nlosses. For a discussion of our use of\nestimates in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements, see\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Critical Accounting Policies and\nEstimates\u201d and \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies.\u201d\nThe soundness of other financial institutions\nand other third parties could adversely affect\nus.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and\nother transactions could be adversely affected\nby the stability and actions of other\nfinancial services institutions. Financial\nservices institutions are interrelated as a\nresult of trading, clearing, servicing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. We have\nexposure to financial institutions,\nintermediaries and counterparties that are\nexposed to risks over which we have little or\nno control.\n\nIn addition, we routinely execute transactions\nwith counterparties in the financial services\nindustry, including brokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds and other institutional clients,\nresulting in a significant credit\nconcentration with respect to the financial\nservices industry overall. As a result,\ndefaults by, or even rumors or questions\nabout, one or more financial services\ninstitutions, or the financial services\nindustry generally, have led to market-wide\nliquidity problems and could lead to losses or\ndefaults by us or by other institutions.\n\nLikewise, adverse developments affecting the\noverall strength and soundness of our\ncompetitors, the financial services industry\nas a whole and the general economic climate or\nsovereign debt could have a negative impact on\nperceptions about the strength and soundness\nof our business even if we are not subject to\nthe same adverse developments.

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\ncalculation of our residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments, are included in the\nOther category.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenue and expenses directly or\nindirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation process is\nunique to each business segment and acquired\nbusiness.

These drivers were\npartially offset by lower legal reserve builds\nin non-interest expense and an increase in\nincome tax benefit due to a higher pre-tax\nloss and the impact of the tax credits.\n                                              \n  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  \n                                              \nThe preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make a number of judgments, estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amount of assets,\nliabilities, income and expenses on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nUnderstanding our accounting policies and the\nextent to which we use management judgment and\nestimates in applying these policies is\nintegral to understanding our financial\nstatements. We provide a summary of our\nsignificant accounting policies under \u201cNote\n1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d.\n\nWe have identified the following accounting\nestimates as critical because they require\nsignificant judgments and assumptions about\nhighly complex and inherently uncertain\nmatters and the use of reasonably different\nestimates and assumptions could have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations\nor financial condition. Our critical\naccounting policies and estimates are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Loan loss reserves\n\n\u2022 Goodwill\n\n\u2022 Fair value\n\n\u2022 Customer rewards reserve\nWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates\nand judgments on an ongoing basis and update\nthem as necessary, based on changing\nconditions.\n                                              \n  67    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Loan Loss Reserves                          \n                                              \nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\nthat represents management\u2019s current estimate\nof expected credit losses inherent in our\ncredit card, consumer banking and commercial\nbanking loans held for investment portfolios\nas of each balance sheet date. We also\nseparately reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments that are not unconditionally\ncancellable. For all such loans and unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimate of expected\ncredit losses includes a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period of one year and\nthen reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses at each relevant loss\ncomponent of the estimate. We build our\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses, which is driven\nby charge-offs, changes in the allowance for\ncredit losses and changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments. The allowance\nfor credit losses was $11.4 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021, compared to $15.6 billion\nas of December 31, 2020. In periods prior to\n2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses\nrepresented management\u2019s estimate of incurred\nloan and lease losses as fully described in\n\u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nWe have an established process, using\nanalytical tools and management judgment, to\ndetermine our allowance for credit losses.\nSignificant management judgement is required\nto determine the relevant information and\nestimation methods used to arrive at our best\nestimate of lifetime losses. Establishing the\nallowance on a quarterly basis involves\nevaluating both credit and macroeconomic\nvariables. The macroeconomic forecast used to\ninform both quantitative and qualitative\ncomponents of our allowance for credit losses\nestimate is sensitive to variables that impact\nborrowers\u2019 ability to pay, such as the U.S.\nUnemployment Rate, and the U.S. Real Gross\nDomestic Product (\u201cGDP\u201d) Rate assumptions.\n\nIn addition to macroeconomic factors, many\ncredit factors inform our allowance for credit\nlosses, including, but not limited to,\nhistorical loss and recovery experience,\nrecent trends in delinquencies and charge-\noffs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy\nfilings, the value of collateral underlying\nsecured loans, account seasoning, changes in\nour credit evaluation, underwriting and\ncollection management policies, seasonality,\ncredit bureau scores, current general economic\nconditions, changes in the legal and\nregulatory environment and uncertainties in\nforecasting and modeling techniques used in\nestimating our allowance for credit losses.\n\nWe have a governance framework intended to\nensure that our estimate of the allowance for\ncredit losses is appropriate. Our governance\nframework provides for oversight of methods,\nmodels, qualitative adjustments, process\ncontrols and results. At least quarterly,\nrepresentatives from the Finance and Risk\nManagement organizations review and assess our\nallowance methodologies, key assumptions and\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nGroups independent of our estimation functions\nparticipate in the review and validation\nprocess. Tasks performed by these groups\ninclude periodic review of the rationale for\nand quantification of inputs requiring\njudgment as well as adjustments to results.\n\nWe have a model policy, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which governs\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for estimating\ncredit losses. The Model Risk Office validates\nall models and requires ongoing monitoring of\ntheir performance.\n\nIn addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses, on a quarterly basis, we review and\nassess our estimate of expected losses related\nto unfunded lending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. The factors\nimpacting our assessment generally align with\nthose considered in our evaluation of the\nallowance for credit losses for the Commercial\nBanking business. The reserve for losses on\nunfunded lending commitments is included in\nother liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets and changes to it are recorded through\nthe provision for credit losses in the\nconsolidated statements of income.\n\nAlthough we examine a variety of externally\navailable data, as well as our internal loan\nperformance data, to determine our allowance\nfor credit losses and reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimation process is\nsubject to risks and uncertainties, including\na reliance on historical loss and trend\ninformation that may not be representative of\ncurrent conditions and indicative of future\nperformance as well as economic forecasts that\nmay not align with actual future economic\nconditions. Accordingly, our actual credit\nloss experience may not be in line with our\nexpectations. We provide additional\ninformation on the methodologies and key\nassumptions used in determining our allowance\nfor credit losses for each of our loan\nportfolio segments in \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies.\u201d We provide\ninformation on the components of our\nallowance, disaggregated by operating segment,\nand changes in our allowance in \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments.\u201d\n                                              \n  68    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe reserve for the uncollectible portion of\nfinance charges and fees related to credit\ncard loan receivables in the allowance for\ncredit losses. Our methodology for estimating\nthe uncollectible portion of finance charges\nand fees is consistent with the methodology we\nuse to estimate the allowance for credit\nlosses on the principal portion of our credit\ncard loan receivables.\n                                              \n  Goodwill                                    \n                                              \nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred, plus\nthe fair value of any non-controlling\ninterests in the acquiree, over the fair value\nof the net assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed as of the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill totaled $14.8 billion and $14.7\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. We did not recognize any\ngoodwill impairment in 2021 and 2020. See\n\u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d\nfor additional information.\n\nWe perform our goodwill impairment test\nannually on October 1 at a reporting unit\nlevel. We are also required to test goodwill\nfor impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-\nnot that an impairment may have occurred. An\nimpairment of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is\ndetermined based on the amount by which the\nreporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its\nfair value, limited to the amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit. We have four\nreporting units: Credit Card, Auto Finance,\nOther Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.\n\nFor the purpose of our goodwill impairment\ntesting, we calculate the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit using an allocated capital\napproach based on each reporting unit\u2019s\nspecific regulatory capital requirements,\neconomic capital requirements and underlying\nrisks. The carrying amount for a reporting\nunit is the sum of its respective capital\nrequirements, goodwill and other intangibles\nbalances. Consolidated stockholder\u2019s equity in\nexcess of the sum of all reporting unit\u2019s\ncapital requirements that is not identified\nfor future capital needs, such as dividends,\nshare buybacks or other strategic initiatives,\nis allocated to the reporting units and the\nOther category and assumed distributed to\nequity holders in future periods.\n\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit\nis a subjective process that requires the use\nof estimates and the exercise of significant\njudgment. We calculate the fair value of our\nreporting units using a discounted cash flow\n(\u201cDCF\u201d) calculation, a form of the income\napproach. This DCF calculation uses projected\ncash flows based on each reporting unit\u2019s\ninternal forecast and the perpetuity growth\nmethod to calculate terminal values. Our DCF\ncalculation requires management to make\nestimates about future loan, deposit and\nrevenue growth, as well as credit losses and\ncapital rates. These cash flows and terminal\nvalues are then discounted using discount\nrates based on our external cost of capital\nwith adjustments for the risk inherent in each\nreporting unit. Discount rates used for our\nreporting units ranged from 8.4% to 12.1%, and\nwe applied a terminal year long-term growth\nrate of 4.0% to all reporting units. The\nreasonableness of our DCF calculation is a\nssessed by reference to a market-based\napproach using comparable market multiples and\nrecent market transactions where available.\nThe results of the 2021 annual impairment test\nfor the reporting units indicated that the\nestimated fair values of the Commercial\nBanking, Credit Card, Auto Finance, and Other\nConsumer Banking reporting units exceeded\ntheir carrying amounts by between 44% and\n131%.\n\nAssumptions used in estimating the fair value\nof a reporting unit are judgmental and\ninherently uncertain. A change in the economic\nconditions of a reporting unit, such as\ndeclines in business performance from industry\nor macroeconomic trends or from changes in our\nstrategy, adverse impacts to loan or deposit\ngrowth trends, decreases in revenue, increases\nin expenses, increases in credit losses,\nincreases in capital requirements,\ndeterioration of market conditions, declines\nin long-term growth expectations, adverse\nimpacts of regulatory or legislative changes\nor increases in the estimated cost of capital,\nincluding if these conditions are merely\nforecasted to occur in future periods, could\ncause the estimated fair values of our\nreporting units to decline in the future, and\nincrease the risk of a goodwill impairment in\na future period.\n                                              \n  Fair Value                                  \n                                              \nFair value, also referred to as an exit price,\nis defined as the price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n\nLevel 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices\n(unadjusted) in active markets for identical\nassets or liabilities.\n                                              \n  69    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nLevel 2: Valuation is based on observable\nmarket-based inputs other than Level 1 prices,\nsuch as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active, or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially the\nfull term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3: Valuation is generated from\ntechniques that use significant assumptions\nnot observable in the market. Valuation\ntechniques include pricing models, discounted\ncash flow methodologies or similar techniques.\n\nThe degree of management judgment involved in\ndetermining the fair value of a financial\ninstrument is dependent upon the availability\nof quoted prices in active markets or\nobservable market parameters. When quoted\nprices and observable data in active markets\nare not fully available, management judgment\nis necessary to estimate fair value. Changes\nin market conditions, such as reduced\nliquidity in the capital markets or changes in\nsecondary market activities, may reduce the\navailability and reliability of quoted prices\nor observable data used to determine fair\nvalue.\n\nWe have developed policies and procedures to\ndetermine when markets for our financial\nassets and liabilities are inactive if the\nlevel and volume of activity has declined\nsignificantly relative to normal conditions.\nIf markets are determined to be inactive, it\nmay be appropriate to adjust price quotes\nreceived. When significant adjustments are\nrequired to price quotes or inputs, it may be\nappropriate to utilize an estimate based\nprimarily on unobservable inputs.\n\nSignificant judgment may be required to\ndetermine whether certain financial\ninstruments measured at fair value are\nclassified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making\nthis determination, we consider all available\ninformation that market participants use to\nmeasure the fair value of the financial\ninstrument, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused. Based upon the specific facts and\ncircumstances of each instrument or instrument\ncategory, judgments are made regarding the\nsignificance of the Level 3 inputs to the\ninstruments\u2019 fair value measurement in its\nentirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. We\ndiscuss changes in the valuation inputs and\nassumptions used in determining the fair value\nof our financial instruments, including the\nextent to which we have relied on significant\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value and\nour process for corroborating these inputs, in\n\u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value Measurement.\u201d\n\nWe have a governance framework and a number of\nkey controls that are intended to ensure that\nour fair value measurements are appropriate\nand reliable. Our governance framework\nprovides for independent oversight and\nsegregation of duties. Our control processes\ninclude review and approval of new transaction\ntypes, price verification, and review of\nvaluation judgments, methods, models, process\ncontrols and results.\n\nGroups independent of our trading and\ninvesting functions participate in the review\nand validation process. Tasks performed by\nthese groups include periodic verification of\nfair value measurements to determine if\nassigned fair values are reasonable, including\ncomparing prices from vendor pricing services\nto other available market information.\n\nOur Fair Value Committee (\u201cFVC\u201d), which\nincludes representation from business areas,\nRisk Management and Finance, provides guidance\nand oversight to ensure an appropriate\nvaluation control environment. The FVC\nregularly reviews and approves our fair\nvaluations to ensure that our valuation\npractices are consistent with industry\nstandards and adhere to regulatory and\naccounting guidance.\n\nWe have a model policy, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which governs\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for pricing and fair\nvalue measurements. The Model Risk Office\nvalidates all models and requires ongoing\nmonitoring of their performance.\n\nThe fair value governance process is set up in\na manner that allows the Chairperson of the\nFVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot\nbe resolved by the FVC to a more senior\ncommittee called the Valuations Advisory\nCommittee (\u201cVAC\u201d) for resolution. The VAC is\nchaired by the Chief Financial Officer and\nincludes other members of senior manageme nt.\nThe VAC convenes to review escalated valuation\ndisputes. There were no disputes for the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                              \n  Customer Rewards Reserve                    \n                                              \nWe offer products, primarily credit cards,\nwhich include programs that allow members to\nearn rewards based on account activity that\ncan be redeemed for cash (primarily in the\nform of statement credits), gift cards,\ntravel, or covering eligible charges. The\namount of rewards that a customer earns varies\nbased on the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program and product. The majority of\nour rewards do not expire and there is no\nlimit on the amount of rewards an eligible\ncard member can\n                                              \n  70    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nearn. Customer rewards costs, which we\ngenerally record as an offset to interchange\nincome, are driven by various factors such as\ncard member purchase volume, the terms and\nconditions of the rewards program and rewards\nredemption cost. We establish a customer\nrewards reserve that reflects management\u2019s\njudgment regarding rewards earned that are\nexpected to be redeemed and the estimated\nredemption cost.\n\nWe use financial models to estimate ultimate\nredemption rates of rewards earned to date by\ncurrent card members based on historical\nredemption trends, current enrollee redemption\nbehavior, card product type, year of program\nenrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend\nlevels. Our current assumption is that the\nvast majority of all rewards earned will\neventually be redeemed. We use the weighted-\naverage redemption cost during the previous\ntwelve months, adjusted as appropriate for\nrecent changes in redemption costs, including\nchanges related to the mix of rewards\nredeemed, to estimate future redemption costs.\nWe continually evaluate our reserve and\nassumptions based on developments in\nredemption patterns, changes to the terms and\nconditions of the rewards program and other\nfactors. While the rewards liability is\nsensitive to changes in assumptions for\nredemption rates and costs and involves\nmanagement judgment, we believe portfolio\ncharacteristics and historical performance are\nthe best indication of future reward\nredemption behavior and are the primary basis\nfor our estimate. We recognized customer\nrewards expense of $6.4 billion in 2021 and\n$4.9 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Our\ncustomer rewards reserve, which is included in\nother liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets, totaled $6.2 billion and $5.4 billion\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n                                       \n  ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS  \n                                       \nAccounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as\nof December 31, 2021\nThere were no relevant new accounting\nstandards issued but not adopted as of\nDecember 31, 2021 See \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d for\ninformation on the accounting standards we\nadopted in 2021.\n                                              \n  71    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                      \n  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  \n                      \nThe level and composition of our capital are\ndetermined by multiple factors, including our\nconsolidated regulatory capital requirements\nas described in more detail below and internal\nrisk-based capital assessments such as\ninternal stress testing and economic capital.\nThe level and composition of our capital may\nalso be influenced by rating agency\nguidelines, subsidiary capital requirements,\nbusiness environment, conditions in the\nfinancial markets and assessments of potential\nfuture losses due to adverse changes in our\nbusiness and market environments.\n                                              \n  Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective     \n  Action                                      \n                                              \nThe Company and the Banks are subject to the\nregulatory capital requirements established by\nthe Federal Reserve and the OCC respectively\n(the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d). The Basel III\nCapital Rules implement certain capital\nrequirements published by the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d),\nalong with certain provisions of the Dodd-\nFrank Act and other capital provisions.\n\nFollowing amendments to the Basel III Capital\nRules in October 2019 to provide for tailored\napplication of certain capital requirements\nacross different categories of banking\ninstitutions (the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d), the\nCompany, as a BHC with total consolidated\nassets of at least $250 billion but less than\n$700 billion and not exceeding any of the\napplicable risk-based thresholds, is a\nCategory III institution.\n\nThe Banks, as subsidiaries of a Category III\ninstitution, are Category III banks. Moreover,\nthe Banks, as insured depository institutions,\nare subject to PCA capital regulations.\n                                              \n  Basel III and United States Capital Rules   \n                                              \nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%,\na Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total\ncapital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in\nrelation to risk-weighted assets. In addition,\nwe must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of\n4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage\nratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the\ncapital conservation buffer and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirements,\nas described below.\n\nAs a Category III institution, effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches framework\nand certain associated capital requirements,\nand we have elected to exclude certain\nelements of AOCI from our regulatory capital\nas permitted for a Category III institution.\nWe remain subject to the countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirement (which is currently\nset at 0%) and supplementary leverage ratio\nrequirement of 3.0%.\n\nG-SIBs that are based in the U.S. are subject\nto an additional CET1 capital requirement\nknown as the \u201cG-SIB Surcharge.\u201d We are not a\nG-SIB based on the most recent available data\nand thus we are not subject to a G-SIB\nSurcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. In March\n2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule\nto implement the stress capital buffer\nrequirement (the \u201cStress Capital Buffer\nRule\u201d). The stress capital buffer requirement\nis institution-specific and replaces the fixed\n2.5% capital conservation buffer previously in\nplace for BHCs.\n\nPursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule,\nthe Federal Reserve uses the results of its\nsupervisory stress test to determine the size\nof a BHC\u2019s stress capital buffer requirement.\nIn particular, a BHC\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement equals, subject to a floor of\n2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between\nthe BHC\u2019s starting CET1 capital ratio and its\nlowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the\nseverely adverse scenario of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s supervisory stress test plus (ii)\nthe ratio of the BHC\u2019s projected four quarters\nof common stock dividends (for the fourth to\nseventh quarters of the planning horizon) to\nthe projected risk-weighted assets for the\nquarter in which the BHC\u2019s projected CET1\ncapital ratio reaches its minimum under the\nsupervisory stress test.\n\nUnder the Stress Capital Buffer Rule\nframework, the Company\u2019s \u201cstandardized\napproach capital conservation buffer\u201d includes\nits stress capital buffer requirement (which\nwill be recalibrated every year based on the\nCompany\u2019s supervisory stress test results),\nany G-SIB Surcharge (which is not applicable\nto us) and the countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement (which is currently set at 0%).\nAny determination to increase the\ncountercyclical capital buffer generally would\nbe effective twelve months after the\nannouncement of such an increase, unless the\nFederal Banking Agencies, set an earlier\neffective date.\n                                              \n  72    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2020 supervisory stress\ntesting results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement was 5.6% for the period\nfrom October 1, 2020 through September 30,\n2021. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework were\n10.1%, 11.6% and 13.6%, respectively, for the\nperiod from October 1, 2020 through September\n30, 2021.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2021 supervisory stress\ntesting results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is\n2.5%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 7.0%,\n8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2021 through September 30,\n2022.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Banks. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, each Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%\nrespectively.\n\nIf the Company or any of the Banks fails to\nmaintain its capital ratios above the minimum\ncapital requirements plus the applicable\ncapital conservation buffer requirements, it\nwill face increasingly strict automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments to certain\nexecutive officers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, each of the Company and the\nBanks exceeded the minimum capital\nrequirements and the capital conservation\nbuffer requirements applicable to them, and\neach of the Company and the Banks was \u201cwell-\ncapitalized.\u201d The \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards\napplicable to the Company are established in\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations, and the\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards applicable to the\nBanks are established in the OCC\u2019s PCA capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading book. The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more. As of December 31, 2021, the Company\nand CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule .\nSee \u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d below for\nadditional information.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (the \u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that\nprovides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the current expected credit loss\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) standard on their regulatory capital\n(the \u201cCECL Transition Election\u201d). We adopted\nthe CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as\nof January 1, 2020, and made the CECL\nTransition Election (for regulatory capital\npurposes) in the first quarter of 2020.\nTherefore, the applicable amounts presented in\nthis Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

The Company\u2019s CET1 capital\nratio, reflecting the CECL Transition Rule,\nwas 13.1% as of December 31, 2021, and would\nhave been 12.4% excluding the impact of the\nCECL Transition Rule (or \"on a fully phased-in\nbasis\").\n\nExpiration of the Temporary Exclusions for\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio\n\nIn April 2020, as part of the response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve issued\nan interim final rule that temporarily\nexcluded U.S. Treasury securities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation\nof the supplementary leverage ratio for BHCs.\nThese temporary exclusions remained in effect\nthrough March 31, 2021 and expired as\nscheduled thereafter. The Company\u2019s\nsupplementary leverage ratio as of December\n31, 2020, as presented in Table 12 of this\nReport, reflected these temporary exclusions.\n\nIn May 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies\nissued an interim final rule that provided an\noption for depository institutions to make\nsimilar exclusions to the calculation of the\nsupplementary leverage ratio. An electing\ndepository institution would have been\nrequired to request prior approval from its\nprimary federal banking regulator before\nmaking any capital distributions for as long\nas the exclusions were in effect.

Based on the results, all\nparticipating BHCs, including the Company,\nremained above their risk-based minimum\ncapital requirements in the hypothetical\nstress scenario. Accordingly, as laid out\npreviously by the Federal Reserve, the\ntemporary capital distribution restrictions as\ndescribed above ended for all participating\nBHCs, including the Company, after the second\nquarter of 2021.

It also\nsets expectations for our \u201cThree Lines of\nDefense\u201d model, which defines the roles,\nresponsibilities and accountabilities for\ntaking and managing risk across the Company.\nAccountability for overseeing an effective\nFramework resides with our Board of Directors\neither directly or through its committees.\n\nThe \u201cFirst Line of Defense\u201d consists of any\nline of business or function that is\naccountable for risk taking and is responsible\nfor: (i) engaging in activities designed to\ngenerate revenue or reduce expenses; (ii)\nproviding operational support or servicing to\nany business function for the delivery of\nproducts or services to customers; or (iii)\nproviding technology services in direct\nsupport of first line business areas. Each\nline of business or first line function must\nmanage the risks associated with their\nactivities, including identifying, assessing,\nmeasuring, monitoring, controlling, and\nreporting the risks within its business\nactivities, consistent with the risk\nframework. The \u201cSecond Line of Defense\u201d\nconsists of two types of functions:\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d) and\nSupport Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking\nactivities and assesses risks and issues\nindependent from the first line of defense.\nSupport Functions are centers of specialized\nexpertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting,\nLegal) that provide support services to the\nCompany. The \u201cThird Line of Defense\u201d is\ncomprised of the Internal Audit and Credit\nReview functions. The third line provides\nindependent and objective assurance to senior\nmanagement and to the Board of Directors that\nthe first and second lines of defense have\nsystems and governance processes which are\nwell-designed and working as intended, and\nthat the Framework is appropriate for our\nsize, complexity and risk profile.\n\nOur Framework consists of the following nine\nelements:\n                                              \n  Govern\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Accoun\u2026                                     \n  Strate\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Risk                                        \n  Alignm\u2026                                     \n             Assessm\u2026    Monitor\u2026    Aggreg\u2026  \n  Risk       Measure\u2026    and         Report\u2026  \n  Identi\u2026    and         Testing     and      \n             Response                Escala\u2026  \n  Capital                                     \n  and                                         \n  Liquid\u2026                                     \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Stress                                      \n  Testin\u2026                                     \n  Risk                                        \n  Data                                        \n  and                                         \n  Enabli\u2026                                     \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Culture                                     \n  and                                         \n  Talent                                      \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  79    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Governance and Accountability               \n                                              \nThis element of the Framework sets the\nfoundation for the methods for governing risk\ntaking and the interactions within and among\nour three lines of defense.\n\nWe established a risk governance structure and\naccountabilities to effectively and\nconsistently oversee the management of risks\nacross the Company.

The strategic planning\nprocess should consider relevant changes to\nthe Company\u2019s overall risk profile.\n\nOur Board of Directors approves a Risk\nAppetite Statement for the Company to set\nforth the high-level principles that govern\nrisk taking at the Company. The Risk Appetite\nStatement defines the Board of Directors\u2019\ntolerance for certain risk outcomes at an\nenterprise level and enables senior management\nto manage and report within these boundaries.\nThis Risk Appetite Statement is also supported\nby risk category specific risk appetite\nstatements as well as metrics and, where\nappropriate, Board Limits and Board\nNotification Thresholds.\n                                              \n  Risk Identification                         \n                                              \nThe first line of defense and certain Support\nFunctions shall identify new and emerging\nrisks across the relevant risk categories\nassociated with their business activities and\nobjectives, in consultation with IRM.

As part of the risk assessment\nprocess, the first and second lines of defense\nalso evaluate the effectiveness of the\nexisting control environment and mitigation\nstrategies.\n\nManagement shall determine the appropriate\nrisk response. Risks may be mitigated,\naccepted, transferred, or avoided. Actions\ntaken to respond to the risk include\nimplementing new controls, enhancing existing\ncontrols, developing additional mitigation\nstrategies to reduce the impact of the risk,\nand/or monitoring the risk.\n                                              \n  Monitoring and Testing                      \n                                              \nManagement periodically monitors risks to\nevaluate and measure how the risk is affecting\nour strategy and business objectives, in\nalignment with risk appetite, including\nestablished concentration risk limits.

In commercial\nunderwriting, we generally require strong cash\nflow, collateral, covenants, and guarantees.\nIn addition to sound underwriting, we closely\nmonitor our portfolio and take steps to\ncollect or work out distressed loans.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with\nthe Consumer and Commercial Chief Credit\nOfficers, is responsible for establishing\ncredit risk policies and procedures, including\nunderwriting and hold guidelines and credit\napproval authority, and monitoring credit\nexposure and performance of our lending\nrelated transactions. Our Consumer and\nCommercial Chief Credit Officers are\nresponsible for evaluating the risk\nimplications of credit strategy and the\noversight of credit for both the existing\nportfolio and any new credit investments. They\nalso have formal approval authority for\nvarious types and levels of credit decisions,\nincluding individual commercial loan\ntransactions. Division Presidents within each\nsegment are responsible for managing the\ncredit risk within their divisions and\nmaintaining processes to control credit risk\nand comply with credit policies and\nguidelines. In addition, the Chief Risk\nOfficer establishes policies, delegates\napproval authority and monitors performance\nfor non-loan credit exposure entered into with\nfinancial counterparties or through the\npurchase of credit sensitive securities in our\ninvestment portfolio.\n\nOur credit policies establish standards in\nfive areas: customer selection, underwriting,\nmonitoring, remediation and portfolio\nmanagement. The standards in each area provide\na framework comprising specific objectives and\ncontrol processes. These standards are\nsupported by detailed policies and procedures\nfor each component of the credit process.\nStarting with customer selection, our goal is\nto generally provide credit on terms that\ngenerate above hurdle returns. We use a number\nof quantitative and qualitative factors to\nmanage credit risk, including setting credit\nrisk limits and guidelines for each of our\nlines of business. We monitor performance\nrelative to these guidelines and report\nresults and any required mitigating actions to\nappropriate senior management committees and\nour Board of Directors.\n                                              \n   Liquidity Risk Management                  \n                                              \nWe manage liquidity risk by applying our\nLiquidity Framework.

We continuously monitor\nmarket and economic conditions to evaluate\nemerging stress conditions and to develop\nappropriate action plans in accordance with\nour Contingency Funding Plan and our Recovery\nPlans, which include the Company\u2019s policies,\nprocedures and action plans for managing\nliquidity stress events. The Liquidity\nFramework enables us to manage our liquidity\nrisk in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements.\n\nAdditionally, the Liquidity Framework\nestablishes governing principles that apply to\nthe management of liquidity risk. We use these\nprinciples to monitor, measure and report\nliquidity risk; to develop funding and\ninvestment strategies that enable us to\nmaintain an adequate level of liquidity to\nsupport our businesses and satisfy regulatory\nrequirements; and to protect us from a broad\nrange of liquidity events should they arise.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer, in conjunction with\nthe Chief Market and Liquidity Risk Officer,\nis responsible for the establishment of\nliquidity risk management policies and\nstandards for governance and monitoring of\nliquidity risk at a corporate level. We assess\nliquidity strength by evaluating several\ndifferent balance sheet metrics under severe\nstress scenarios to ensure we can withstand\nsignificant funding degradation through\nsystemic, idiosyncratic, and combined\nliquidity stress scenarios. Management reports\nliquidity metrics to appropriate senior\nmanagement committees no less than quarterly\nand to our Board of Directors no less than\nsemi-annually.\n\nWe seek to mitigate liquidity risk\nstrategically and tactically. From a strategic\nperspective, we have acquired and built\ndeposit gathering businesses and actively\nmonitor our funding concentration.

The underwriting\ncriteria, which are customized for individual\nproducts and marketing programs, are\nestablished based on an analysis of the net\npresent value of expected revenues, expenses\nand losses, subject to further analysis using\na variety of stress conditions. Underwriting\ndecisions are generally based on credit bureau\ninformation, including payment history, debt\nburden and credit scores, such as FICO scores,\nand on other factors, such as applicant\nincome. We maintain a credit card\nsecuritization program and selectively sell\ncharged-off credit card loans.\n\n\u2022 Auto: We originate both prime and subprime\nauto loans through a network of auto dealers\nand direct marketing. Our auto loans generally\nhave fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75\nmonths or less, but can go up to 84 months.\nLoan size limits are customized by program and\nare generally less than $75,000. Similar to\ncredit card accounts, the underwriting\ncriteria are customized for individual\nproducts and marketing programs and based on\nanalysis of net present value of expected\nrevenues, expenses and losses, and are subject\nto maintaining resilience under a variety of\nstress conditions. Underwriting decisions are\ngenerally based on an applicant\u2019s income,\nestimated net disposable income, and credit\nbureau information including FICO scores,\nalong with collateral characteristics such as\nloan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratio. We maintain an\nauto securitization program.\n\n\u2022 Commercial: We offer a range of commercial\nlending products, including loans secured by\ncommercial real estate and loans to middle\nmarket commercial and industrial companies.\nOur commercial loans may have a fixed or\nvariable interest rate; however, the majority\nof our commercial loans have variable rates.\nOur underwriting standards require an analysis\nof the borrower\u2019s financial condition and\nprospects, as well as an assessment of the\nindustry in which the borrower operates. Where\nrelevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying\ncollateral and guarantees. We maintain\nunderwriting guidelines and limits for major\ntypes of borrowers and loan products that\nspecify, where applicable, guidelines for debt\nservice coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and\nstandard covenants and conditions. We assign a\nrisk rating and establish a monitoring\nschedule for loans based on the risk profile\nof the borrower, industry segment, source of\nrepayment, the underlying collateral and\nguarantees, if any, and current market\nconditions. Although we generally retain the\ncommercial loans we underwrite, we may\nsyndicate positions for risk mitigation\npurposes, including bridge financing\ntransactions we have underwritten. In\naddition, we originate and service multifamily\ncommercial real estate loans which are sold to\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises.\n                                              \n  85    Capital

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n                                              \n  Table 21: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            December         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     31, 2021         31, 2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             71  %            69  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or              29               31     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             50  %            46  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660           20               20     \n  620 or              30               34     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

Our\n30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans\nheld for investment that are 30 or more days\npast due, whereas our 30+ day performing\ndelinquency metrics include all loans held for\ninvestment that are 30 or more days past due\nbut are currently classified as performing and\naccruing interest.

In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\namortized cost.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, with a portion of these loans\nreceiving an interest rate reduction or a\ngross balance reduction. The impairment on\nmodified commercial loans is generally\ndetermined based on the underlying collateral\nvalue.\n                                              \n  95    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe provide additional information on modified\nloans accounted for as TDRs, including the\nperformance of those loans subsequent to\nmodification, in \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans.\u201d\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date.

The NSFR Rule\nrequires the Company and each of the Banks to\nmaintain an amount of available stable\nfunding, which is a weighted measure of a\ncompany\u2019s funding sources over a one-year time\nhorizon, calculated by applying standardized\nweightings to equity and liabilities based on\ntheir expected stability, that is no less than\na specified percentage of its required stable\nfunding, which is calculated by applying\nstandardized weightings to assets, derivatives\nexposures and certain other items based on\ntheir liquidity characteristics. As a Category\nIII institution, the Company and the Banks are\neach required to maintain available stable\nfunding in an amount at least equal to 85% of\nits required stable funding. The NSFR Rule\nbecame effective on July 1, 2021 and applies\nto the Company and each of the Banks. The NSFR\nRule includes a semi-annual public disclosure\nrequirement, with the first disclosure due 45\ndays after the end of the second quarter of\n2023.

We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or re-pricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments which could\ninclude caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact on our projected 12-month\nbaseline net interest income resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. In addition to\nour existing assets and liabilities, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions, such as loan and deposit growth\nand pricing, and plans for projected changes\nin our funding mix in our baseline forecast.\nIn measuring the sensitivity of interest rate\nmovements on our projected net interest\nincome, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous\nparallel shift in the level of interest rates\ndetailed in Table 35 below . At the current\nlevel of interest rates, our net interest\nincome is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease in lower rate\nscenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward\nshocks has decreased as compared to December\n31, 2020, mainly due to the increase in market\ninterest rates and a decrease in our cash\nbalances.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity                    \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact on the net\npresent value of our assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivative exposures, resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Key\nassumptions used in the calculation include\nprojecting rate sensitive prepayments for\nmortgage securities, loans and other assets,\nterm structure modeling of interest rates,\ndiscount spreads, and deposit volume and\npricing assumptions. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\neconomic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n35 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity increases moderately\nin higher interest rate scenarios (+50 and\n+100bps), while decreasing in a more extreme\nhigher interest rate scenario (+200 bps) and a\nlower interest rate scenario (-50 bps). Our\ncurrent economic value of equity sensitivity\nto upward shocks has also decreased as\ncompared to December 31, 2020 mainly due to\nthe increase in long-term interest rates and a\ndecrease in our cash balances.\n\nTable 35 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand economic value of equity calculated under\nthe methodology described above as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020.

Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on the existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities.\u201d\n                                              \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                       \n                                              \nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to\nchanges in the values of current holdings and\nfuture cash flows denominated in other\ncurrencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nintercompany funding outstanding was 520\nmillion GBP and 320 million GBP as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 5.0\nbillion CAD and 5.3 billion CAD as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our EUR-\ndenominated borrowings outstanding were 1.2\nbillion EUR and 1.3 billion EUR as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n                                              \n  104    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet to\ntranslation risk in AOCI and our capital\nratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 1.8 billion\nGBP and 1.7 billion GBP as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, and 1.9 billion\nCAD and 1.5 billion CAD as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal. For further information on our\nrisk related to customer accommodation\nderivatives, see \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\nTransition\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority (\u201cFCA\u201d), the regulator for the\nadministration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR\nwould be transitioned as an interest rate\nbenchmark and that it will no longer compel\npanel banks to contribute LIBOR data beyond\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark\nAdministration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of\nLIBOR, confirmed its intention to cease\npublication of the 1-week and 2-month USD\nLIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR\npublication on December 31, 2021, and the\nremaining USD LIBOR tenors (overnight; 1, 3,\n6, and 12 months) immediately following the\nLIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. The\ncontinuation of USD LIBOR as a representative\nrate into mid-2023 will allow many legacy USD\nLIBOR contracts to mature prior to cessation.\nFollowing IBA\u2019s announcement, the FCA formally\nannounced the future permanent cessation and\nloss of representativeness of LIBOR\nbenchmarks. The Federal Banking Agencies\nissued further guidance that banking\norganizations should cease using USD LIBOR as\na reference rate in new contracts as soon as\npracticable and in any event by December 31,\n2021.\n\nOur enterprise LIBOR transition program team,\nwhich has been working on this effort since\n2018 and includes senior management\nrepresentatives from across the enterprise,\nprovides monthly reporting to senior\nmanagement and quarterly reporting to our\nBoard of Directors. The information provided\nto senior management and the Board of\nDirectors includes exposure reporting, updates\non progress toward our goals to reduce our\nLIBOR exposure and relevant regulatory or\nindustry developments.\n\nOur transition effort is focused on two\nobjectives: 1) remediation of our existing\nLIBOR exposures and 2) transitioning ongoing\nactivities away from LIBOR. Our remediation of\nexisting LIBOR exposures is focused on\nproactively transitioning exposures from LIBOR\nto an alternative rate or incorporating LIBOR\ntransition language (\u201cfallback language\u201d) into\ncontracts to provide a contractual mechanism\nfor transitioning away from LIBOR upon its\ncessation. Our fallback language aligns with\nthe language recommended by the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) in our\nexisting lending contracts and the\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (\u201cISDA\u201d) in our derivative\ncontracts and agreements to the greatest\nextent possible.\n\nWe continue to focus our LIBOR transition\nefforts on:\n\n\u2022 monitoring established controls to prevent\nthe origination of LIBOR indexed instruments\n\n\u2022 working with impacted customers to remediate\nremaining LIBOR contracts\n\n\u2022 engaging with our clients, industry working\ngroups, and regulators\n                                              \n  105    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 monitoring federal legislation relevant to\nour portfolio\n\nThe majority of LIBOR contracts that we have\ntransitioned to alternative rates have\nemployed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d). In the U.S., SOFR has been selected\nas the preferred alternative rate by the ARRC\nfor certain U.S. dollar derivative and cash\ninstruments. We have proactively worked with\ncustomers and prepared our systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes to focus\noriginations on SOFR and other non-LIBOR rates\nand will continue to do so. While the majority\nof our non-LIBOR transactions have utilized\nSOFR, we have also employed credit sensitive\nalternative rates to LIBOR, to a limited\nextent, in response to customer demand. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, we have derivatives with a\nnotional value of $19.6 billion and commercial\nloans with a maximum potential exposure of\n$11.2 billion indexed to SOFR.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our contracts indexed\nto USD LIBOR that are scheduled to mature\nafter June 30, 2023 totaled $147.2 billion\nwhich includes the maximum potential exposure\nof commercial loans, notional amounts of\nderivatives and outstandings on other\ninstruments. To track transition status,\ninstruments are categorized based on whether\nthey have fallback language (which may or may\nnot adhere to the ISDA and ARRC standards) or\nhave either no fallback language or have not\nyet been assessed for fallback language.\nInstruments with no fallback language or those\nnot yet assessed represent a higher risk for\nnot transitioning from LIBOR by June 30, 2023.\nThe majority of the instruments maturing after\nJune 30, 2023 are derivatives and commercial\nloans, which are summarized in the table\nbelow.

Internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process designed by,\nor under the supervision of, the Company\u2019s\nprincipal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, and effected by the Company\u2019s Board\nof Directors, management and other personnel,\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for\nexternal reporting purposes in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nCapital One\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that the Company\u2019s receipts\nand expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the\nCompany\u2019s management and directors; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the\nCompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on its financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nManagement conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021, based on the framework in\n\u201c2013 Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework\u201d\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\n(\u201cCOSO\u201d), commonly referred to as the \u201c2013\nFramework.\u201d\n\nBased on this assessment, management concluded\nthat, as of December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting was\neffective based on the criteria established by\nCOSO in the 2013 Framework. Additionally,\nbased upon management\u2019s assessment, the\nCompany determined that there were no material\nweaknesses in its internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021, has been audited by Ernst &\nYoung LLP, an independent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in their\naccompanying report, which expresses an\nunqualified opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2021.\n                                     \n  /s/ RICHARD D.

Delaware\nCorporation established in 1994 and\nheadquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) offer a broad\narray of financial products and services to\nconsumers, small businesses and commercial\nclients through digital channels, branches,\nCaf\u00e9s and other distribution channels. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, our principal subsidiaries\nincluded:\n\u2022 Capital One Bank (USA), National Association\n(\u201cCOBNA\u201d), which offers credit card products\nalong with other lending products and consumer\nservices; and\n\u2022 Capital One, National Association (\u201cCONA\u201d),\nwhich offers a broad spectrum of banking\nproducts and financial services to consumers,\nsmall businesses and commercial clients.\nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d COBNA and CONA are\ncollectively referred to as the \u201cBanks.\u201d\nWe also offer products outside of the United\nStates of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) principally through\nCapital One (Europe) plc (\u201cCOEP\u201d), an indirect\nsubsidiary of COBNA organized and located in\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), and through a\nbranch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority,\namong other things, to provide credit card\nloans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has\nthe authority to provide credit card loans.\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into threemajor\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We\nprovide details on our business segments, the\nintegration of recent acquisitions, if any,\ninto our business segments and the allocation\nmethodologies and accounting policies used to\nderive our business segment results in \u201cNote\n17\u2014Business Segments and Revenue from\nContracts with Customers.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements have been prepared in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles\nin the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of\nthe consolidated financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and in the related\ndisclosures. These estimates are based on\ninformation available as of the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements. While\nmanagement makes its best judgments, actual\namounts or results could differ from these\nestimates. Certain prior period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current\nperiod presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Capital One Financial\nCorporation and all other entities in which we\nhave a controlling financial interest. We\ndetermine whether we have a controlling\nfinancial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting\ninterest entity (\u201cVOE\u201d) or a variable interest\nentity (\u201cVIE\u201d). All significant intercompany\naccount balances and transactions have been\neliminated.\nVoting Interest Entities\nVOEs are entities that have sufficient equity\nand provide the equity investors voting rights\nthat give them the power to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations.\nSince a controlling financial interest in an\nentity is typically obtained through ownership\nof a majority voting interest, we consolidate\nour majority-owned subsidiaries and other\nvoting interest entities in which we hold,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 50% of the\nvoting rights or where we exercise control\nthrough other contractual rights.\nInvestments in which we do not hold a\ncontrolling financial interest but have\nsignificant influence over the entity\u2019s\nfinancial and operating decisions are\naccounted for under the equity method. If we\ndo not have significant influence, we measure\nequity investments at fair value with changes\nin fair value recorded through net income,\nexcept those that do not have a readily\n                                              \n  127    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \ndeterminable fair value (for which a\nmeasurement alternative is applied). We report\nequity investments in other assets on our\nconsolidated balance sheets and include our\nshare of income or loss and dividends from\nthose investments in other non-interest income\nin our consolidated statements of income.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (i)\nlack sufficient equity to permit the entity to\nfinance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other\nparties; or (ii) have equity investors that do\nnot have the ability to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations\nthrough voting rights, or do not have the\nobligation to absorb the expected losses, or\ndo not have the right to receive the residual\nreturns of the entity. The entity that is\ndeemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE is\nrequired to consolidate the VIE. An entity is\ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE\nif that entity has both (i) the power to\ndirect the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses or the right to receive benefits that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE.\nIn determining whether we are the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE, we consider both\nqualitative and quantitative factors regarding\nthe nature, size and form of our involvement\nwith the VIE, such as our role in establishing\nthe VIE and our ongoing rights and\nresponsibilities; our economic interests,\nincluding debt and equity investments,\nservicing fees and other arrangements deemed\nto be variable interests in the VIE; the\ndesign of the VIE, including the\ncapitalization structure, subordination of\ninterests, payment priority, relative share of\ninterests held across various classes within\nthe VIE\u2019s capital structure and the reasons\nwhy the interests are held by us.\nWe perform on-going reassessments to evaluate\nwhether changes in an entity\u2019s capital\nstructure or changes in the nature of our\ninvolvement with the entity result in a change\nto the VIE designation or a change to our\nconsolidation conclusion. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Variable\nInterest Entities and Securitizations\u201d for\nfurther details.\nBalance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets\nand Liabilities\nDerivative contracts that we execute\nbilaterally in the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nmarket or are centrally cleared are generally\ngoverned by enforceable master netting\nagreements where we generally have the right\nto offset exposure with the same counterparty.\nEither counterparty can generally request to\nnet settle all contracts through a single\npayment upon default on, or termination of,\nany one contract. We elect to offset the\nderivative assets and liabilities under master\nnetting agreements for balance sheet\npresentation where a right of setoff exists.\nFor derivative contracts entered into under\nmaster netting agreements for which we have\nnot been able to confirm the enforceability of\nthe setoff rights, or those not subject to\nmaster netting agreements, we do not offset\nour derivative positions for balance sheet\npresentation. See \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities\u201d for more\ndetails.\nWe also elect to present securities purchased\nor sold under resale or repurchase agreements\non a net basis when a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement exists and other\napplicable criteria are met. Security\ncollateral received from or pledged to the\ncounterparties are not eligible for netting\nand are presented gross in our consolidated\nbalance sheet. See \u201cNote 8\u2014Deposits and\nBorrowings\u201d and \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities\u201d for more details.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and due\nfrom banks, interest-bearing deposits and\nother short-term investments, all of which, if\napplicable, have stated maturities of three\nmonths or less when acquired.\nSecurities Resale and Repurchase Agreements\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\nand securities loaned or sold under agreements\nto repurchase, principally U.S. government and\nagency obligations, are not accounted for as\nsales but as collateralized financing\ntransactions and recorded at the amounts at\nwhich the securities were acquired or sold,\nplus accrued interest. We continually monitor\nthe market value of these securities and\ndeliver additional collateral to or obtain\nadditional collateral from counterparties, as\nappropriate. See \u201cNote 8\u2014Deposits and\nBorrowings\u201d for further details.\n                                              \n  128    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nSignificant Accounting Policies Impacted by\nour Adoption of the CECL Standard\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the\nASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (\u201cCECL\nstandard\u201d) and updated the significant\naccounting policies described under the\n\u201cInvestments Securities\u201d and \u201cLoans\u201d sections\nbelow. In periods prior to 2020, the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses represented\nmanagement\u2019s estimate of incurred loan and\nlease losses as fully described in \u201cNote\n1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nInvestment Securities\nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of\nthe following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise or agency\n(\u201cAgency\u201d) and non-agency residential\nmortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d); Agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities\n(\u201cCMBS\u201d); and other securities. The accounting\nand measurement framework for our investment\nsecurities differs depending on the security\nclassification.\nWe classify securities as available for sale\nor held to maturity based on our investment\nstrategy and management\u2019s assessment of our\nintent and ability to hold the securities\nuntil maturity. We did not have any securities\nthat were classified as held to maturity as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\nWe report securities available for sale on our\nconsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The\namortized cost of investment securities\nreflects the amount for which the security was\nacquired, adjusted for accrued interest,\namortization of premiums, discounts, and net\ndeferred fees and costs, any applicable fair\nvalue hedge accounting adjustments, collection\nof cash, and charge-offs. Unrealized gains or\nlosses are recorded, net of tax, as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Unamortized premiums,\ndiscounts and other basis adjustments for\navailable for sale securities are generally\nrecognized in interest income over the\ncontractual lives of the securities using the\neffective interest method. However, premiums\non certain callable investment securities are\namortized to the earliest call date. We record\npurchases and sales of investment securities\navailable for sale on a trade date basis.\nRealized gains or losses from the sale of debt\nsecurities are computed using the first-in\nfirst-out method of identification, and are\nincluded in non-interest income in our\nconsolidated statements of income. We elect to\npresent accrued interest for securities\navailable for sale within interest receivable\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nAn individual debt security is impaired when\nthe fair value of the security is less than\nits amortized cost. If we intend to sell an\navailable for sale security in an unrealized\nloss position or it is more likely than not\nthat we will be required to sell the security\nprior to recovery of its amortized cost basis,\nany allowance for credit losses is reversed\nthrough our provision for credit losses and\nthe difference between the amortized cost\nbasis of the security and its fair value is\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nFor impaired debt securities that we have both\nthe intent and ability to hold, the securities\nare evaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. The allowance for credit losses on our\ninvestment securities is recognized through\nour provision for credit losses and limited by\nthe unrealized losses of a security measured\nas the difference between the security\u2019s\namortized cost and fair value. See further\ndiscussion below under the \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses - Available for Sale Investment\nSecurities\u201d section of this Note.\nOur investment portfolio also includes certain\ndebt securities that, at the time of purchase,\nhad experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Such debt securities are\naccounted for in accordance with accounting\nguidance for purchased financial assets with\ncredit deterioration and are herein referred\nto as purchased credit-deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d)\nsecurities.\nPCD securities require the recognition of an\nallowance for credit losses at the time of\nacquisition. The allowance for credit losses\nis not recognized in provision for credit\nlosses. Instead, the purchase price and the\ninitial allowance collectively represent the\namortized cost basis of a PCD security. Any\nnon-credit discount or premium at the date of\nacquisition is amortized into interest income\nover the remaining life of the security.\nSubsequent to the date of purchase, we\nremeasure the allowance for credit losses on\nthe amortized cost basis using the same\npolicies as for other debt securities\navailable for sale and changes are recognized\nthrough our provision for credit losses. See\nfurther discussion below under the \u201cAllowance\nfor Credit Losses - Available for Sale\nInvestment Securities\u201d section of this Note.\n                                              \n  129    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWe charge off any portion of an investment\nsecurity that we determine is uncollectible.\nThe amortized cost basis, excluding accrued\ninterest, is charged off through the allowance\nfor credit losses. Accrued interest is charged\noff as a reduction to interest income.\nRecoveries of previously charged off principal\namounts are recognized in our provision for\ncredit losses when received.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Available for\nSale Investment Securities\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\n(\u201callowance\u201d) that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\nover the contractual terms of our investment\nsecurities classified as available for sale.\nWhen an investment security available for sale\nis impaired due to credit factors, we\nrecognize a provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and an\nallowance for credit losses on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Credit losses\nrecognized in the allowance for credit losses\nare limited to the amount by which the\ninvestment security\u2019s amortized cost basis\nexceeds its fair value. Investment securities\nin unrealized gain positions do not have an\nallowance for credit losses as the investment\nsecurity could be sold at its fair value to\nprevent realization of credit losses. We\nexclude accrued interest from the fair value\nand amortized cost basis of an investment\nsecurity for purposes of measuring impairment.\nCharge-offs of uncollectible amounts of\ninvestment securities are deducted from the\nallowance for credit losses.\nFor certain of our securities available for\nsale, we have determined that there is no risk\nof impairment due to credit factors. These\ninvestment securities include high quality\ndebt instruments that are issued and\nguaranteed by the United States government and\nits agencies, certain government-sponsored\nenterprises, and certain foreign sovereign\ngovernments or supranational organizations.\nManagement performs periodic assessments to\nreevaluate this conclusion by considering any\nchanges in historical losses, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts.\nWe evaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at\nthe individual security level and determine\nwhether any portion of the decline in fair\nvalue is due to a credit loss. We make this\ndetermination through the use of quantitative\nand qualitative analyses. Our qualitative\nanalysis includes factors such as the extent\nto which fair value is less than amortized\ncost, any changes in the security\u2019s credit\nrating, past defaults or delayed payments, and\nadverse conditions impacting the security or\nissuer. A credit loss exists to the extent\nthat management does not expect to recover the\namortized cost basis.\nFor investment securities which require\nfurther assessment, we perform a quantitative\nanalysis using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology and compare the present value of\nexpected future cash flows from the security\navailable for sale to the security\u2019s amortized\ncost basis. Projected future cash flows\nreflect management\u2019s best estimate and are\nbased on our understanding of past events,\ncurrent conditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts, and are discounted by the\nsecurity\u2019s effective interest rate adjusted\nfor prepayments. The allowance for credit\nlosses for investment securities reflects the\ndifference by which the amortized cost basis\nexceeds the present value of future cash flows\nand is limited to the amount by which the\nsecurity\u2019s amortized cost exceeds its fair\nvalue. See \u201cNote 2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for\nadditional information.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for\ninvestment, including loans transferred to our\nconsolidated securitization trusts, and loans\nheld for sale and is divided into three\nportfolio segments: credit card, consumer\nbanking and commercial banking loans. Credit\ncard loans consist of domestic and\ninternational credit card loans. Consumer\nbanking loans consist of auto and retail\nbanking loans. Commercial banking loans\nconsist of commercial and multifamily real\nestate loans as well as commercial and\nindustrial loans.\n                                              \n  130    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nLoan Classification\nWe classify loans as held for investment or\nheld for sale based on our investment strategy\nand management\u2019s intent and ability with\nregard to the loans, which may change over\ntime. The accounting and measurement framework\nfor loans differs depending on the loan\nclassification, whether we elect the fair\nvalue option, whether the loans are originated\nor purchased and whether purchased loans are\nconsidered to have experienced a more-than-\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination. The presentation within the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows is based\non management\u2019s intent at acquisition or\norigination. Cash flows related to loans that\nare acquired or originated with the intent to\nhold for investment are included in cash flows\nfrom investing activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Cash flows related\nto loans that are acquired or originated with\nthe intent to sell are included in cash flows\nfrom operating activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\n\nLoans Held for Investment\n\nLoans that we have the ability and intent to\nhold for the foreseeable future and loans\nassociated with consolidated securitization\ntransactions are classified as held for\ninvestment. Loans classified as held for\ninvestment, except for credit card loans, are\nreported at their amortized cost basis,\nexcluding accrued interest. For these loans,\nwe elect to present accrued interest within\ninterest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For credit card loans\nclassified as held for investment, earned\nfinance charges and fees are included in\neither loans held for investment (if they have\nbeen billed to the customer) or interest\nreceivable (if they have not yet been billed\nto the customer).\n\nInterest income is recognized on performing\nloans on an accrual basis. We defer loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts on originated loans, premiums and\ndiscounts on purchased loans and loan\ncommitment fees. We recognize these amounts in\ninterest income as yield adjustments over the\nlife of the loan and/or commitment period\nusing the effective interest method. For\ncredit card loans, loan origination fees and\ndirect loan origination costs are amortized on\na straight-line basis over a 12-month period.\nThe amortized cost of loans held for\ninvestment is subject to our allowance for\ncredit losses methodology described below\nunder the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note.\n\nLoans Held for Sale\n\nLoans that we intend to sell or for which we\ndo not have the ability and intent to hold for\nthe foreseeable future are classified as held\nfor sale. Multifamily commercial real estate\nloans originated with the intent to sell to\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises are accounted\nfor under the fair value option. We elect the\nfair value option on these loans as part of\nour management of interest rate risk along\nwith the corresponding forward sale\ncommitments. Loan origination fees and direct\nloan origination costs are recognized as\nincurred and are reported in other non-\ninterest income in the consolidated statements\nof income. Interest income is calculated based\non the loan's stated rate of interest and is\nreported in interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of income. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nAll other loans classified as held for sale\nare recorded at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue. Loan origination fees, direct loan\norigination costs and any discounts and\npremiums are deferred until the loan is sold\nand are then recognized as part of the total\ngain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans\nheld for sale is determined on an aggregate\nportfolio basis for each loan type. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nIf a loan is transferred from held for\ninvestment to held for sale, then on the\ntransfer date, any decline in fair value\nrelated to credit is recorded as a charge-off\nand any allowance for credit losses is\nreversed through our provision for credit\nlosses. The loan is then reclassified to held\nfor sale at its amortized cost at the date of\nthe transfer. A valuation allowance is\nestablished, if needed, such that the loan\nheld for sale is recorded at the lower of cost\nor fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we\nreport write-downs or recoveries in fair value\nup to the carrying value at the date of\ntransfer and realized gains or losses on loans\nheld for sale in our consolidated statements\nof income as a component of other non-interest\nincome. We calculate the gain or loss on loan\nsales as the difference between the proceeds\nreceived and the carrying value of the loans\nsold, net of the fair value of any residual\ninterests retained.\n                                              \n  131    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nLoans Acquired\n\nAll purchased loans, including loans\ntransferred in a business combination, are\ninitially recorded at fair value, which\nincludes consideration of expected future\nlosses, as of the date of the acquisition. To\ndetermine the fair value of loans at\nacquisition, we estimate discounted\ncontractual cash flows due using an observable\nmarket rate of interest, when available,\nadjusted for factors that a market participant\nwould consider in determining fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, contractual cash flows\nare adjusted to include prepayment estimates\nbased upon historical payment trends,\nforecasted default rates and loss severities\nand other relevant factors. The difference\nbetween the fair value and the contractual\ncash flows is recorded as a loan premium or\ndiscount, which may relate to either credit or\nnon-credit factors, at acquisition.\n\nWe account for purchased loans under the\naccounting guidance for purchased financial\nassets with credit deterioration when, at the\ntime of purchase, the loans have experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination. We refer to\nthese loans which are accounted for under\naccounting guidance for purchased financial\nassets with more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination as \u201cPCD loans\u201d.\n\nWe recognize an allowance for credit losses on\npurchased loans that have not experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination at the time\nof purchase through earnings in a manner that\nis consistent with originated loans. The\npolicies relating to the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans is described below in the\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\u201d section of this Note.\nLoan Modifications and Restructurings\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide modifications to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty to improve\nlong-term collectability of the loan and to\navoid the need for foreclosure or repossession\nof collateral, if any. Our loan modifications\ntypically include short-term payment\ndeferrals, an extension of the loan term, a\nreduction in the interest rate, a reduction in\nthe loan balance, or a combination of these\nconcessions. A loan modification in which a\nconcession is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty is accounted\nfor and reported as a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d). See \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for\nadditional information on our loan\nmodifications and restructurings, including\nthose in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDelinquent and Nonperforming Loans\nThe entire balance of a loan is considered\ncontractually delinquent if the minimum\nrequired payment is not received by the first\nstatement cycle date equal to or following the\ndue date specified on the customer\u2019s billing\nstatement. Delinquency is reported on loans\nthat are 30or more days past due. Interest and\nfees continue to accrue on past due loans\nuntil the date the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, if applicable. For loan\nmodifications, delinquency and nonaccrual\nstatus are reported in accordance with the\nrevised terms of the loans. We generally place\nloans on nonaccrual status when we believe the\ncollectability of interest and principal is\nnot reasonably assured.\n\nNonperforming loans generally include loans\nthat have been placed on nonaccrual status.\nLoans classified as held for sale are excluded\nfrom nonperforming classification\nconsideration.\n\nOur policies for classifying loans as\nnonperforming, by loan category, are as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 C redit card loans: As permitted by\nregulatory guidance issued by the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council\n(\u201cFFIEC\u201d), our policy is generally to exempt\ncredit card loans from being classified as\nnonperforming, as these loans are generally\ncharged off in the period the account becomes\n180days past due. Consistent with industry\nconventions, we generally continue to accrue\ninterest and fees on delinquent credit card\nloans until the loans are charged off.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We classify consumer\nbanking loans as nonperforming when we\ndetermine that the collectability of all\ninterest and principal on the loan is not\nreasonably assured, generally when the loan\nbecomes 90days past due.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans : We classify\ncommercial banking loans as nonperforming as\nof the date we determine that the\ncollectability of all interest and principal\non the loan is not reasonably assured.\n                                              \n  132    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n\u2022 Modified loans and troubled debt\nrestructurings: Modified loans, including\nTDRs, that are current at the time of the\nrestructuring remain in accrual status if\nthere is demonstrated performance prior to the\nrestructuring and continued performance under\nthe modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the\nmodified loan is classified as nonperforming.\n\nInterest and fees accrued but not collected at\nthe date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status\nare reversed against earnings. In addition,\nthe amortization of deferred loan fees, costs,\npremiums and discounts is suspended. Interest\nand fee income are subsequently recognized\nonly upon the receipt of cash payments.\nHowever, if there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectability of loan principal,\ncash received is generally applied against the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status\nwhen all principal and interest is current and\nrepayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest is reasonably assured,\nor when the loan is both well-secured and in\nthe process of collection and collectability\nis no longer doubtful.\nCharge-Offs\nWe charge off loans when we determine that the\nloan is uncollectible. The amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, is charged\noff as a reduction to the allowance for credit\nlosses based on the time frames presented\nbelow. Accrued interest on loans other than\ncredit card loans determined to be\nuncollectible is reversed as a reduction of\ninterest income when the loan is classified as\nnonperforming. For credit card loans, accrued\ninterest is charged off simultaneously with\nthe charge off of other components of\namortized cost and as a reduction of interest\nincome. When received, recoveries of\npreviously charged off amounts are recorded as\nan increase to the allowance for credit losses\n(see the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note for\ninformation on how we account for expected\nrecoveries). Costs to recover charged off\nloans are recorded as collection expense and\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense as incurred. Our charge-off time\nframes by loan type are presented below.\n\n\u2022 Credit card loans : We generally charge off\ncredit card loans in the period the account\nbecomes 180days past due. We charge off\ndelinquent credit card loans for which\nrevolving privileges have been revoked as part\nof loan workout when the account becomes\n120days past due. Credit card loans in\nbankruptcy are generally charged off by the\nend of the month following 30days after the\nreceipt of a complete bankruptcy notification\nfrom the bankruptcy court. Credit card loans\nof deceased account holders are generally\ncharged off 5days after receipt of\nnotification.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We generally charge\noff consumer banking loans at the earlier of\nthe date when the account is a specified\nnumber of days past due or upon repossession\nof the underlying collateral. Our charge-off\nperiod for auto loans is 120days past due.\nSmall business banking loans generally charge\noff at 120days past due based on the date the\namortized cost basis is deemed uncollectible.\nAuto loans that have not been previously\ncharged off where the borrower has filed for\nbankruptcy and the loan has not been\nreaffirmed charge off in the period that the\nloan is 60days from the bankruptcy\nnotification date, regardless of delinquency\nstatus. Auto loans that have not been\npreviously charged off and have been\ndischarged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are\ncharged off at the end of the month in which\nthe bankruptcy discharge occurs. Remaining\nconsumer loans generally are charged off\nwithin 40days of receipt of notification from\nthe bankruptcy court. Consumer loans of\ndeceased account holders are charged off by\nthe end of the month following 60days of\nreceipt of notification.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans: We charge off\ncommercial loans in the period we determine\nthat the amortized cost basis is\nuncollectible.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\n(\u201callowance\u201d) that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\nover the contractual terms of our loans held\nfor investment. We measure the allowance on a\nquarterly basis through consideration of past\nevents, including historical experience,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts.\n\nWe measure current expected credit losses over\nthe contractual terms of our loans. The\ncontractual terms are adjusted for expected\nprepayments but are not extended for renewals\nor extensions, except when an extension or\nrenewal arises from a borrower option that is\nnot unconditionally cancellable or through a\nTDR that is reasonably expected to occur.\n                                              \n  133    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWe aggregate loans sharing similar risk\ncharacteristics into pools for purposes of\nmeasuring expected credit losses. Pools are\nreassessed periodically to confirm that all\nloans within each pool continue to share\nsimilar risk characteristics. Expected credit\nlosses for loans that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with other financial\nassets are measured individually.\n\nExpected recoveries of amounts previously\ncharged off or expected to be charged off are\nrecognized within the allowance, with a\ncorresponding reduction to our provision for\ncredit losses. At times expected recoveries\nmay result in a negative allowance. We limit\nthe allowance recovery expectations to amounts\npreviously charged off and expected to be\ncharged off. Charge-offs of uncollectible\namounts result in a reduction to the allowance\nand recoveries of previously charged off\namounts result in an increase to the\nallowance.\n\nWhen developing an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information, or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Significant judgment is\napplied to the development and duration of\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used in\nour estimation of lifetime losses. We estimate\nexpected credit losses over the duration of\nthose forecasts and then revert, on a rational\nand systematic basis, to historical losses at\neach relevant loss component of the estimate.\nExpected losses for contractual terms\nextending beyond the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast and reversion periods are\nbased on those historical losses.\n\nManagement will consider and may qualitatively\nadjust for conditions, changes and trends in\nloan portfolios that may not be captured in\nmodeled results. These adjustments are\nreferred to as qualitative factors and\nrepresent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses. Management\u2019s\njudgment may involve an assessment of current\nand forward-looking conditions including but\nnot limited to changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, nature and volume of the\nportfolio, external factors, and uncertainty\nas it relates to economic, model or forecast\nrisks, where not already captured in the\nmodeled results.\n\nExpected credit losses for collateral-\ndependent loans are based on the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral. When we intend to\nliquidate the collateral, the fair value of\nthe collateral is adjusted for expected costs\nto sell. A loan is deemed to be a collateral-\ndependent loan when (i) we determine\nforeclosure or repossession of the underlying\ncollateral is probable, or (ii) foreclosure or\nrepossession is not probable, but the borrower\nis experiencing financial difficulty and we\nexpect repayment to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the\ncollateral. The allowance for a collateral-\ndependent loan reflects the difference between\nthe loan\u2019s amortized cost basis and the fair\nvalue (less selling costs, where applicable)\nof the loan's underlying collateral.\n\nOur credit card and consumer banking loan\nportfolios consist of smaller-balance,\nhomogeneous loans. The consumer banking loan\nportfolio is divided into two primary\nportfolio segments: auto loans and retail\nbanking loans. The credit card and consumer\nbanking loan portfolios are further divided by\nour business units into groups based on common\nrisk characteristics, such as origination\nyear, contract type, interest rate, borrower\ncredit score and geography. The commercial\nbanking loan portfolio is primarily composed\nof larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans.\nThese loans are subject to reviews that result\nin internal risk ratings. In assessing the\nrisk rating of a particular commercial banking\nloan, among the factors we consider are the\nfinancial condition of the borrower,\ngeography, collateral performance, historical\nloss experience and industry-specific\ninformation that management believes is\nrelevant in determining and measuring expected\ncredit losses. Subjective assessment and\ninterpretation are involved. Emphasizing one\nfactor over another or considering additional\nfactors could impact the risk rating assigned\nto that commercial banking loan.\n\nFor consumer banking and commercial banking\nloans, the contractual period typically does\nnot include renewals or extensions because the\nrenewals and extensions are generally not at\nthe borrower\u2019s exclusive option to exercise.\nManagement has determined that the undrawn\ncredit exposure that is associated with our\ncredit card loans is unconditionally\ncancellable. For this reason, expected credit\nlosses are measured based on the drawn balance\nat each quarterly measurement date, but not on\nthe undrawn exposure. Because credit card\nloans do not have a defined contractual life,\nmanagement estimates both the volume and\napplication of payments to determine a\ncontractual life of the drawn balance at the\nmeasurement date over which expected credit\nlosses are developed for credit card loans.\n                                              \n  134    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWith the exception of credit card loans, we\nhave made a policy election to not measure an\nallowance on accrued interest for loans held\nfor investment because we reverse\nuncollectible accrued interest in a timely\nmanner. See the \u201cDelinquent and Nonperforming\nLoans\u201d and \u201cCharge-Offs - Loans\u201d sections of\nthis Note for information on what we consider\ntimely. For credit card loans, we do not make\nthis election, as we reserve for uncollectible\naccrued interest relating to credit card loans\nin the allowance.\n\nThe allowance related to credit card and\nconsumer banking loans assessed on a pooled\nbasis is based on a modeled calculation, which\nis supplemented by management judgment as\ndescribed above. Because of the homogeneous\nnature of our consumer loan portfolios, the\nallowance is based on the aggregated portfolio\nsegment evaluations. The allowance is\nestablished through a process that begins with\nestimates of historical losses in each pool\nbased upon various statistical analyses, with\nadjustments for current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions, which includes expected economic\nconditions. Loss forecast models are utilized\nto estimate expected credit losses and\nconsider several portfolio indicators\nincluding, but not limited to, expected\neconomic conditions, historical loss\nexperience, account seasoning, the value of\ncollateral underlying secured loans, estimated\nforeclosures or defaults based on observable\ntrends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings,\nunemployment, borrower credit scores and\ngeneral business trends. Management believes\nthese factors are relevant in estimating\nexpected credit losses and also considers an\nevaluation of overall portfolio credit quality\nbased on indicators such as changes in our\ncredit evaluation, underwriting and collection\nmanagement policies, the effect of other\nexternal factors such as competition and legal\nand regulatory requirements, general economic\nconditions and business trends, and\nuncertainties in forecasting and modeling\ntechniques used in estimating our allowance.\n\nThe allowance related to commercial banking\nloans assessed on a pooled basis is based on\nour historical loss experience for loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics and consideration\nof the current credit quality of the\nportfolio, which is supplemented by management\njudgment as described above. These are\nadjusted for current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions likely to cause future losses which\nvary from historical levels. We apply internal\nrisk ratings to commercial banking loans,\nwhich we use to assess credit quality and\nderive a total loss estimate based on an\nestimated probability of default (\u201cdefault\nrate\u201d) and loss given default (\u201closs\nseverity\u201d). Management may also apply judgment\nto adjust the loss factors derived, taking\ninto consideration both quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including general\neconomic conditions, industry-specific and\ngeographic trends, portfolio concentrations,\ntrends in internal credit quality indicators,\nand current and past underwriting standards\nthat have occurred but are not yet reflected\nin the historical data underlying our loss\nestimates.\n\nThe allowance related to smaller-balance\nhomogeneous credit card and consumer banking\nloans whose terms have been modified in a TDR\nis calculated on a pool basis using historical\nloss experience, adjusted for current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of conditions likely to cause future\nlosses which vary from historical levels for\nthe respective class of assets. The allowance\nrelated to consumer banking loans that are\nassessed at a loan-level is determined based\non key considerations that include the\nborrower\u2019s overall financial condition,\nresources and payment history, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, and when applicable, the estimated\nrealizable value of any collateral. The\nallowance related to commercial banking loans\nthat are assessed at a loan-level is generally\ndetermined in accordance with our policy for\nestimating expected credit losses for\ncollateral-dependent loans as described above.\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures\nIn addition to the allowance, we also measure\nexpected credit losses related to unfunded\nlending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable in our Commercial\nBanking business. This reserve is measured\nusing the same measurement objectives as the\nallowance for loans held for investment and is\nrecorded within other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. These commitments\nare segregated by risk according to our\ninternal risk rating scale, which we use to\nassess credit quality and derive an expected\ncredit loss estimate. We assess these risk\nclassifications, taking into consideration\nboth quantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of conditions likely to\ncause future losses which vary from historical\nlevels, and utilization assumptions to\nestimate the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Expected credit losses are not\nmeasured on unfunded lending commitments that\nare unconditionally cancellable, including all\nof our unfunded credit card and consumer\nbanking lending commitments and certain of our\nunfunded commercial banking lending\ncommitments.\n                                              \n  135    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nDetermining the appropriateness of the\nallowance and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is complex and requires judgment\nby management about the effect of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. Subsequent\nevaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of\nthe factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments in future\nperiods. See \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments\u201d for additional information.\nSecuritization of Loans\nOur loan securitization activities primarily\ninvolve the securitization of credit card and\nauto loans, which provides a source of funding\nfor us. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Variable Interest Entities\nand Securitizations\u201d for additional details.\nLoan securitization involves the transfer of a\npool of loan receivables from our portfolio to\na trust. The trust then sells undivided\ninterests in the pool of loan receivables to\nthird-party investors through the issuance of\ndebt securities and transfers the proceeds\nfrom the debt issuance to us as consideration\nfor the loan receivables transferred. The debt\nsecurities are collateralized by the loan\nreceivables transferred from our portfolio. We\nremove loans from our consolidated balance\nsheets if securitizations qualify as sales to\nunconsolidated VIEs, recognize assets retained\nand liabilities assumed at fair value and\nrecord a gain or loss on the transferred\nloans. Alternatively, if the transfer does not\nqualify as a sale but instead is considered a\nsecured borrowing, the assets will remain on\nour consolidated balance sheets with an\noffsetting liability recognized for the amount\nof proceeds received.\nPremises, Equipment and Leases\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold\nimprovements, are carried at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nLand is carried at cost. We capitalize direct\ncosts incurred during the application\ndevelopment stage of internally developed\nsoftware projects. Depreciation and\namortization expenses are calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets. Useful lives for premises\nand equipment are estimated as follows:\n                                              \n  Premises and          Useful Lives          \n  Equipment                                   \n  Buildings and         5-39years             \n  improvements                                \n  Furniture and         3-10years             \n  equipment                                   \n  Computer software     3years                \n  Leasehold             Lesser of the useful  \n  improvements          life or the           \n                        remaining lease term  \n                                              \nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are\nexpensed as incurred and gains or losses upon\ndisposition are recognized in our consolidated\nstatements of income as realized. See \u201cNote\n7\u2014Premises, Equipment and Leases\u201d for\nadditional information.\nLeases\nLease classification is determined at\ninception for all lease transactions with an\ninitial term greater than one year. Operating\nleases are included as right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d)\nassets within other assets, and operating\nlease liabilities are classified as other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets. Finance leases are included in\npremises and equipment, and other borrowings\non our consolidated balance sheets. Our\noperating lease expense is included in\noccupancy and equipment within non-interest\nexpense in our consolidated statements of\nincome. Lease expense for minimum lease\npayments are recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. See \u201cNote\n7\u2014Premises, Equipment and Leases\u201d for\nadditional information.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the\nacquisition price of an acquired business over\nthe fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed and is assigned to one or\nmore reporting units at the date of\nacquisition. A reporting unit is defined as an\noperating segment, or a business unit that is\none level below an operating segment. We have\nfourreporting units: Credit Card, Auto, Other\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for\nimpairment at the reporting unit level\nannually or more frequently if adverse\ncircumstances indicate that it is more likely\nthan not that the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value. These\nindicators could include a sustained,\nsignificant decline in the\n                                              \n  136    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nCompany\u2019s stock price, a decline in expected\nfuture cash flows, significant disposition\nactivity, a significant adverse change in the\neconomic or business environment, and the\ntesting for recoverability of a significant\nasset group, among others.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are\namortized on either an accelerated or\nstraight-line basis over their estimated\nuseful lives and are evaluated for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying amount of the assets may\nnot be recoverable. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and\nOther Intangible Assets\u201d for additional\ninformation.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) are\ninitially recorded at fair value when mortgage\nloans are sold or securitized in the secondary\nmarket and the right to service these loans is\nretained for a fee. Commercial MSRs are\nsubsequently accounted for under the\namortization method. We evaluate for\nimpairment as of each reporting date and\nrecognize any impairment in other non-interest\nincome. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets\u201d for additional information.\nForeclosed Property and Repossessed Assets\nForeclosed property and repossessed assets\nobtained through our lending activities\ntypically include commercial real estate or\npersonal property, such as automobiles, and\nare recorded at net realizable value. For\nforeclosed property and repossessed assets, we\ngenerally reclassify the loan to repossessed\nassets upon repossession of the property in\nsatisfaction of the loan. Net realizable value\nis the estimated fair value of the underlying\ncollateral less estimated selling costs and is\nbased on appraisals, when available.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, foreclosed\nproperty and repossessed assets are recorded\nat the lower of our initial cost basis or net\nrealizable value, which is routinely monitored\nand updated. Any changes in net realizable\nvalue and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of the property are recorded in\nother non-interest expense. See \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair\nValue Measurement\u201d for details.\nRestricted Equity Investments\nWe have investments in Federal Home Loan Bank\n(\u201cFHLB\u201d) stock and in Federal Reserve Bank\nstock. These investments, which are included\nin other assets on our consolidated balance\nsheets, are not marketable, are carried at\ncost, and are reviewed for impairment if there\nis any indicator of impairment.\nLitigation\nWe establish reserves for litigation-related\nmatters that arise from the ordinary course of\nour business activities when it is probable\nthat a loss associated with a claim or\nproceeding has been incurred and the amount of\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated.\nProfessional service fees, including lawyers\u2019\nand experts\u2019 fees, expected to be incurred in\nconnection with a loss contingency are\nexpensed as services are provided. See \u201cNote\n18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and\nOthers\u201d for additional information.\nCustomer Rewards Reserve\nWe offer products, primarily credit cards,\nwhich include programs that allow members to\nearn rewards based on account activity that\ncan be redeemed for cash (primarily in the\nform of statement credits), gift cards,\ntravel, or covering eligible charges. The\namount of reward that a customer earns varies\nbased on the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program and product. When rewards are\nearned by a customer, rewards expense is\ngenerally recorded as an offset to interchange\nincome, with a corresponding increase to the\ncustomer rewards reserve. The customer rewards\nreserve is computed based on the estimated\nfuture cost of earned rewards that are\nexpected to be redeemed and is reduced as\nrewards are redeemed. In estimating the\ncustomer rewards reserve, we consider\nhistorical redemption and spending behavior,\nas well as the terms and conditions of the\ncurrent rewards programs, among other factors.\nWe expect the vast majority of all rewards\nearned will eventually be redeemed. The\ncustomer rewards reserve, which is included in\nother liabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets, totaled $ 6.2billion and $ 5.4billion\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n                                              \n  137    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nRevenue Recognition\nInterest Income and Fees\nInterest income and fees on loans and\ninvestment securities are recognized based on\nthe contractual provisions of the underlying\narrangements.\nLoan origination fees,costs,premiums and\ndiscounts on loans held for investment are\ndeferred and generally amortized into interest\nincome as yield adjustments over the\ncontractual life and/or commitment period\nusing the effective interest method. Costs\ndeferred include, among other things,\nincentives paid to our network of auto dealers\nfor loan referrals. In certain circumstances,\nwe elect to factor prepayment estimates into\nthe calculation of the constant effective\nyield necessary to apply the interest method.\nPrepayment estimates are based on historical\nprepayment data, existing and forecasted\ninterest rates, and economic data. For credit\ncard loans, loan origination fees and direct\nloan origination costs are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over a 12-month period.\nUnamortized premiums, discounts and other\nbasis adjustments on investment securities are\ngenerally recognized in interest income over\nthe contractual lives of the securities using\nthe effective interest method. However,\npremiums for certain callable investment\nsecurities are amortized to the earliest call\ndate.\nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare recorded in revenue when earned and\npresented on our consolidated balance sheets\nwithin either loan receivables (if they have\nbeen billed to the customer) or interest\nreceivable (if they have not yet been billed\nto the customer). Finance charges and fees on\ncredit card loans are not recorded after the\naccount is charged off. Annual membership fees\nare classified as service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees in our consolidated\nstatements of income and are deferred and\namortized into income over 12months on a\nstraight-line basis.\nInterchange Income\nInterchange income generally represents fees\nfor standing ready to authorize and providing\nsettlement on credit and debit card\ntransactions processed through the MasterCard\u00ae\n(\u201cMasterCard\u201d) and Visa\u00ae (\u201cVisa\u201d) interchange\nnetworks. The levels and structure of\ninterchange rates set by MasterCard and Visa\ncan vary based on cardholder purchase volumes,\namong other factors. We recognize interchange\nincome upon settlement. See \u201cNote 17\u2014Business\nSegments and Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers\u201d for additional details.\nCard Partnership Agreements\nWe have contractual agreements with certain\nretailers and other partners to provide\nlending and other services to mutual\ncustomers. We primarily issue private-label\nand cobrand credit card loans to these\ncustomers over the terms of the partnership\nagreements.\nCertain partners assist in or perform\nmarketing activities on our behalf and promote\nour products and services to their customers.\nAs compensation for providing these services,\nwe often pay royalties, bounties or other\nspecial bonuses to these partners. Our\npayments to partners are generally recorded as\nreductions of revenue or as marketing\nexpenses, depending on their nature. Our\ncredit card partnership agreements may also\nprovide for profit or revenue sharing payments\nwhich are presented as a reduction of the\nrelated revenue line item(s) when owed to the\npartner.\nWhen a partner agrees to share a portion of\nthe credit losses associated with the\npartnership, we evaluate the contractual\nprovisions for the loss share payments as well\nas applicable accounting guidance to determine\nwhether to present the sharing of losses on a\ngross or net basis in our consolidated\nfinancial statements. When loss sharing\namounts due from partners are presented on a\nnet basis, they are recorded as a reduction to\nour provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and reduce\nthe charge-off amounts that we report. The\nallowance for credit losses attributable to\nthese portfolios is also reduced by the\nexpected reimbursements from these partners\nfor loss sharing amounts. See \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for additional\ninformation related to our loss sharing\narrangements.\n                                              \n  138    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nCollaborative Arrangements\nA collaborative arrangement is a contractual\narrangement that involves a joint operating\nactivity between two or more parties that are\nactive participants in the activity. These\nparties are exposed to significant risks and\nrewards based upon the economic success of the\njoint operating activity. We assess each of\nour partnership agreements with profit,\nrevenue or loss sharing payments to determine\nif a collaborative arrangement exists and, if\nso, how revenue generated from third parties,\ncosts incurred and transactions between\nparticipants in the collaborative arrangement\nshould be accounted for and reported on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nWe currently have one partnership agreement\nthat meets the definition of a collaborative\nagreement. We share a fixed percentage of\nrevenues, consisting of finance charges and\nlate fees, with the partner, and the partner\nis required to reimburse us for a fixed\npercentage of credit losses incurred. Revenues\nand losses related to the partner\u2019s credit\ncard program and partnership agreement are\nreported on a net basis in our consolidated\nfinancial statements. Revenue sharing amounts\nattributable to the partner are recorded as an\noffset against total net revenue in our\nconsolidated statements of income. Interest\nincome was reduced by $ 1.0billion, $\n1.1billion and $ 1.0billion in December 31,\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for amounts\nearned by the partner pursuant to the\npartnership agreement. The impact of all of\nour loss sharing arrangements that are\npresented on a net basis is included in \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments.\u201d\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe are authorized to issue stock\u2013based\ncompensation to employees and directors in\nvarious forms, primarily as restricted stock\nunits (\u201cRSUs\u201d), performance share units and\nstock options. In addition, we also issue cash\nequity units and cash-settled restricted stock\nunits which are not counted against the common\nshares reserved for issuance or available for\nissuance because they are settled in cash.\nFor awards settled in shares, we generally\nrecognize compensation expense on a straight-\nline basis over the award\u2019s requisite service\nperiod based on the fair value of the award at\nthe grant date. If an award settled in shares\ncontains a performance condition with graded\nvesting, we recognize compensation expense\nusing the accelerated attribution method.\nEquity units and restricted stock units that\nare cash-settled are accounted for as\nliability awards which results in quarterly\nexpense fluctuations based on changes in our\nstock price through the date that the awards\nare settled. Awards to participants that are\neligible for retirement or become eligible\nduring the vesting period are expensed\nimmediately or over the time period between\nthe grant date and when the participant\nbecomes retirement eligible, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense is included\nin salaries and associate benefits in the\nconsolidated statements of income.\nFor RSUs and performance share units, the fair\nvalue of stock-based compensation used in\ndetermining compensation expense will\ngenerally equal the fair market value of our\ncommon stock on the date of grant. Stock-based\ncompensation expense for equity classified\nstock options is based on the grant date fair\nvalue, which is estimated using a Black-\nScholes option pricing model. Certain share-\nsettled awards have discretionary vesting\nconditions which result in the remeasurement\nof these awards at fair value each reporting\nperiod and the potential for compensation\nexpense to fluctuate with changes in our stock\nprice. See \u201cNote 13\u2014Stock-Based Compensation\nPlans\u201d for additional details.\nMarketing Expenses\nMarketing expense includes the cost of our\nvarious promotional efforts to attract and\nretain customers such as advertising,\npromotional materials, and certain customer\nincentives, including spend-based bonuses. We\nexpense marketing costs as incurred.\n                                              \n  139    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize the current and deferred tax\nconsequences of all transactions that have\nbeen recognized in the financial statements\nusing the provisions of the enacted tax laws.\nCurrent income tax expense represents our\nestimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period and includes income tax expense\nrelated to our uncertain tax positions, as\nwell as tax-related interest and penalties.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that will be in\neffect when the differences are expected to\nreverse. We record valuation allowances to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. We\nrecord the effect of remeasuring deferred tax\nassets and liabilities due to a change in tax\nrates or laws as a component of income tax\nexpense related to continuing operations for\nthe period in which the change is enacted. We\nsubsequently release income tax effects\nstranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach.\nIncome tax benefits are recognized when, based\non their technical merits, they are more\nlikely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination. The amount recognized is the\nlargest amount of benefit that is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement. See\n\u201cNote 15\u2014Income Taxes\u201d for additional details.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated and reported\nunder the \u201ctwo-class\u201d method. The \u201ctwo-class\u201d\nmethod is an earnings allocation method under\nwhich earnings per share is calculated for\neach class of common stock and participating\nsecurity considering both dividends declared\nor accumulated and participation rights in\nundistributed earnings as if all such earnings\nhad been distributed during the period. We\nhave unvested share-based payment awards which\nhave a right to receive non-forfeitable\ndividends, which are deemed to be\nparticipating securities.\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by\ndividing net income, after deducting dividends\non preferred stock and participating\nsecurities as well as undistributed earnings\nallocated to participating securities, by the\naverage number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period, net of any treasury shares.\nWe calculate diluted earnings per share in a\nsimilar manner after consideration of the\npotential dilutive effect of common stock\nequivalents on the average number of common\nshares outstanding during the period. Common\nstock equivalents include warrants, stock\noptions, restricted stock awards and units,\nand performance share awards and units. Common\nstock equivalents are calculated based upon\nthe treasury stock method using an average\nmarket price of common shares during the\nperiod. Dilution is not considered when a net\nloss is reported. Common stock equivalents\nthat have an antidilutive effect are excluded\nfrom the computation of diluted earnings per\nshare. See \u201cNote 12\u2014Earnings Per Common Share\u201d\nfor additional details.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAll derivative financial instruments, whether\ndesignated for hedge accounting or not, are\nreported at their fair value on our\nconsolidated balance sheets as either assets\nor liabilities, with consideration of legally\nenforceable master netting agreements that\nallow us to net settle positive and negative\npositions and offset cash collateral with the\nsame counterparty. We report net derivatives\nin a gain position, or derivative assets, on\nour consolidated balance sheets as a component\nof other assets. We report net derivatives in\na loss position, or derivative liabilities, on\nour consolidated balance sheets as a component\nof other liabilities. See \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities\u201d for\nadditional details.\n                                              \n  140    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFair Value\nFair value, also referred to as an exit price,\nis defined as the price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non whether the inputs to the valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value are\nobservable or unobservable. Fair value\nmeasurement of a financial asset or liability\nis assigned to a level based on the lowest\nlevel of any input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement in its entirety. The\nthree levels of the fair value hierarchy are\ndescribed below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nrequires that we maximize the use of\nobservable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance also provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes to fair value in the\nconsolidated statements of income. See \u201cNote\n16\u2014Fair Value Measurement\u201d for additional\ninformation.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nWe account for business combinations under the\nacquisition method of accounting. Under the\nacquisition method, tangible and intangible\nidentifiable assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed and any noncontrolling interest in the\nacquiree are recorded at fair value as of the\nacquisition date, with limited exceptions.\nTransaction costs and costs to restructure the\nacquired company are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill is recognized as the excess of the\nacquisition price over the estimated fair\nvalue of the identifiable net assets acquired.\nLikewise, if the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is greater than the acquisition\nprice, a bargain purchase gain is recognized\nand recorded in other non-interest income.\nIf the acquired set of activities and assets\ndo not meet the accounting definition of a\nbusiness, the transaction is accounted for as\nan asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition,\nthe assets acquired are recorded at the\npurchase price plus any transaction costs\nincurred and no goodwill is recognized.\n                                              \n  141    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nAccounting Standards Adopted During the Twelve\nMonths Ended December 31, 2021\n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                                We adopted    \n                                this          \n                                guidance in   \n  Income Tax                    the first     \n  Accounting                    quarter of    \n  Simplifica\u2026                   2021 using    \n  ASU No.                       the modified  \n  2019-12,       Simplifies     retrospecti\u2026  \n  Income         various        and           \n  Taxes          aspects of     prospective   \n  (Topic         the            methods of    \n  740):Simpl\u2026    guidance on    adoption.     \n  the            accounting     Our adoption  \n  Accounting     for income     of this       \n  for Income     taxes.         standard did  \n  Taxes                         not have a    \n  Issued                        material      \n  December                      impact on     \n  2019                          our           \n                                consolidated  \n                                financial     \n                                statements.   \n                                              \n                                              \n  142    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                \n  NOTE 2\u2014INVESTMENT SECURITIES  \n                                \nOur investment securities portfolio consists\nof the following: U.S. government-sponsored\nenterprise or agency (\u201cAgency\u201d) and non-agency\nresidential mortgage-backed securities\n(\u201cRMBS\u201d), Agency commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities (\u201cCMBS\u201d), U.S. Treasury securities\nand other securities.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses for commercial loans. Generally,\nloans that are designated as criticized\nperforming and criticized nonperforming are\nreviewed quarterly by management to determine\nif they are appropriately classified/rated and\nwhether any impairment exists. Noncriticized\nloans are also generally reviewed, at least\nannually, to determine the appropriate risk\nrating. In addition, we evaluate the risk\nrating during the renewal process of any loan\nor if a loan becomes past due.\n                                              \n  151    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020.

This may include internal\ninformation, external information or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nFor credit card loans, accrued interest is\ncharged off simultaneously with the charge off\nof other components of amortized cost as a\nreduction of revenue. Total net revenue was\nreduced by $ 629million and $ 1.1billion in\n2021 and 2020, respectively for finance\ncharges and fees charged-off as uncollectible\nand by $ 1.4billion in 2019 for the estimated\nuncollectible amount of billed finance charges\nand fees and related losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d for further discussion of the\nmethodology and policy for determining our\nallowance for credit losses for each of our\nloan portfolio segments, as well as\ninformation on our reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the years ended December 31, 2021,\n2020 and 2019. Our allowance for credit losses\ndecreased by $ 4.1billion to $ 11.4billion as\nof December 31, 2021 from 2020, primarily\ndriven by strong credit performance and an\nimproved economic outlook.\n

Represents foreign currency translation\nadjustments.\n\n(3) Concurrent with our adoption of the CECL\nstandard in the first quarter of 2020, we\nreclassified our finance charge and fee\nreserve to our allowance for credit losses,\nwith a corresponding increase to credit card\nloans held for investment.\n\n(4) Includes an allowance release of $\n327million for a partnership credit card loan\nportfolio transferred to held for sale in the\nthird quarter of 2020.\n\n(5) Represents foreign currency translation\nadjustments and an initial allowance for\npurchased credit-deteriorated loans of $\n6million.\nCredit Card Partnership Loss Sharing\nArrangements\nWe have certain credit card partnership\nagreements that are presented within our\nconsolidated financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses. See \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\u201d for further discussion of\nour credit card partnership agreements.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in the\nestimated reimbursements from these partners\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020\nand 2019.\nTable 4.2: Summary of Credit Card Partnership\nLoss Sharing Arrangements Impacts\n                                              \n                Year                          \n               Ended                          \n  (Dol\u2026       Decem\u2026                          \n  in             31,                          \n  mill\u2026         2021        2020        2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Esti\u2026                                       \n  reim\u2026                                       \n  from                                        \n  part\u2026    $   2,159    $  2,166    $    379  \n  begi\u2026                                       \n  of                                          \n  peri\u2026                                       \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  due                                         \n  from                                        \n  part\u2026         -438        -959        -600  \n  which                                       \n  redu\u2026                                       \n  net                                         \n  char\u2026                                       \n  Amou\u2026                                       \n  expe\u2026                                       \n  to                                          \n  beco\u2026                                       \n  due                                         \n  from                                        \n  (to)                                        \n  part\u2026         -271         952       1,383  \n  which                                       \n  redu\u2026                                       \n  (inc\u2026                                       \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  for                                         \n  cred\u2026                                       \n  loss\u2026                                       \n  Esti\u2026                                       \n  reim\u2026                                       \n  from                                        \n  part\u2026    $   1,450    $  2,159    $  1,162  \n  end                                         \n  of                                          \n  peri\u2026                                       \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Includes effects from adoption of the CECL\nstandard in the first quarter of 2020.\n                                              \n  160    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                         \n  NOTE 5\u2014VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND  \n  SECURITIZATIONS                        \n                                         \nIn the normal course of business, we enter\ninto various types of transactions with\nentities that are considered to be variable\ninterest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which have provided a source of funding\nfor us and enabled us to transfer a certain\nportion of the economic risk of the loans or\nrelated debt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet the maximum amount of any remaining\nfunding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020. We separately\npresent information for consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       27       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       53       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  161    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       17       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       43       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities owned by the VIE, which\nincludes the seller\u2019s interest and repurchased\nnotes held by other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.2billion of assets and $\n568million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2021, and $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n596million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2020.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to government-\nsponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service\nthe transferred loans pursuant to the\nguidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an\ninvestor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and\nABS in our investment securities portfolio,\nwhich represent variable interests in the\nrespective securitization trusts from which\nthose securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either invest in securities issued by\nthe VIE and were not involved in the design of\nthe VIE or no transfers have occurred between\nthe VIE and us.

Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritization involves the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain investments in qualified\naffordable housing projects using the\nproportional amortization method if certain\ncriteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2020, we recognized amortization of $\n633million and $ 556million, respectively, and\ntax credits of $ 644million and $ 607million,\nrespectively, associated with these\ninvestments within income tax provision. The\ncarrying value of our equity investments in\nthese qualified affordable housing projects\nwas $ 4.7billion and $ 4.5billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We\nare periodically required to provide\nadditional financial or other support during\nthe period of the investments. Our liability\nfor these unfunded commitments was $\n1.7billion and $ 1.5billion as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively, and is largely\nexpected to be paid from 2022 to 2024.\n                                              \n  163    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.8billion and $ 4.6billion as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. The creditors of\nthe VIEs have no recourse to our general\ncredit and we do not provide additional\nfinancial or other support other than during\nthe period that we are contractually required\nto provide it. The total assets of the\nunconsolidated VIE investment funds were\napproximately $ 11.9billion and $ 11.0billion\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.1billion and $ 2.0billion as\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nare reflected on our consolidated balance\nsheets in cash, loans held for investment, and\nother assets. The liabilities are reflected in\nother liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs\nhave no recourse to our general credit. We\nhave not provided additional financial or\nother support other than during the period\nthat we are contractually required to provide\nit.\n\nOther\n\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We were not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance.

An impairment of a\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is determined based\non the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value exceeds its fair value, limited\nto the amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit.\n\nThe fair value of reporting units is\ncalculated using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology, a form of the income approach.\nThe calculation uses projected cash flows\nbased on each reporting unit\u2019s internal\nforecast and uses the perpetuity growth method\nto calculate terminal values. These cash flows\nand terminal values are then discounted using\nappropriate discount rates, which are largely\nbased on our external cost of equity with\nadjustments for risk inherent in each\nreporting unit. Capital is allocated based on\neach reporting unit\u2019s specific regulatory\ncapital requirements, economic capital\nrequirements, and underlying risks.\nConsolidated stockholder\u2019s equity in excess of\nthe sum of all reporting unit\u2019s capital\nrequirements that is not identified for future\ncapital needs, such as dividends, share\nbuybacks, or other strategic initiatives, is\nallocated to the reporting units and the Other\ncategory and assumed distributed to equity\nholders in future periods. Our discounted cash\nflow analysis requires management to make\njudgments about future loan and deposit\ngrowth, revenue growth, credit losses, and\ncapital rates. The reasonableness of our fair\nvalue calculation is assessed by reference to\na market-based approach using comparable\nmarket multiples and recent market\ntransactions where available.\n                                              \n  166    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nIntangible Assets\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we\nrecorded intangible assets that include PCCR\nintangibles, sponsorship, customer and\nmerchant relationships, partnership, trade\nnames, and other customer contract\nintangibles.

A majority of our\nleases are operating leases of office space,\nretail bank branches and Caf\u00e9s. For real\nestate leases, we have elected to account for\nthe lease and non-lease components together as\na single lease component. Our operating leases\nexpire at various dates through 2071, and many\nof them require variable lease payments by us,\nof property taxes, insurance premiums, common\narea maintenance and other costs. Certain of\nthese leases also have extension or\ntermination options, and we assess the\nlikelihood of exercising such options. If it\nis reasonably certain that we will exercise\nthe options, then we include the impact in the\nmeasurement of our right-of-use assets and\nlease liabilities.\nOur right-of-use assets and lease liabilities\nfor operating leases are included in other\nassetsand other liabilitieson our consolidated\nbalance sheets. As most of our operating\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, we use\nour incremental borrowing rate in determining\nthe present value of lease payments. Our\noperating lease expense is included in\noccupancy and equipment within non-interest\nexpense in our consolidated statements of\nincome. Total operating lease expense consists\nof operating lease cost, which is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term,\nand variable lease cost, which is recognized\nbased on actual amounts incurred. We also\nsublease certain premises, and sublease income\nis included in other non-interest income in\nour consolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables present information about\nour operating lease portfolio and the related\nlease costs as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 7.2 Operating Lease Portfolio\n                                              \n

overall risk\nmanagement activities. Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency swaps to hedge, but we may\nalso use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We then enter\ninto derivative contracts with counterparties\nto economically hedge substantially all of our\nsubsequent exposures.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the forecasted transactions\nimpact earnings and presented in the same line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income\nas the earnings effect of the hedged items.\nOur cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps\nand floors that are intended to hedge the\nvariability in interest receipts or interest\npayments on some of our variable-rate\nfinancial assets or liabilities. We also enter\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  172    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that stems from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in OTC markets.\nWe also execute interest rate and commodity\nfutures in the exchange-traded derivative\nmarkets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both\ntrades cleared through central counterparty\nclearinghouses (\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared\nbilateral contracts. The Chicago Mercantile\nExchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the Intercontinental\nExchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH Group (\u201cLCH\u201d) are\nour CCPs for our centrally cleared contracts.\nIn our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter\ninto agreements directly with our derivative\ncounterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements, where applicable, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. We exchange collateral in\ntwo primary forms: variation margin, which\nmitigates the risk of changes in value due to\ndaily market movements and is exchanged daily,\nand initial margin, which mitigates the risk\nof potential future exposure of a derivative\nand is exchanged at the outset of a\ntransaction and adjusted daily. We exchange\nboth variation margin and initial margin for\ncleared and uncleared bilateral contracts. The\namount of collateral exchanged for variation\nmargin is dependent upon the fair value of the\nderivative instruments as well as the fair\nvalue of the pledged collateral and will vary\nover time as market variables change. The\namount of the initial margin exchanged is\ndependent upon 1) the calculation of initial\nmargin exposure, as prescribed by 1a) the U.S.\nprudential regulators\u2019 margin rules for\nuncleared derivatives (\u201cPR Rules\u201d) or 1b) the\nCCPs for cleared derivatives and 2) the fair\nvalue of the pledged collateral; it will vary\nover time as market variables change. When\nvaluing collateral, an estimate of the\nvariation in price and liquidity over time is\nsubtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d to\ndiscount the value of the collateral pledged.\nOur exposure to derivative counterparty credit\nrisk, at any point in time, is equal to the\namount reported as a derivative asset on our\nbalance sheet. The fair value of our\nderivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis\nto take into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand any associated collateral received or\npledged. See Table 9.3 for our net exposure\nassociated with derivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. We also clear exchange-traded\ninstruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures\ncommission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the\nintermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require\nthat we post initial and variation margin\nthrough our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-\npayment or default. Initial margin is required\nby CCPs as collateral against potential losses\non our exchange-traded and cleared derivative\ncontracts and variation margin is exchanged on\na daily basis to account for mark-to-market\nchanges in those derivative contracts. For\nCME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives,\nvariation margin cash payments are required to\nbe characterized as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with bilateral derivative\ncounterparties, where applicable, to mitigate\nthe risk of default. These bilateral\nagreements typically provide the right to\noffset exposure with the same counterparty and\nrequire the party in a net liability position\nto post collateral. Agreements with certain\nbilateral counterparties require both parties\nto maintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of uncleared derivatives exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty. We also\nrecord debit valuation adjustments (\u201cDVAs\u201d) to\nadjust the fair values of our derivative\nliabilities to reflect the impact of our own\ncredit quality.\n                                              \n  173    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nBalance Sheet Presentation\nThe following table summarizes the notional\namounts and fair values of our derivative\ninstruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nwhich are segregated by derivatives that are\ndesignated as accounting hedges and those that\nare not, and are further segregated by type of\ncontract within those two categories.

                               \nRegulation and Capital Adequacy\nThe Company and the Banks are subject to the\nregulatory capital requirements established by\nthe Federal Reserve and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d)\nrespectively (the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d).\nThe Basel III Capital Rules implement certain\ncapital requirements published by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel\nCommittee\u201d), along with certain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and other capital\nprovisions. Moreover, the Banks, as insured\ndepository institutions, are subject to prompt\ncorrective action (\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations,\nwhich require the Federal Reserve, OCC and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(collectively, the \u201cFederal Banking Agencies\u201d)\nto take prompt corrective action for banks\nthat do not meet PCA capital requirements.\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5% , a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%\n. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer and countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirements, as described\nbelow.\nFollowing amendments to the Basel III Capital\nRules in October 2019 by the Federal Banking\nAgencies to provide for tailored application\nof certain capital requirements across\ndifferent categories of banking institutions\n(the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d), the Company, as a\nbank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nbut less than $700 billion and not exceeding\nany of the applicable risk-based thresholds,\nis a Category III institution.\nAs a Category III institution, effective\nJanuary 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches framework\nand certain associated capital requirements,\nand we have elected to exclude certain\nelements of AOCI from our regulatory capital\nas permitted for a Category III institution.\nWe remain subject to the countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirement (which is currently\nset at 0%) and supplementary leverage ratio\nrequirement of 3.0%.\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe \u201cG-SIB Surcharge.\u201d We are not a G-SIB\nbased on the most recent available data and\nthus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (the \u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that\nprovides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the current expected credit loss\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) standard on their regulatory capital\n(the \u201cCECL Transition Election\u201d). We adopted\nthe CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as\nof January 1, 2020, and made the CECL\nTransition Election (for regulatory capital\npurposes) in the first quarter of 2020.\nTherefore, the applicable amounts presented in\nthis Report reflect such election.\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

As of December 31,\n2021, under the Amended and Restated 2004\nStock Incentive plan (\u201c2004 Plan\u201d), we are\nauthorized to issue 67million common shares in\nvarious forms, primarily share-settled RSUs,\nperformance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), and non-\nqualified stock options. Of this amount,\napproximately 17million shares remain\navailable for future issuance as of December\n31, 2021. The 2004 Plan permits the use of\nnewly issued shares or treasury shares upon\nthe settlement of options and stock-based\nincentive awards, and we generally settle by\nissuing new shares.\nWe also issue cash-settled restricted stock\nunits. These cash-settled units are not\ncounted against the common shares authorized\nfor issuance or available for issuance under\nthe 2004 Plan. Cash-settled units vesting\nduring 2021, 2020 and 2019 resulted in cash\npayments to associates of $ 7million, $\n12million and $ 15million, respectively. There\nwas no unrecognized compensation cost for\nunvested cash-settled units as of December 31,\n2021.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\nrecognized during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n331million, $ 203million and $ 239million,\nrespectively. The total income tax benefit for\nstock-based compensation recognized during\n2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 62million, $\n43million and $ 50million, respectively.\nIn addition, we maintain an Associate Stock\nPurchase Plan (\u201cPurchase Plan\u201d), which is a\ncompensatory plan under the accounting\nguidance for stock-based compensation. Related\nto the Purchase Plan, we recognized\ncompensation expense of $ 33million, $\n30million and $ 25million for 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. We also maintain a\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan,\nwhich allows participating stockholders to\npurchase additional shares of our common stock\nthrough automatic reinvestment of dividends or\noptional cash investments.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Share\nUnits\nRSUs represent share-settled awards that do\nnot contain performance conditions and are\ngranted to certain employees at no cost to the\nrecipient. RSUs generally vest over three\nyearsfrom the date of grant; however, some\nRSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the first\nor third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs\nare subject to forfeiture until certain\nrestrictions have lapsed, including continued\nemployment for a specified period of time.\nPSUs represent share-settled awards that\ncontain performance conditions and are granted\nto certain employees at no cost to the\nrecipient. PSUs generally vest over three\nyearsfrom the date of grant; however, some\nPSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the third\nanniversary of the grant date. The number of\nPSUs that step vest over three yearscan be\nreduced by 50% or 100% depending on whether\nspecific performance goals are met during the\nvesting period. The number of three-yearcliff\nvesting PSUs that will ultimately vest is\ncontingent upon meeting specific performance\ngoals over a three-yearperiod. These PSUs also\ninclude an opportunity to receive from 0% to\n150% of the target number of common shares.\nA recipient of an RSU or PSU is entitled to\nreceive a share of common stock after the\napplicable restrictions lapse and is generally\nentitled to receive cash payments or\nadditional shares of common stock equivalent\nto any dividends paid on the underlying common\nstock during the period the RSU or PSU is\noutstanding, but is not entitled to voting\nrights. Generally, the value of RSUs and PSUs\nwill equal the fair value of our common stock\non the date of grant and the expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period. Certain\nPSUs have discretionary vesting conditions and\nare remeasured at fair value each reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  189    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe following table presents a summary of 2021\nactivity for RSUs and PSUs.\nTable 13.1: Summary of Restricted Stock Units\nand Performance Share Units\n                                              \n                    Wei\u2026               Weig\u2026  \n                    Gra\u2026               Grant  \n                    Date                Date  \n         Res\u2026       Fair    Per\u2026        Fair  \n  (S\u2026    Sto\u2026       Val\u2026    Sha\u2026       Value  \n  in     Uni\u2026        per    Uni\u2026         per  \n  th\u2026    Uni\u2026       Unit    Uni\u2026        Unit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Un\u2026                                         \n  as                                          \n  of     3,8\u2026    $  86.\u2026    1,7\u2026    $  96.15  \n  Ja\u2026                                         \n  1,                                          \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Gr\u2026    2,1\u2026       127\u2026     873       112.\u2026  \n  Ve\u2026    -1,\u2026       90.\u2026    -760       98.74  \n  Fo\u2026    -246       105\u2026    -109       101.\u2026  \n  Un\u2026                                         \n  as                                          \n  of     4,1\u2026    $  104\u2026    1,7\u2026    $  102.\u2026  \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,                                         \n  20\u2026                                         \n                                              \n_________\n(1) Granted and vested include adjustments for\nachievement of specific performance goals for\nperformance share units granted in prior\nperiods.\n(2) The weighted-average grant date fair value\nof RSUs was $ 92.04and $ 83.29in 2020 and\n2019, respectively.

Investment\nstrategies and asset allocations are based on\ncareful consideration of plan liabilities, the\nplan\u2019s funded status and our financial\ncondition. Investment performance and asset\nallocation are measured and monitored on a\ndaily basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our plan\nassets totaled $ 279million and $ 280million,\nrespectively. We invested substantially all\nour plan assets in common collective trusts,\nwhich primarily consist of domestic and\ninternational equity securities, government\nsecurities and corporate and municipal bonds.\nOur plan assets were classified as Level 2 in\nthe fair value hierarchy as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020. For information on fair value\nmeasurements, including descriptions of Level\n1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the\nvaluation methods we utilize, see \u201cNote\n16\u2014Fair Value Measurement.\u201d\nExpected Future Benefit Payments\nAs of December 31, 2021, the benefits expected\nto be paid in the next ten years totaled $\n108million for our defined pension benefit\nplans and $ 12million for our other\npostretirement benefit plan, respectively.\n                                              \n  192    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                        \n  NOTE\u00a015\u2014INCOME TAXES  \n                        \nWe recognize the current and deferred tax\nconsequences of all transactions that have\nbeen recognized in the financial statements\nusing the provisions of the enacted tax laws.\nCurrent income tax expense represents our\nestimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period and includes income tax expense\nrelated to our uncertain tax positions, as\nwell as tax-related interest and penalties.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that will be in\neffect when the differences are expected to\nreverse. We record valuation allowances to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. We\nrecord the effect of remeasuring deferred tax\nassets and liabilities due to a change in tax\nrates or laws as a component of income tax\nexpense related to continuing operations for\nthe period in which the change is enacted. We\nsubsequently release income tax effects\nstranded in AOCI using a portfolio approach.\nIncome tax benefits are recognized when, based\non their technical merits, they are more\nlikely than not to be sustained upon\nexamination. The amount recognized is the\nlargest amount of benefit that is more likely\nthan not to be realized upon settlement.\nThe following table presents significant\ncomponents of the provision for income taxes\nattributable to continuing operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 15.1: Significant Components of the\nProvision for Income Taxes Attributable to\nContinuing Operations\n                                              \n                Year                          \n               Ended                          \n  (Dol\u2026       Decem\u2026                          \n  in             31,                          \n  mill\u2026         2021        2020        2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Curr\u2026                                       \n  inco\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026    $   2,173    $  1,676    $  1,207  \n  taxes                                       \n  State          485         370         301  \n  taxes                                       \n  Inte\u2026          152          67         129  \n  taxes                                       \n  Total                                       \n  curr\u2026    $   2,810    $  2,113    $  1,637  \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  Defe\u2026                                       \n  inco\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  (ben\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026    $     490    $  -1,3\u2026    $   -222  \n  taxes                                       \n  State           91        -266         -45  \n  taxes                                       \n  Inte\u2026           24          -4         -29  \n  taxes                                       \n  Total                                       \n  defe\u2026          605       -1,6\u2026        -296  \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  (ben\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  inco\u2026    $   3,415    $    486    $  1,341  \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n                                              \nThe international income tax provision is\nrelated to pre-tax earnings from foreign\noperations of approximately $ 677million, $\n293million and $ 215million in 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively.\nTotal income tax provision does not reflect\nthe tax effects of items that are included in\nAOCI, which include a tax benefit of $\n985million in 2021 and tax provisions of $\n702million and $ 727million in 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.

\nOur gross federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards were $ 25million and $ 36million\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. These operating loss\ncarryforwards were attributable to\nacquisitions and will expire from 2029 to\n2037, though $ 20million has no expiration.\nUnder IRS rules, our ability to utilize these\nlosses against future income is limited. The\nnet tax values of our state net operating loss\ncarryforwards were $ 258million and $\n250million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively, and they will expire from 2022\nto 2040. Our foreign tax credit carryforwards\nwere $ 91million and $ 56million as of\nDecember 31, 2021and 2020, respectively, and\nthey will expire from 2028 to 2031.\n\nOur valuation allowance increased by $\n59million to $ 355million as of December 31,\n2021 compared to $ 296million as of December\n31, 2020. Of the total increase, $ 35million\nis related to the current year increase in our\nforeign tax credit carryforwards that will not\nbe realized prior to expiration. The remaining\nincrease of $ 24million is related to reducing\nstate net operating losses and interest\ncarryforwards to the amount we have determined\nis more likely than not to be realized.\n\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties\nrelated to income taxes as a component of\nincome tax expense. We recognized a $\n30million tax benefit in 2021 and $ 16million\nand $ 4million of such expense in 2020 and\n2019, respectively.\nThe following table presents the accrued\nbalance of tax, interest

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following describes the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nInvestment Securities\nWe measure the fair value of our U.S. Treasury\nsecurities using quoted prices in active\nmarkets. For the majority of securities in\nother investment categories, we utilize\nmultiple vendor pricing services to obtain\nfair value measurements. We use a waterfall of\npricing vendors determined using our annual\nassessment of pricing service performance. A\npricing service may be considered as the\npreferred or primary pricing provider\ndepending on how closely aligned its prices\nare to other vendor prices, and how consistent\nthe prices are with other available market\ninformation. The price of each security is\nconfirmed by comparing such price to other\nvendor prices before it is finalized.\nRMBS and CMBS are generally classified as\nLevel 2 or 3. When significant assumptions are\nnot consistently observable, fair values are\nderived using the best available data. Such\ndata may include quotes provided by dealers,\nvaluation from external pricing services,\nindependent pricing models, or other model-\nbased valuation techniques, for example,\ncalculation of the present values of future\ncash flows incorporating assumptions such as\nbenchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds,\ncredit ratings and losses. Generally, the\nexternal pricing services utilize observable\nmarket data to the extent available. Pricing\nmodels may be used, which can vary by asset\nclass, and may also incorporate available\ntrade, bid and other market information.\nAcross asset classes, information such as\ntrader/dealer inputs, credit spreads, forward\ncurves and prepayment speeds are used to help\ndetermine appropriate valuations. Because many\nfixed income securities do not trade on a\ndaily basis, the pricing models may apply\navailable information through processes such\nas benchmarking curves, grouping securities\nbased on their characteristics and using\nmatrix pricing to prepare valuations. In\naddition, model processes are used by the\npricing services to develop prepayment\nassumptions.\nWe validate the pricing obtained from the\nprimary pricing providers through comparison\nof pricing to additional sources, including\nother pricing services, dealer pricing\nindications in transaction results and other\ninternal sources. Pricing variances among\ndifferent pricing sources are analyzed.\nAdditionally, on an on-going basis, we request\nmore detailed information from the valuation\nvendors to understand the pricing methodology\nand assumptions used to value the securities.\n                                              \n  197    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nWe use both exchange-traded and OTC\nderivatives to manage our interest rate,\nforeign currency and commodity risk exposures.\nWhen quoted market prices are available and\nused to value our exchange-traded derivatives,\nwe classify them as Level 1. However, the\nmajority of our derivatives do not have\nreadily available quoted market prices.\nTherefore, we value most of our derivatives\nusing vendor-based models. We primarily rely\non market observable inputs for these models,\nincluding, for example, interest rate yield\ncurves, credit curves, option volatility and\ncurrency rates. These inputs can vary\ndepending on the type of derivatives and\nnature of the underlying rate, price or index\nupon which the value of the derivative is\nbased. We typically classify derivatives as\nLevel 2 when significant inputs can be\nobserved in a liquid market and the model\nitself does not require significant judgment.\nWhen instruments are traded in less liquid\nmarkets and significant inputs are\nunobservable, such as interest rate swaps\nwhose remaining terms do not correlate with\nmarket observable interest rate yield curves,\nsuch derivatives are classified as Level 3. We\nconsider the impact of credit risk valuation\nadjustments when measuring the fair value of\nderivative contracts in order to reflect the\ncredit quality of the counterparty and our own\ncredit quality. Official internal pricing is\ncompared against additional pricing sources\nsuch as external valuation agents and other\ninternal sources. Pricing variances among\ndifferent pricing sources are analyzed and\nvalidated. These derivatives are included in\nother assets or other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nLoans Held for Sale\nIn our commercial business, we originate\nmultifamily commercial real estate loans with\nthe intent to sell them to GSEs. Beginning in\nthe fourth quarter of 2019, we elected the\nfair value option for such loans as part of\nour management of interest rate risk in our\nmultifamily agency business. These held for\nsale loans are valued based on market\nobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nas Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses on\nthese loans are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nRetained Interests in Securitizations\nWe have retained interests in various mortgage\nsecuritizations from previous acquisitions.\nOur retained interests primarily include\ninterest-only bonds and negative amortization\nbonds. We record these retained interests at\nfair value using market indications and\nvaluation models to calculate the present\nvalue of future cash flows. The models\nincorporate various assumptions that market\nparticipants use in estimating future cash\nflows including voluntary prepayment rate,\ndiscount rate, default rate and loss severity.\nDue to the use of significant unobservable\ninputs, retained interests in securitizations\nare classified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Assets\nWe offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan to eligible associates. In\naddition to participant deferrals, we make\ncontributions to the plan. Participants invest\nthese contributions in a variety of publicly\ntraded mutual funds. The plan assets, which\nconsist of publicly traded mutual funds, are\nclassified as Level 1.\n\nThe determination of the leveling of financial\ninstruments in the fair value hierarchy is\nperformed at the end of each reporting period.\nWe consider all available information,\nincluding observable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and\nsignificant inputs. Based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or\ninstrument category, judgments are made\nregarding the significance of the observable\nor unobservable inputs to the instruments\u2019\nfair value measurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions.\n                                              \n  198    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe following table displays our assets and\nliabilities measured on our consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 16.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       9      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       6       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents balance sheet netting of\nderivative assets and liabilities, and related\npayables and receivables for cash collateral\nheld or placed with the same counterparty.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity or\ncredit spreads, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. In\naddition, an increase in default rates would\ngenerally be accompanied by a decrease in\nrecovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an\nincrease in liquidity spreads.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements\n\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

(for\nexample, from the application of lower of cost\nor fair value accounting or when an impairment\nis identified). The following describes the\nvaluation techniques used in estimating the\nfair value of our financial assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis.\n                                              \n  202    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nNet Loans Held for Investment\nLoans held for investment that are recorded at\nfair value on our consolidated balance sheets\non a nonrecurring basis largely consist of\nimpaired loans for which impairment is\nmeasured based upon the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral. The fair value is\ndetermined using appraisal values that are\nobtained from independent appraisers, broker\npricing opinions or other available market\ninformation, adjusted for the estimated cost\nto sell. Due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs, these loans are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy. Fair value adjustments for\nindividually impaired collateralized loans\nheld for investment are recorded in provision\nfor credit losses in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale for which we have not\nelected the fair value option are carried at\nthe lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred\nfees and deferred origination costs, or fair\nvalue. These loans held for sale are valued\nbased on market observable inputs and are\ntherefore classified as Level 2. Fair value\nadjustments to these loans are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income.\nOther Assets\nOther assets subject to nonrecurring fair\nvalue measurements include equity investments\naccounted for under the measurement\nalternative, other repossessed assets and\nlong-lived assets held for sale. The assets\nheld for sale are carried at the lower of the\ncarrying amount or fair value less costs to\nsell. The fair value is determined based on\nthe appraisal value, listing price of the\nproperty or collateral provided by independent\nappraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated\ncosts to sell. Due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs, these assets are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy. Fair value adjustments for these\nassets are recorded in other non-interest\nexpense in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe following table presents the carrying\nvalue of the assets measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and still held as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, and for which a\nnonrecurring fair value measurement was\nrecorded during the year then ended.\nTable 16.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value\nMeasurements\n                                              \n              Dece\u2026                           \n                31,                           \n               2021                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n              Esti\u2026                           \n               Fair                    Total  \n              Value                           \n              Hier\u2026                           \n  (Dol\u2026       Level        Level              \n  in              2            3              \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held     $      0    $     194    $    194  \n  for                                         \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held          118            0         118  \n  for                                         \n  sale                                        \n  Other           0          325         325  \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total    $    118    $     519    $    637  \n                                              \n                                              \n              Dece\u2026                           \n                31,                           \n               2020                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n              Esti\u2026                           \n               Fair                    Total  \n              Value                           \n              Hier\u2026                           \n  (Dol\u2026       Level        Level              \n  in              2            3              \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held     $      0    $     305    $    305  \n  for                                         \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Other           0          175         175  \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total    $      0    $     480    $    480  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) As of December 31, 2021, other assets\nincluded equity method investments of $\n50million, investments accounted for under\nmeasurement alternative of $ 29million,\nrepossessed assets of $ 40million and long-\nlived assets held for sale of $ 206million.

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a segment are included in the Other\ncategory.\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom.\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our customers typically include\ncompanies with annual revenues between $\n20million and $ 2billion.\n\u2022 Other category: Includes the residual impact\nof the allocation of our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group activities, such as management\nof our corporate investment portfolio and\nasset/liability management, to our business\nsegments. Accordingly, net gains and losses on\nour investment securities portfolio and\ncertain trading activities are included in the\nOther category. Other category also includes\nforeign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign\ncurrency-denominated transactions; unallocated\ncorporate expenses that do not directly\nsupport the operations of the business\nsegments or for which the business segments\nare not considered financially accountable in\nevaluating their performance, such as certain\nrestructuring charges; certain material items\nthat are non-recurring in nature; offsets\nrelated to certain line-item\nreclassifications; and residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess provides a funds credit for sources of\nfunds, such as deposits generated by our\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a funds charge for the use of\nfunds by each segment. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate third-party rates. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.\nThe following is additional information on the\nprinciples and methodologies used in preparing\nour business segment results.\n\u2022 Net interest income: Interest income from\nloans held for investment and interest expense\nfrom deposits and other interest-bearing\nliabilities are reflected within each\napplicable business segment. Because funding\nand asset/liability management are managed\ncentrally by our Corporate Treasury group, net\ninterest income for our business segments also\nincludes the results of a funds transfer\npricing process that is intended to allocate a\ncost of funds used or credit for funds\nprovided to all business segment assets and\nliabilities, respectively, using a matched\nfunding concept. The taxable-equivalent\nbenefit of tax-exempt products is also\nallocated to each business unit with a\ncorresponding increase in income tax expense.\n                                              \n  206    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n\u2022 Non-interest income: Non-interest fees and\nother revenue associated with loans or\ncustomers managed by each business segment and\nother direct revenues are accounted for within\neach business segment.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses: The provision\nfor credit losses is directly attributable to\nthe business segment in accordance with the\nloans each business segment manages.\n\n\u2022 Non-interest expense: Non-interest expenses\ndirectly managed and incurred by a business\nsegment are accounted for within each business\nsegment. We allocate certain non-interest\nexpenses indirectly incurred by business\nsegments, such as corporate support functions,\nto each business segment based on various\nfactors, including the actual cost of the\nservices from the service providers, the\nutilization of the services, the number of\nemployees or other relevant factors.\n\n\u2022 Goodwill and other intangible assets:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that are\nnot directly attributable to business segments\nare assigned to business segments based on the\nrelative fair value of each segment.\nIntangible amortization is included in the\nresults of the applicable segment.\n\n\u2022 Income taxes: Income taxes are assessed for\neach business segment based on a standard tax\nrate with the residual tax expense or benefit\nto arrive at the consolidated effective tax\nrate included in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Loans held for investment: Loans are\nreported within each business segment based on\nproduct or customer type served by that\nbusiness segment.\n\n\u2022 Deposits: Deposits are reported within each\nbusiness segment based on product or customer\ntype served by that business segment.\nSegment Results and Reconciliation\nWe may periodically change our business\nsegments or reclassify business segment\nresults based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies or changes\nin organizational alignment.

The contractual amount of these\ncommitments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to us should the counterparty draw\nupon the commitment. We generally manage the\npotential risk of unfunded lending commitments\nby limiting the total amount of arrangements,\nmonitoring the size and maturity structure of\nthese portfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020. The carrying value represents our\nreserve and deferred revenue on legally\nbinding commitments.\nTable 18.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments\n                                              \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n  \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026          N\u2026          N\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Includes $ 3.9billion and $ 1.8billion of\nadvised lines of credit as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(2) These financial guarantees have expiration\ndates that range from 2021 to 2023 as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\nLoss Sharing Agreements\nWithin our Commercial Banking business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans with the intent to sell them to the\nGSEs.

Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2021 are approximately $\n200million. Our reserve and reasonably\npossible loss estimates involve considerable\njudgment and reflect that there is still\nsignificant uncertainty regarding numerous\nfactors that may impact the ultimate loss\nlevels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlitigation matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and the range of reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed here. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in these matters,\nespecially those involving governmental\nagencies, and the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these matters, there\nis significant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these litigation\nmatters and an adverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be material to our\nresults of operations or cash flows for any\nparticular reporting period.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds settlements for its member\nbanks, and any settlements related to\nMasterCard-allocated losses have either\nalready been paid or are reflected in our\nreserves.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we\nare subject to numerous legal proceedings and\nother inquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We were named as a\ndefendant in approximately 75putative consumer\nclass action cases (primarily in U.S. courts\nwith cases also in Canadian courts) alleging\nharm from the Cybersecurity Incident and\nseeking various remedies, including monetary\nand injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege\nbreach of contract, negligence, violations of\nvarious privacy laws and a variety of other\nlegal causes of action. The U.S. consumer\nclass actions have been consolidated for\npretrial proceedings before a multi-district\nlitigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia,\nAlexandria Division. In the third quarter of\n2020, the MDL court denied in part and granted\nin part Capital One\u2019s motion to dismiss and\npermitted pretrial discovery to continue. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2021, the parties agreed\nto a settlement of the U.S. consumer\n                                              \n  212    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nclass action cases for $ 190million, which was\ncovered by the Company's legal reserve for\nthis matter. The parties are in the process of\nseeking the required court approval of the\nclass settlement.\n\nSecurities class action . The Company and\ncertain officers have also been named as\ndefendants in a putative class action pending\nin the MDL alleging violations of certain\nfederal securities laws in connection with\nstatements and alleged omissions in securities\nfilings relating to our information security\nstandards and practices. The complaint seeks\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief. The Company\u2019s motion\nto dismiss the case is pending.\n\nGovernmental inquiries . We have received\ninquiries and requests for information\nrelating to the Cybersecurity Incident from\nCongress, federal regulators, relevant\nCanadian regulators, the Department of\nJustice, and the offices of approximately\nfourteen state Attorneys General. We have\ncooperated with these offices and responded to\ntheir inquiries.\n\nIn August 2020, we entered into consent orders\nwith the Federal Reserve and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) resulting\nfrom regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity\nIncident and relating to ongoing enhancements\nof our cybersecurity and operational risk\nmanagement processes. We paid an $ 80million\npenalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the\nOCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement\ndid not contain a monetary penalty.\nTaxi Medallion Finance Investigations\nBeginning in 2019, we have received subpoenas\nfrom the New York Attorney General\u2019s office\nand from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nSouthern District of New York, Civil and\nCriminal Divisions, relating to investigations\nof the taxi medallion finance industry we\nexited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek,\namong other things, information regarding our\nlending counterparties and practices. We are\ncooperating with these investigations.\nU.K. PPI Litigation\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received\ncustomer complaints and regulatory claims\nrelating to PPI. COEP has materially resolved\nthe PPI complaints and regulatory claims\nreceived prior to the deadline. Some of the\nclaimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims\nprocess have subsequently initiated legal\nproceedings, seeking additional redress. We\nare responding to these proceedings as we\nreceive them.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  213    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n
