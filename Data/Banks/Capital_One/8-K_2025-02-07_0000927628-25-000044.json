Appointment\nof Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements\nof Certain Officers.\n(e) On February 4, 2025, the Compensation\nCommittee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) and the\nindependent members of the Board of Directors\n(the \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d) of Capital One\nFinancial Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) approved\nthe 2025 compensation plans for Mr. Richard D.\nFairbank, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and the Company\u2019s other\ncurrent executives who are named executive\nofficers (the \u201cNamed Executive Officers\u201d).\nConsistent with the Company\u2019s long-standing\npractice, the compensation plans take effect\nimmediately and are designed to directly link\nMr. Fairbank\u2019s and the Named Executive\nOfficers\u2019 compensation with the Company\u2019s\nperformance over multiple time horizons and to\nalign their interests with the interests of\nthe Company\u2019s stockholders. In addition, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\napproved incentive awards to Mr. Fairbank and\nthe Named Executive Officers for the 2024\nperformance year.\n\n2024 Incentive Award for the Chief Executive\nOfficer\n\nIn February 2024, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors approved a 2024\ncompensation plan for Mr. Fairbank that\nincluded the opportunity to receive a year-end\nincentive award in early 2025 based on the\nCompany\u2019s actual performance in 2024. Any such\naward would consist of performance share\nawards, and also could consist of deferred\ncash, an equity-based award, or both. The\nCommittee\u2019s and the Independent Directors\u2019\ndetermination regarding whether to make the\nyear-end incentive award, the form of the\nawards and the value of the awards, was based\non a qualitative evaluation of multiple\nfactors, and all awards are completely at-risk\nbased on the Company\u2019s performance. After\nevaluating the Company\u2019s performance in 2024,\non February 4, 2025, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors approved a year-end\nincentive award to Mr. Fairbank totaling $31.0\nmillion. The awards consist of:\n\n1. Performance share awards with an\napproximate aggregate value of $20.5 million\n(\"CEO Performance Shares\"), under which Mr.\nFairbank may receive from 0% to 150% of a\ntotal target number of 102,440 shares of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock based on the Company\u2019s\nperformance over the three-year period from\nJanuary 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027\n(\u201cPerformance Period\u201d). Approximately $18.25\nmillion of the CEO Performance Shares (the\n\u201cFinancial PSUs\u201d) will vest based on the\nCompany's performance against a combination of\ntwo metrics: Common Dividends plus Growth of\nTangible Book Value per share (\u201cGrowth of\nShareholder Value\u201d) and Adjusted Return on\nTangible Common Equity (\u201cAdjusted ROTCE\u201d) and\napproximately $2.25 million of the CEO\nPerformance Shares will vest based entirely on\nthe Company's total shareholder return (\"TSR\")\nrelative to the Company's peers over the\nPerformance Period (the \"TSR PSUs\"), as\npreviously described in the Proxy Statement\nfor the 2024 Annual Stockholder Meeting (the\n\u201c2024 Proxy Statement\u201d). Each of the relevant\nperformance metrics will be assessed relative\nto a peer group consisting of companies in the\nKBW Bank Sector index, excluding custody\nbanks. After the end of the Performance\nPeriod, the Committee will certify the\nCompany\u2019s performance and issue the\ncorresponding number of shares of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock, if any, for each of\nthe performance share awards.\n\n2. A deferred cash bonus in the amount of $5.5\nmillion. The deferred cash bonus is\nmandatorily deferred for three years into the\nCompany\u2019s Voluntary Non-Qualified Deferred\nCompensation Plan and will pay out in the\nfirst calendar quarter of 2028.\n\n3. A grant of 24,986 restricted stock units\n(\u201cRSUs\u201d) with a grant date value of $5.0\nmillion. The RSUs will vest in full on\nFebruary 15, 2028, and settle in cash based on\nthe Company\u2019s average stock price over the\nfifteen trading days preceding the vesting\ndate. The RSUs are subject to the same\nperformance-based vesting provisions as\ndescribed in the 2024 Proxy Statement with\nrespect to the cash-settled RSUs granted to\nMr. Fairbank in February 2024.\n\n2025 Compensation Plan for the Chief Executive\nOfficer\n\nOn February 4, 2025, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors approved a structure for\nMr. Fairbank\u2019s 2025 compensation plan that is\nsubstantially similar to the structure of Mr.\nFairbank\u2019s 2024 compensation plan and consists\nof an equity-based award in the form of RSUs\nand an opportunity to receive a year-end\nincentive award in early 2026 based on the\nCompany\u2019s actual performance in 2025. Similar\nto Mr. Fairbank\u2019s 2024 plan, the awards\nprovided for under the 2025 plan are\ncompletely at-risk based on the Company\u2019s\nperformance, with payout opportunities\ndeferred for three years. As in previous\ncompensation plans for Mr. Fairbank, the 2025\ncompensation plan does not provide for a cash\nsalary.\n                      1                       \nUnder the plan, on February 4, 2025, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\ngranted Mr. Fairbank 12,493 RSUs with a grant\ndate value of $2.5 million that will vest in\nfull on February 15, 2028 and settle in cash\nbased on the Company\u2019s average stock price\nover the fifteen trading days preceding the\nvesting date.\n\nMr. Fairbank also has an opportunity to\nreceive a year-end incentive award in early\n2026 based on the Company\u2019s actual performance\nin 2025 and Mr. Fairbank's contributions to\nsuch performance, solely at the discretion of\nthe Committee and the Independent Directors.\nAny such award (a) will consist of performance\nshare awards, under which he may receive from\n0% to 150% of a target number of shares of the\nCompany\u2019s common stock based on the Company\u2019s\nperformance over the three year period from\nJanuary 1, 2026 through December 31, 2028, and\n(b) may also consist of deferred cash, an\nequity-based award, or both. The Committee and\nthe Independent Directors will have sole\ndiscretion on whether to make the year-end\nincentive award, the form of the awards and\nthe value of the awards. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors will base these\ndeterminations on a qualitative evaluation of\nmultiple factors, and any such awards will be\ncompletely at-risk based on the Company\u2019s\nperformance.\n\n2024 Incentive Awards for the Named Executive\nOfficers\n\nOn February 4, 2025, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors granted the Named\nExecutive Officers awards that consisted of a\ncash incentive award, stock-settled RSUs, and\nperformance shares in recognition of the\nCompany\u2019s and the executives\u2019 performance in\n2024. The terms and conditions of these cash\nincentive and equity awards are substantially\nthe same as the awards granted to the Named\nExecutive Officers, as described in the 2024\nProxy Statement. Specifically, the stock-\nsettled RSUs are subject to the same\nperformance-based vesting provisions as\ndescribed in the 2024 Proxy Statement with\nrespect to the stock-settled RSUs granted to\nthe Named Executive Officers in February 2024.\nThe number of performance shares earned at\nvesting is based on relative performance and\nabsolute performance measures, as described in\nthe 2024 Proxy Statement with respect to the\nperformance shares granted to the Named\nExecutive Officers in February 2024.\n\n2025 Compensation Plan for the Named Executive\nOfficers\n\nOn February 4, 2025, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors approved a 2025\ncompensation plan for the Named Executive\nOfficers, other than Mr. Fairbank, that is\nsubstantially similar to the structure of\nNamed Executive Officers\u2019 2024 compensation\nplan. The total target compensation for 2025\nfor such Named Executive Officers ranges\nbetween approximately $5.5 million and $7.3\nmillion and consists of:\n\n1. Approximately 20% of the total target\ncompensation for each Named Executive Officer\nwill be paid as regular cash salary throughout\nthe performance year.\n\n2. Approximately 25% of the total target\ncompensation for each Named Executive Officer\nwill consist of an opportunity to receive a\ncash incentive award in early 2026. The amount\nof any such cash incentive award will be\ndetermined solely in the discretion of the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors based\non a variety of company performance factors\nassessing the Company\u2019s actual performance in\n2025.\n\n3. The remaining approximately 55% of the\ntotal target compensation for each Named\nExecutive Officer is expected to consist of\nequity incentive awards in the form of (a)\nrestricted stock units that settle in shares\nof the Company\u2019s common stock and (b)\nperformance share awards. The equity incentive\nawards will be subject to substantially the\nsame terms and conditions as the equity\nincentive awards granted to the Named\nExecutive Officers in 2024, as described in\nthe 2024 Proxy Statement, and the awards, if\nany, will be granted to the Named Executive\nOfficers in early 2026 solely in the\ndiscretion of the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors and will be completely\nat-risk based on the individual executive\u2019s\nperformance in 2025.\n                                              \n  Item 9.01                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  Financial Statements and Exhibits.          \n                                              \n(d) Exhibits\n                                              \n  Exhibit No.    Description                  \n                 The cover page from this     \n  104            Current Report on Form 8-K,  \n                 formatted in Inline XBRL     \n                                              \n                      2                       \n                                              \n                  SIGNATURE                   \n                                              \nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly\ncaused this Current Report on Form 8-K to be\nsigned on its behalf by the undersigned\nhereunto duly authorized.\n                                              \n                 CAPITAL ONE                  \n  Date:          FINANCIAL                    \n  February 7,    CORPORATION    /s/ Matthew   \n  2025           By:            W.
