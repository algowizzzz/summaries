The following MD&A is\nprovided as a supplement to, and should be\nread in conjunction with, our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes in this\nReport and the more detailed information\ncontained in our 2022 Form 10-K.\n                \n  INTRODUCTION  \n                \nCapital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware\ncorporation established in 1994 and\nheadquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cCapital One\u201d)\noffer a broad array of financial products and\nservices to consumers, small businesses and\ncommercial clients through digital channels,\nbranch locations, caf\u00e9s and other distribution\nchannels.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, Capital One\nFinancial Corporation\u2019s principal operating\nsubsidiary was Capital One, National\nAssociation (\u201cCONA\u201d). On October 1, 2022, the\nCompany completed the merger of Capital One\nBank (USA), National Association (\u201cCOBNA\u201d),\nwith and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving\nentity (the \u201cBank Merger\u201d). The Company is\nhereafter collectively referred to as \u201cwe,\u201d\n\u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d References to the \u201cBank\u201d shall\nmean and refer to (i) CONA from and after the\nBank Merger and (ii) CONA and COBNA\ncollectively prior to the Bank Merger.\n\nOur consolidated total net revenues are\nderived primarily from lending to consumer and\ncommercial customers net of funding costs\nassociated with deposits, long-term debt and\nother borrowings. We also earn non-interest\nincome which primarily consists of interchange\nincome, net of reward expenses, service\ncharges and other customer-related fees. Our\nexpenses primarily consist of the provision\nfor credit losses, operating expenses,\nmarketing expenses and income taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customers served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio and asset/liability management by\nour centralized Corporate Treasury group, are\nincluded in the Other category. The Other\ncategory also includes unallocated corporate\nexpenses that do not directly support the\noperations of the business segments or for\nwhich the business segments are not considered\nfinancially accountable in evaluating their\nperformance, such as certain restructuring\ncharges, as well as residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in the United\nKingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) and Canada.\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n                                              \n  4    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our customers typically include\ncompanies with annual revenues between $20\nmillion and $2 billion.\n                                              \n   Business Developments                      \n                                              \nWe regularly explore and evaluate\nopportunities to acquire financial products\nand services as well as financial assets,\nincluding credit card and other loan\nportfolios, and enter into strategic\npartnerships as part of our growth strategy.\nWe also explore opportunities to acquire\ntechnology companies and related assets to\nimprove our information technology\ninfrastructure and to deliver on our digital\nstrategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund\nour acquisitions. In addition, we regularly\nconsider the potential disposition of certain\nof our assets, branches, partnership\nagreements or lines of business.\n                                              \n  5    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                           \n  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  \n                           \nThe following table presents selected\nconsolidated financial data and performance\nfrom our results of operations for the third\nquarter and first nine months of 2023 and 2022\nand selected comparative balance sheet data as\nof September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nWe also provide selected key metrics we use in\nevaluating our performance, including certain\nmetrics that are computed using non-GAAP\nmeasures. We consider these metrics to be key\nfinancial measures that management uses in\nassessing our operating performance, capital\nadequacy and the level of returns generated.\nWe believe these non-GAAP metrics provide\nuseful insight to investors and users of our\nfinancial information as they provide an\nalternate measurement of our performance and\nassist in assessing our capital adequacy and\nthe level of return generated. These non-GAAP\nmeasures should not be viewed as a substitute\nfor reported results determined in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles\nin the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), nor are they\nnecessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures\nthat may be presented by other companies.\n                                              \n   Table 1: Consolidated Financial            \n

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at\nthe consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments,\nare included in the Other category.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenues and expenses directly\nor indirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process is managed by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and provides a funds\ncredit for sources of funds, such as deposits\ngenerated by our Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking businesses, and a charge\nfor the use of funds by each segment. The\nallocation is unique to each business segment\nand acquired business and is based on the\ncomposition of assets and liabilities. The\nfunds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and\noff-balance sheet products. Periodically, the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the\nfunds transfer pricing process are adjusted to\nreflect economic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the business segments. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.

There is no comprehensive\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore,\nthe managed presentation of our business\nsegment results may not be comparable to\nsimilar information provided by other\nfinancial services companies.

We provide a summary of our\nsignificant accounting policies under \u201cPart\nII\u2014Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\u2014Note 1\u2014Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d in our 2022\nForm 10-K.\n\nWe have identified the following accounting\nestimates as critical because they require\nsignificant judgments and assumptions about\nhighly complex and inherently uncertain\nmatters and the use of reasonably different\nestimates and assumptions could have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations\nor financial condition. Our critical\naccounting policies and estimates are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Loan loss reserves\n\n\u2022 Goodwill\n\n\u2022 Fair value\n\n\u2022 Customer rewards reserve\nWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates\nand judgments on an ongoing basis and update\nthem as necessary, based on changing\nconditions.\n                                              \n  28    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Goodwill                                    \n                                              \nWe perform our goodwill impairment test\nannually on October 1 at a reporting unit\nlevel. As of our last annual test and as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, we had four reporting\nunits: Credit Card, Auto, Other Consumer\nBanking and Commercial Banking. We are also\nrequired to test goodwill for impairment when\na triggering event occurs that indicates it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is below its carrying amount.\n\nThe results of the 2022 annual goodwill\nimpairment test for the Commercial Banking\nreporting unit indicated that the estimated\nfair value of the Commercial Banking reporting\nunit exceeded its carrying amount by 17%.\nOutside of our annual impairment testing\nprocess, we monitor our reporting units for\nany triggering events while also performing\nqualitative assessments of impairment\nindicators. During the third quarter, we\nconcluded there were no triggering events and\ncompleted our qualitative assessment of\nimpairment indicators, which included, among\nother things, an assessment of changes in\nmacroeconomic conditions, comparison of the\nactual results to those forecasted in the most\nrecent annual impairment test and performing\nsensitivity analysis on key assumptions.\nThough this qualitative assessment concluded\nthat it was more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of the Commercial Banking reporting unit\nremained in excess of the carrying value as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, the amount by which the\nestimated fair value exceeded its carrying\nvalue is estimated to have declined relative\nto the results of the 2022 annual impairment\ntest.

The level and\ncomposition of our capital may also be\ninfluenced by rating agency guidelines,\nsubsidiary capital requirements, business\nenvironment, conditions in the financial\nmarkets and assessments of potential future\nlosses due to adverse changes in our business\nand market environments.\n                                              \n  Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective     \n  Action                                      \n                                              \nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the\nregulatory capital requirements established by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d),\nrespectively (the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d).\nThe Basel III Capital Rules implement certain\ncapital requirements published by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel\nCommittee\u201d), along with certain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and\nother capital provisions.\n\nAs a bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nbut less than $700 billion and not exceeding\nany of the applicable risk-based thresholds,\nthe Company is a Category III institution\nunder the Basel III Capital Rules.\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III\ninstitution, is a Category III bank. Moreover,\nthe Bank, as an insured depository\ninstitution, is subject to prompt corrective\naction (\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations.\n                                              \n  Basel III and United States Capital Rules   \n                                              \nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer requirement and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement,\neach as described below. Our capital and\nleverage ratios are calculated based on the\nBasel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of\naccumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our regulatory capital as\npermitted for a Category III institution.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe \u201cG-SIB Surcharge.\u201d We are not a G-SIB\nbased on the most recent available data and\nthus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s final rule to implement the\nstress capital buffer requirement (the \u201cStress\nCapital Buffer Rule\u201d), the Company\u2019s\n\u201cstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer\u201d includes its stress capital buffer\nrequirement (as described below), any G-SIB\nSurcharge (which is not applicable to us) and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%) . Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC\nand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(\u201cFDIC\u201d), hereafter collectively referred to\nas the \u201cFederal Banking Agencies,\u201d set an\nearlier effective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is recalibrated every year based\non the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults. In particular, the Company\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement equals, subject to\na floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference\nbetween the Company\u2019s starting CET1 capital\nratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital\nratio under the severely adverse scenario of\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test\nplus (ii) the ratio of the Company\u2019s projected\nfour quarters of common stock dividends (for\nthe fourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the Company\u2019s\nprojected CET1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2022 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 was\n3.1% . Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum\ncapital requirements\n                                              \n  30    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nplus the standardized approach capital\nconservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and total capital ratios under the\nstress capital buffer framework were 7.6%,\n9.1% and 11.1%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2022 through September 30,\n2023 .\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2023 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is\n4.8%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 9.3%,\n10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2023 through September 30,\n2024.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Bank. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Bank continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, the Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%,\nrespectively.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain\nits capital ratios above the minimum capital\nrequirements plus the applicable capital\nconservation buffer requirements, it will face\nincreasingly strict automatic limitations on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively, the Company and the Bank\neach exceeded the minimum capital requirements\nand the capital conservation buffer\nrequirements applicable to them, and the\nCompany and the Bank were each \u201c well-\ncapitalized. \u201d The \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nstandards applicable to the Company are\nestablished in the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nregulations, and the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d\nstandards applicable to the Bank are\nestablished in the OCC\u2019s PCA capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading book. The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more. As of September 30, 2023, the Company\nand the Bank are subject to the Market Risk\nRule. See \u201cMarket Risk Profile\u201d below for\nadditional information.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (the \u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that\nprovides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the current expected credit losses\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) standard on their regulatory capital\n(the \u201cCECL Transition Election\u201d). We adopted\nthe CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as\nof January 1, 2020, and made the CECL\nTransition Election (for regulatory capital\npurposes) in the first quarter of 2020.\nTherefore, the applicable amounts presented in\nthis Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year. The\nfollowing table summarizes the capital impact\ndelay and phase in period on our regulatory\ncapital from years 2020 to 2025.\n                                              \n        Ca\u2026           P\u2026                      \n        Im\u2026           In                      \n        De\u2026           P\u2026                      \n        20\u2026    20\u2026    2\u2026    20\u2026    2\u2026    20\u2026  \n  \u201c\u2026    Ca\u2026                                   \n  1\u201d    im\u2026           2\u2026    50%    7\u2026    Fu\u2026  \n  C\u2026    de\u2026           P\u2026    Ph\u2026    P\u2026    Ph\u2026  \n  a\u2026     to           In     In    In     In  \n  i\u2026    20\u2026                                   \n        25%                                   \n        sc\u2026                                   \n        fa\u2026                                   \n         as                                   \n  C\u2026     an                                   \n  \u201c\u2026    ap\u2026                                   \n  2\u201d     of                                   \n  o\u2026    the                                   \n  i\u2026    in\u2026                                   \n         in                                   \n        al\u2026                                   \n        un\u2026                                   \n        CE\u2026                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  31    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we added back an\naggregate amount of $2.4 billion to our\nregulatory capital pursuant to the CECL\nTransition Rule.

As\na BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely\ndependent upon the receipt of dividends or\nother payments from our subsidiaries.

The\ntiming and exact amount of any future common\nstock repurchases will depend on various\nfactors, including regulatory approval, market\nconditions, opportunities for growth, our\ncapital position and the amount of retained\nearnings. The Board authorized stock\nrepurchase program does not include specific\nprice targets, may be executed through open\nmarket purchases, tender offers, or privately\nnegotiated transactions, including utilizing\nRule 10b5-1 programs, does not have a set\nexpiration date and may be suspended at any\ntime.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022.\n                                              \n  Table 21: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of           September         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     30, 2023         31, 2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             69  %            69  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or              31               31     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n                                              \n  39    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of           September         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     30, 2023         31, 2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             52  %            53  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660           20               20     \n  620 or              28               27     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

Interest income\nforegone related to nonperforming loans was\n$91 million and $59 million in the first nine\nmonths of 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nForegone interest income represents the amount\nof interest income in excess of recognized\ninterest income that would have been recorded\nduring the period for nonperforming loans as\nof the end of the period had the loans\nperformed according to their contractual\nterms.\n\n(2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated\nbased on nonperforming loans for each category\ndivided by period-end total loans held for\ninvestment for each respective category.\n\n(3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit\ncard loans, nonperforming loans as a\npercentage of total loans held for investment\nwas 0.87% and 0.74% as of September 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n(4) The denominators used in calculating\nnonperforming asset rates consist of total\nloans held for investment and other\nnonperforming assets.\n                                              \n  43    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Net Charge-Offs                             \n                                              \nNet charge-offs consist of the amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, of loans\nheld for investment that we determine to be\nuncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We\ncharge off loans as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses when we determine\nthe loan is uncollectible and record\nsubsequent recoveries of previously charged\noff amounts as increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Uncollectible finance charges\nand fees are reversed through revenue and\ncertain fraud losses are recorded in other\nnon-interest expense. Generally, costs to\nrecover charged off loans are recorded as\ncollection expenses as incurred and are\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense. Our charge-off policy for loans\nvaries based on the loan type. See \u201cPart\nII\u2014Item 8.

The\nASU eliminates the accounting guidance for\nTDRs and establishes disclosure requirements\nfor certain loan refinancing and\nrestructurings for borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, which results in a more\nthan insignificant impact to the timing or\namount of contractual cash flows.\n\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a\nmodification was deemed a TDR when the\ncontractual terms of a loan agreement were\nmodified by granting a concession to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty.\nASU 2022-02 eliminated the concession\nrequirement for modifications. After the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02, a financial\ndifficulty modification (\u201cFDM\u201d) occurs when a\nmodification in the form of principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reduction, an\nother-than-insignificant payment delay, a term\nextension or a combination of these\nmodifications is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty.\n\nThe types of modifications we offer to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nhave not changed as a result of the adoption\nof ASU 2022-02. As part of our loss mitigation\nefforts, we may provide short-term (one to\ntwelve months) or long-term (greater than\ntwelve months) modifications to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty to improve\nlong-term collectability of the loan and to\navoid the need for repossession or foreclosure\nof collateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications, including FDMs, when estimating\nthe credit quality of our loan portfolio and\nestablishing allowance levels. For our\nCommercial Banking customers, loan\nmodifications are also considered in the\nassignment of an internal risk rating.\n\nIn our Credit Card business, the majority of\nour FDMs receive an interest rate reduction\nand are placed on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months. The effective interest\nrate on the loan immediately prior to the loan\nmodification is used as the effective interest\nrate for purposes of measuring impairment\nusing the present value of expected cash\nflows. If the customer does not comply with\nthe modified payment terms, then the credit\ncard loan agreement may revert to its original\npayment terms, generally resulting in any loan\noutstanding being reflected in the appropriate\ndelinquency category and charged off in\naccordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our FDMs receive an extension, an interest\nrate reduction, principal reduction, or a\ncombination of these modifications. Impairment\nis determined using the present value of\nexpected cash flows or a collateral evaluation\nfor certain auto loans where the collateral\nvalue is lower than the amortized cost.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of our FDMs receive an extension. A\nportion of FDMs receive an interest rate\nreduction, principal reduction, or a\ncombination of modifications.\n\nFor additional information on accounting\nstandards adopted during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u2014Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.\u201d For more information on FDMs in the\nthird quarter of 2023 and TDRs in the third\nquarter of 2022, see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance.

In\naddition to deposits, we raise funding through\nthe issuance of senior and subordinated notes\nand securitized debt obligations, federal\nfunds purchased, securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase and FHLB\nadvances secured by certain portions of our\nloan and securities portfolios.

We are exposed to\nmarket risk primarily from the following\noperations and activities:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of deposit\ngathering and lending;\n\n\u2022 Asset/liability management activities\nincluding the management of investment\nsecurities, short-term and long-term\nborrowings and derivatives;\n\n\u2022 Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada\nwithin our Credit Card business; and\n\n\u2022 Customer accommodation activities within our\nCommercial Banking business.\n\nWe have enterprise-wide risk management\npolicies and limits, approved by our Board of\nDirectors, which govern our market risk\nmanagement activities. Our objective is to\nmanage our exposure to market risk in\naccordance with these policies and limits\nbased on prevailing market conditions and\nlong-term expectations. We provide additional\ninformation below about our primary sources of\nmarket risk, our market risk management\nstrategies and the measures that we use to\nevaluate these exposures.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Risk                          \n                                              \nInterest rate risk represents exposure to\nfinancial instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest rates. We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or repricing of assets and\nliabilities. Our balance sheet is structurally\nasset sensitive as our loans, which are\nprimarily floating rate or fixed rate with\nshort durations, reprice faster than our fixed\nrate debt and a portion of our deposits when\ninterest rates change. We take actions to\n                                              \n  52    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nreduce the interest rate risk from this\nstructural balance sheet position primarily by\ninvesting in fixed rate securities in our\ninvestment portfolio and executing interest\nrate swaps and other derivative instruments.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact on our projected 12-month\nbaseline net interest income resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. In addition to\nour existing assets and liabilities, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions, such as loan and deposit growth\nand pricing, and plans for projected changes\nin our funding mix in our baseline forecast.\nWe also incorporate the dynamic nature of\ndeposit repricing, which includes pricing lags\nand changes in deposit beta and mix as\ninterest rates change, and the prepayment\nsensitivity of our mortgage securities to the\nlevel of interest rates. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\nprojected net interest income, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n32 below. At the current level of interest\nrates, our net interest income is expected to\nincrease in higher rate scenarios and decrease\nin lower rate scenarios. Our current\nsensitivity to both upward and downward shocks\nis largely unchanged as compared to December\n31, 2022, as the increase in cash balances was\noffset by an increase in deposit beta, which\nwas driven by higher interest rates and mix\nshift toward higher rate paid deposit\nproducts. Cash balances reprice relatively\nrapidly, whereas deposit rates reprice less\nwith both lag and beta effects. In the\ncontexts used in this section, \u201cbeta\u201d refers\nto the percentage of deposit rate repricing\nrelative to an external reference rate such as\nfederal funds. In our models, deposit betas\nvary dynamically and by product type.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity        \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact on the net\npresent value of our assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivative exposures, resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Similar to\nour net interest income sensitivity measure,\nwe incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit\nrepricing and attrition, which includes\npricing lags and changes in deposit beta as\ninterest rates change and the prepayment\nsensitivity of our mortgage securities to the\nlevel of interest rates. Other key assumptions\nused in the calculation include attrition\nassumptions for loans and other assets, term\nstructure modeling of interest rates and\ndiscount spreads. In measuring the sensitivity\nof interest rate movements on our economic\nvalue of equity, we assume a hypothetical\ninstantaneous parallel shift in the level of\ninterest rates detailed in Table 32 below. Our\ncurrent economic value of equity sensitivity\nprofile demonstrates that our economic value\nof equity decreases in higher interest rate\nscenarios and increases in lower interest rate\nscenarios. The decrease in higher rate\nscenarios is due to the declines in the\nprojected value of our fixed rate assets being\nonly partially offset by corresponding\nmovements in the projected value of our\ndeposits and other liabilities. The pace of\neconomic value of equity decrease is larger\nfor the +200 bps scenario as our deposits are\nassumed to reprice more rapidly in higher\ninterest rate environments. Our current\neconomic value of equity sensitivity increased\nas compared to December 31, 2022, primarily\ndue to an increase in deposit beta driven by\nhigher interest rates and mix shift towards\nhigher rate paid deposit products.\n                                              \n  53    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 32 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand our current economic value of equity\ncalculated under the methodology described\nabove as of September 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022.

We also regularly review the\nsensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics\nto changes in our key modeling assumptions,\nsuch as our loan and deposit balance\nforecasts, mortgage prepayments and deposit\nrepricing.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments. Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on our existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.

We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nnominal intercompany funding outstanding was\n902 million GBP and 785 million GBP as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively, and 1.7 billion CAD as of both\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Our\nnominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding\nwere 1.3 billion EUR as of both September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet to\ntranslation risk in AOCI and our capital\nratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 2.2 billion\nGBP and 1.9 billion GBP as of September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and\n2.4 billion CAD and 2.2 billion CAD as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal.

The proposal would also replace\nthe existing approach for market risk with a\nnew approach based on both internal models and\nstandardized methodologies. An institution\nsubject to the proposal would be required to\ncalculate its risk-weighted assets under both\nthe Expanded Risk-Based Approach and the\nexisting Basel III standardized approach and,\nfor each risk-based capital ratio, would be\nbound by the calculation that produces the\nlower ratio. All capital buffer requirements,\nincluding the stress capital buffer\nrequirement, would apply regardless of whether\nthe Expanded Risk-Based Approach or the\nexisting Basel III standardized approach\nproduces the lower ratio.\n                                              \n  55    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would also\nmake certain changes to the calculation of\nregulatory capital for Category III and IV\ninstitutions. Under the proposal, these\ninstitutions would be required to begin\nrecognizing certain elements of AOCI in CET1\ncapital, including unrealized gains and losses\non available for sale securities. The proposal\nwould also generally reduce the threshold\nabove which these institutions must deduct\ncertain assets from their CET1 capital,\nincluding certain deferred tax assets,\nmortgage servicing assets and investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal includes a\nproposed effective date of July 1, 2025,\nsubject to a three-year transition period\nending July 1, 2028, over which risk-weighted\nassets calculated under the Expanded Risk-\nBased Approach and the recognition of AOCI in\nCET1 capital would be phased in.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Other\nRelated Requirements Update\n\nLong-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company\nRequirements\nOn August 29, 2023, the Federal Banking\nAgencies proposed a rule that would require\nbanking organizations with $100 billion or\nmore in total assets, including the Company,\nto comply with certain long-term debt\nrequirements and clean holding company\nrequirements (the \u201cLTD Proposal\u201d).\n\nIf adopted as proposed, the LTD Proposal would\nrequire the Company and the Bank to each\nmaintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-\nterm debt amount of no less than the greatest\nof (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii)\n2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5%\nof average total consolidated assets. To\nqualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt\ninstrument would be required to meet the\nrequirements currently applicable under the\nrules that apply to U.S. G-SIBs, as well as\ncertain additional requirements. Additionally,\nthe clean holding company requirements\nincluded in the LTD Proposal would limit or\nprohibit the Company from entering into\ncertain transactions that could impede its\norderly resolution.\n\nWe are in the process of evaluating the LTD\nProposal and assessing its potential impact on\nCapital One, if adopted as proposed.\n\nWe provide additional information on our\nSupervision and Regulation in our 2022 Form\n10-K under \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d and in\nour Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nperiod ended June 30, 2023 under \u201cPart I\u2014Item\n2.

               \nThe Company\nCapital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware\ncorporation established in 1994 and\nheadquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cCapital One\u201d)\noffer a broad array of financial products and\nservices to consumers, small businesses and\ncommercial clients through digital channels,\nbranch locations, caf\u00e9s and other distribution\nchannels.\nAs of September 30, 2023, Capital One\nFinancial Corporation\u2019s principal subsidiary\nwas Capital One, National Association\n(\u201cCONA\u201d). On October 1, 2022, the Company\ncompleted the merger of Capital One Bank\n(USA), National Association (\u201cCOBNA\u201d), with\nand into CONA, with CONA as the surviving\nentity (the \u201cBank Merger\u201d).\nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d References to the\n\u201cBank\u201d shall mean and refer to (i) CONA from\nand after the Bank Merger and (ii) CONA and\nCOBNA collectively prior to the Bank Merger.\nWe also offer products outside of the United\nStates of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) principally through\nCapital One (Europe) plc (\u201cCOEP\u201d), an indirect\nsubsidiary of CONA organized and located in\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), and through a\nbranch of CONA in Canada. Both COEP and our\nCanadian branch of CONA have the authority to\nprovide credit card loans.\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into threemajor\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We\nprovide details on our business segments, the\nintegration of recent acquisitions, if any,\ninto our business segments and the allocation\nmethodologies and accounting policies used to\nderive our business segment results in \u201cNote\n12\u2014Business Segments and Revenue from\nContracts with Customers.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the U.S. (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d). The preparation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements in conformity with U.S.\nGAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin the consolidated financial statements and\nin the related disclosures. These estimates\nare based on information available as of the\ndate of the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile management makes its best judgments,\nactual amounts or results could differ from\nthese estimates. In the opinion of management,\nall normal, recurring adjustments have been\nincluded for a fair statement of this interim\nfinancial information.\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with\nthe audited consolidated financial statements,\nand related notes thereto, included in Capital\nOne Financial Corporation\u2019s 2022 Annual Report\non Form 10-K (\u201c2022 Form 10-K\u201d).\nLoan Modifications and Restructurings\nWe adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments\n- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures on\nJanuary 1, 2023, and elected the modified\nretrospective adoption method. The ASU\neliminates the accounting guidance for\ntroubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and\nresulted in a cumulative adjustment to\nretained earnings and our allowance, which was\nnot considered material. Subsequent to\nadoption, our consideration of modifications\nin measurement of the allowance for credit\nlosses remains substantively unchanged. The\nASU also establishes prospective disclosure\nrequirements for certain loan refinancings and\nrestructurings for borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty and current-period gross\ncharge-offs by year of origination for\nfinancing receivables and net investments in\nleases. We provide information on modified\nloans, including the performance of those\nloans subsequent to modification in \u201cNote\n3\u2014Loans\u201d and gross charge-offs by year of\norigination in \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments.\u201d\n                                              \n  75    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide modifications to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty to improve\nlong-term collectability of the loan and to\navoid the need for foreclosure or repossession\nof collateral, if any. Loan modifications to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty in\nthe form of principal forgiveness, interest\nrate reduction, an other-than-insignificant\ndelay in payment, including payment deferrals,\na term extension, or a combination of these\nmodifications are reported as a financial\ndifficulty modification (\u201cFDM\u201d). As\nrestructurings offered to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty are\ntypically not at market terms, FDMs are\ngenerally accounted for as a continuation of\nthe existing loan. See \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for\nadditional information on our loan\nmodifications and restructurings.\nLoan Modifications and Restructurings Prior to\nAdoption of ASU 2022-02\nIn periods prior to 2023, a loan modification\nin which a concession is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty was\naccounted for and reported as a TDR. These\nloan modifications typically include short-\nterm payment deferrals, an extension of the\nloan term, a reduction in the interest rate, a\nreduction in the loan balance, or a\ncombination of these modifications.

We discuss these\nrisks and our credit quality indicator for\neach portfolio segment below.\n\nCredit Card\n\nOur credit card loan portfolio is highly\ndiversified across millions of accounts and\nnumerous geographies without significant\nindividual exposure. We therefore generally\nmanage credit risk based on portfolios with\ncommon risk characteristics. The risk in our\ncredit card loan portfolio correlates to broad\neconomic trends, such as unemployment rates\nand the U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product\n(\u201cGDP\u201d) Rate, as well as consumers\u2019 financial\ncondition, all of which can have a material\neffect on credit performance. The key\nindicator we assess in monitoring the credit\nquality and risk of our credit card loan\nportfolio is delinquency trends, including an\nanalysis of loan migration between delinquency\ncategories over time.\nThe table below presents our credit card\nportfolio by delinquency status as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nTable 3.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \nConsumer Banking\nOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists\nof auto and retail banking loans.

We present our\nauto loan portfolio by FICO scores at\norigination and our retail banking loan\nportfolio by delinquency status, which\nincludes all past due loans, both performing\nand nonperforming.\n                                              \n  82    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nTable 3.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by\nVintage Year\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Amounts represent period-end loans held\nfor investment in each credit score category.\nAuto credit scores generally represent average\nFair Isaac Corporation (\u201cFICO\u201d) scores\nobtained from three credit bureaus at the time\nof application and are not refreshed\nthereafter.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses. Generally, loans that are\ndesignated as criticized performing and\ncriticized nonperforming are reviewed\nquarterly by management to determine if they\nare appropriately classified/rated and whether\nany impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are\nalso generally reviewed, at least annually, to\ndetermine the appropriate risk rating. In\naddition, we evaluate the risk rating during\nthe renewal process of any loan or if a loan\nbecomes past due.\n\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022. The internal risk\nrating status includes all past due loans,\nboth performing and nonperforming. Certain\namounts as of December 31, 2022 have been\nreclassified between vintage years to reflect\nour revised methodology for loans impacted by\nLIBOR transition.\nTable 3.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by\nInternal Risk Ratings\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  84    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Criticized exposures correspond to the\n\u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d and\n\u201cDoubtful\u201d asset categories defined by bank\nregulatory authorities.\n                                              \n  85    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nFinancial Difficulty Modifications to\nBorrowers\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (one to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectability of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications when estimating the credit\nquality of our loan portfolio and establishing\nallowance levels.

The types of\nmodifications we offer borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty did not change as a\nresult of ASU 2022-02. Under this new\naccounting guidance, FDMs are accumulated and\nthe performance of each loan that received a\nFDM is reported on a rolling twelve month\nbasis. For the interim reporting period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, FDMs and the related\nborrower performance information pertain to\nFDMs which occurred in the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. Significant judgment is applied in\nour estimation of lifetime credit losses. When\ndeveloping an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Our estimate of\nexpected credit losses includes a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period of one year\nand then reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses at each relevant loss\ncomponent of the estimate. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

The ASU requires public\nentities to disclose current-period gross\ncharge-offs by year of origination for\nfinancing receivables and net investments in\nleases.\n\nWe charge off loans when we determine that the\nloan is uncollectible. The amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, is charged\noff as a reduction to the allowance for credit\nlosses in accordance with our accounting\npolicies. For more information, see \u201cNote\n1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\n\nExpected recoveries of amounts previously\ncharged off or expected to be charged off are\nrecognized within the allowance, with a\ncorresponding reduction to our provision for\ncredit losses.\n                                              \n  94    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe table below presents gross charge-offs for\nloans held for investment by vintage year\nduring the nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\nTable 4.2: Gross Charge-Offs by Vintage Year\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  95    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nCredit Card Partnership Loss Sharing\nArrangements\nWe have certain credit card partnership\nagreements that are presented within our\nconsolidated financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions in net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which provide a source of funding for\nus and enable us to transfer a certain portion\nof the economic risk of the loans or related\ndebt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet the maximum amount of any remaining\nfunding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nWe separately present information for\nconsolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026        5       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       10       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       15       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n                                              \n  97    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       19       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       10       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       29       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities of the VIE, which includes the\nseller\u2019s interest and repurchased notes held\nby other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.5billion of assets and $\n931million of liabilities as of September 30,\n2023, and $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n616million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2022.\n\n(4) Primarily consists of variable interests\nin companies that promote renewable energy\nsources and other equity method investments.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to government-\nsponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service\nthe transferred loans pursuant to the\nguidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an\ninvestor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and\nABS in our investment securities portfolio,\nwhich represent variable interests in the\nrespective securitization trusts from which\nthose securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either solely invest in securities\nissued by the VIE and were not involved in the\ndesign of the VIE or no transfers have\noccurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our\nmaximum exposure to loss as a result of our\ninvolvement with these VIEs is the carrying\nvalue of the MSRs and investment securities on\nour consolidated balance sheets as well as our\ncontractual obligations under loss sharing\narrangements. See \u201cNote 13\u2014Commitments,\nContingencies, Guarantees and Others\u201d for\ninformation about the loss sharing agreements,\n\u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d\nfor information related to our MSRs associated\nwith these securitizations and \u201cNote\n2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for more information\non the securities held in our investment\nsecurities portfolio. In addition, where we\nhave certain lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business with entities that\ncould be VIEs, we have also excluded these\nVIEs from the tables presented in this note.\nSee \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for additional information\nregarding our lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business.\n                                              \n  98    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents our continuing\ninvolvement in certain securitization-related\nVIEs as of September 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022.\nTable 5.2: Continuing Involvement in\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n                                              \n  (Doll\u2026                                      \n  in                                          \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  Septe\u2026                                      \n  30,           Credit                        \n  2023:           Card             Auto       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  held                                        \n  by        $   13,772         $  3,645       \n  third\u2026                                      \n  inves\u2026                                      \n  Recei\u2026                                      \n  in the        25,532            4,295       \n  trusts                                      \n  Cash                                        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  spread             0               20       \n  or                                          \n  reser\u2026                                      \n  accou\u2026                                      \n  Retai\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Servi\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  retai\u2026                                      \n  Decem\u2026                                      \n  31,                                         \n  2022:                                       \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  held                                        \n  by        $   12,976         $  3,997       \n  third\u2026                                      \n  inves\u2026                                      \n  Recei\u2026                                      \n  in the        24,367            4,682       \n  trusts                                      \n  Cash                                        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  spread             0               23       \n  or                                          \n  reser\u2026                                      \n  accou\u2026                                      \n  Retai\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Servi\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  retai\u2026                                      \n                                              \nCredit Card Securitizations\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card\nloans which provides a source of funding for\nus. Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritizations involve the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain investments in qualified\naffordable housing projects using the\nproportional amortization method if certain\ncriteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized\namortization of $ 522million and $ 484million,\nrespectively, and tax credits of $ 652million\nand $ 582million, respectively, associated\nwith these investments within income tax\nprovision. The carrying value of our equity\ninvestments in these qualified affordable\nhousing projects was $ 5.3billion and $\n4.9billion as of September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.

Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency swaps to hedge, but we may\nalso use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We offset the\nsubstantial majority of the market risk\nexposure of our customer accommodation\nderivatives through derivative transactions\nwith other counterparties.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the hedged forecasted\ntransactions impact earnings and presented in\nthe same line item in our consolidated\nstatements of income as the earnings effect of\nthe hedged items. Our cash flow hedges use\ninterest rate swaps and floors that are\nintended to hedge the variability in interest\nreceipts or interest payments on some of our\nvariable-rate financial assets or liabilities.\nWe also enter into foreign currency forward\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to variability\nin cash flows related to intercompany\nborrowings denominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  103    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that stems from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the\nIntercontinental Exchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH\nGroup (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs for our centrally\ncleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral\ncontracts, we enter into agreements directly\nwith our derivative counterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements, where applicable, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. We exchange collateral in\ntwo primary forms: variation margin, which\nmitigates the risk of changes in value due to\ndaily market movements and is exchanged daily,\nand initial margin, which mitigates the risk\nof potential future exposure of a derivative\nand is exchanged at the outset of a\ntransaction and adjusted daily. We exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin on our\ncleared derivatives. For uncleared bilateral\nderivatives executed after September 1, 2021\nand in scope for initial margin, we exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin.\n\nThe amount of collateral exchanged for\nvariation margin is dependent upon the fair\nvalue of the derivative instruments as well as\nthe fair value of the pledged collateral and\nwill vary over time as market variables\nchange. The amount of the initial margin\nexchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation\nof initial margin exposure, as prescribed by\n1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators\u2019 margin\nrules for uncleared derivatives (\u201cPR Rules\u201d)\nor 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and\n2) the fair value of the pledged collateral;\nit will vary over time as market variables\nchange. When valuing collateral, an estimate\nof the variation in price and liquidity over\ntime is subtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d\nto discount the value of the collateral\npledged. Our exposure to derivative\ncounterparty credit risk, at any point in\ntime, is equal to the amount reported as a\nderivative asset on our balance sheet. The\nfair value of our derivatives is adjusted on\nan aggregate basis to take into consideration\nthe effects of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and any associated\ncollateral received or pledged. See Table 8.3\nfor our net exposure associated with\nderivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. We also clear exchange-traded\ninstruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures\ncommission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the\nintermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require\nthat we post initial and variation margin\nthrough our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-\npayment or default. Initial margin is required\nby CCPs as collateral against potential losses\non our exchange-traded and cleared derivative\ncontracts and variation margin is exchanged on\na daily basis to account for mark-to-market\nchanges in those derivative contracts. For\nCME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives,\nvariation margin cash payments are required to\nbe characterized as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with bilateral derivative\ncounterparties, where applicable, to mitigate\nthe risk of default. These bilateral\nagreements typically provide the right to\noffset exposure with the same counterparty and\nrequire the party in a net liability position\nto post collateral. Agreements with certain\nbilateral counterparties require both parties\nto maintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of uncleared derivatives exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\n                                              \n  104    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty.

These amounts were\nlargely offset by the foreign currency\ntransaction gains (losses) on our foreign\ncurrency denominated intercompany funding\nincluded in other non-interest income on our\nconsolidated statements of income.\n\nIn the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify\ninto earnings an after-tax loss of $\n877million recorded in AOCI as of September\n30, 2023 associated with cash flow hedges of\nforecasted transactions. This amount will\nlargely offset the cash flows associated with\nthe forecasted transactions hedged by these\nderivatives. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted transactions were hedged was\napproximately 9.5years as of September 30,\n2023. The amount we expect to reclassify into\nearnings may change as a result of changes in\nmarket conditions and ongoing actions taken as\npart of our overall risk management strategy.\n

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n              observable in the market.       \n  Level\u00a03:    Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d)               \n              methodologies or similar        \n              techniques.                     \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nWe consider all available information,\nincluding observable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and\nsignificant inputs. Based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or\ninstrument category, judgments are made\nregarding the significance of the observable\nor unobservable inputs to the instruments\u2019\nfair value measurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. The\naccounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period. We consider all available\ninformation, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs.\nFor additional information on the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities on a\nrecurring basis, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u2014Note 16\u2014Fair Value Measurement\u201d in our\n2022 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  116    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following table displays our assets and\nliabilities measured on our consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of September 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022.\nTable 11.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $           0        $    \n                                0             \n                                0             \n                                0             \n                                0             \n                                0             \n                                              \n                           $                  \n                                0             \n      $      $      $      $             $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $             $    \n      $      $      $      $             $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $           0        $    \n                                0             \n                                0             \n                                0             \n                                0             \n                                0             \n                                              \n                           $                  \n                                0             \n      $      $      $      $             $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $             $    \n      $      $      $      $             $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents balance sheet netting of\nderivative assets and liabilities, and related\npayables and receivables for cash collateral\nheld or placed with the same counterparty.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity or\ncredit spreads, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. In\naddition, an increase in default rates would\ngenerally be accompanied by a decrease in\nrecovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an\nincrease in liquidity spreads, and would lead\nto a decrease in the fair value measurement.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasureme nts\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain.

to the nature of the various mortgage\nsecuritization structures in which we have\nretained interests, it is not meaningful to\npresent a consolidated weighted average for\nthe significant unobservable inputs.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe are required to measure and recognize\ncertain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThese assets are not measured at fair value on\nan ongoing basis but are subject to fair value\nadjustments in certain circumstances (for\nexample, from the application of lower of cost\nor fair value accounting or when we evaluate\nfor impairment).\nThe following table presents the carrying\nvalue of the assets measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a segment, such as management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio,\nasset/liability management by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and residual tax\nexpense or benefit to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate that is not\nassessed to our primary business segments, are\nincluded in the Other category.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenues and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess managed by our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation is unique to\neach business segment and acquired business\nand is based on the composition of assets and\nliabilities. The funds transfer pricing\nprocess considers the interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics of assets and\nliabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically the methodology and assumptions\nutilized in the funds transfer pricing process\nare adjusted to reflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the\nbusiness segments. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate market rate. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

The contractual\namount of these commitments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to us should the\ncounterparty draw upon the commitment. We\ngenerally manage the potential risk of\nunfunded lending commitments by limiting the\ntotal amount of arrangements, monitoring the\nsize and maturity structure of these\nportfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of September 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022. The carrying value\nrepresents our reserve and deferred revenue on\nlegally binding commitments.\nTable 13.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments\n                                              \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n  \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026          N\u2026          N\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Includes $ 5.1billion and $ 4.4billion of\nadvised lines of credit as of September 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n(2) These financial guarantees have expiration\ndates that range from 2024 to 2027 as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nLoss Sharing Agreements\nWithin our Commercial Banking business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans with the intent to sell them to the\nGSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of these\noriginated loans. Beginning January 1, 2020,\nwe elected the fair value option on new loss\nsharing agreements entered into. Unrealized\ngains and losses are recorded in other non-\ninterest income in our consolidated statements\nof income. For those loss sharing agreements\nentered into as of and prior to December 31,\n2019, we amortize the liability recorded at\ninception into non-interest income as we are\nreleased from risk of having to make a payment\nand record our estimate of expected credit\nlosses each period through the provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income. The liability recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheets for these loss\nsharing agreements was $ 117million and $\n82million as of September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. See \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for information\nrelated to our credit card partnership loss\nsharing arrangements.\n                                              \n  128    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nLitigation\n\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for litigation-related matters that\narise from the ordinary course of our business\nactivities when it is probable that a loss\nassociated with a claim or proceeding has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 are approximately $\n200million. Our reserve and reasonably\npossible loss estimates involve considerable\njudgment and reflect that there is still\nsignificant uncertainty regarding numerous\nfactors that may impact the ultimate loss\nlevels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlitigation matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and the range of reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed here. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in these matters,\nespecially those involving governmental\nagencies, and the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these matters, there\nis significant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these litigation\nmatters and an adverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be material to our\nresults of operations or cash flows for any\nparticular reporting period.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds settlements for its member\nbanks, and any settlements related to\nMasterCard-allocated losses have either\nalready been paid or are reflected in our\nreserves.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we\nhave been subject to numerous legal\nproceedings and other inquiries and could be\nthe subject of additional proceedings and\ninquiries in the future.\n\nConsumer class actions . We are named as a\ndefendant in 5putative consumer class action\ncases in Canadian courts alleging harm from\nthe Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various\nremedies, including monetary and injunctive\nrelief. The lawsuits allege breach of\ncontract, negligence, violations of various\nprivacy laws and a variety of other legal\ncauses of action. In the second quarter of\n2022, a trial court in British Columbia\npreliminarily certified a class of all\nimpacted Canadian consumers except those in\nQuebec, which would allow the case to proceed\nwith discovery on a classwide basis under\nCanadian law. The preliminary certification\ndecision in British Columbia has been\nappealed. In the third quarter of 2023, a\ntrial court in Quebec preliminarily authorized\na class of all impacted consumers in Quebec.\nThis decision also has been appealed.\nProceedings are continuing in parallel in\nOntario and Alberta.\n                                              \n  129    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nGovernmental inquiries. In August 2020, we\nentered into consent orders with the Federal\nReserve and the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) resulting from regulatory\nreviews of the Cybersecurity Incident and\nrelating to ongoing enhancements of our\ncybersecurity and operational risk management\nprocesses. We paid an $ 80million penalty to\nthe U.S. Treasury as part of the OCC\nagreement. The Federal Reserve agreement did\nnot contain a monetary penalty. The OCC lifted\nits consent order on August 31, 2022 and the\nFederal Reserve lifted its consent order on\nJuly 5, 2023. Canada\u2019s Office of Privacy\nCommissioner\u2019s (\u201cOPC\u201d) investigation into the\nCybersecurity Incident is still open.\n\nWalmart Litigation\n\nOn April 7, 2023, Walmart filed a lawsuit in\nthe Southern District of New York seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment that it has the\ncontractual right to early termination of the\ncredit card partnership agreement under which\nwe are the exclusive issuer of Walmart\u2019s\nprivate label and co-branded credit card\nprogram in the U.S. and share in certain\nrelated economics. On May 2, 2023, Walmart\nfiled an amended complaint in which it also\nalleges breach of contract and seeks damages\ncaused by any delay in termination. On May 4,\n2023, we filed an Answer and Counterclaim to\nWalmart\u2019s amended complaint, denying that\nWalmart has any right to terminate the\npartnership and alleging that Walmart has\nbreached its contractual obligations to\nCapital One.\n\nU.K. PPI Litigation\n\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received\ncustomer complaints and regulatory claims\nrelating to PPI. COEP has materially resolved\nthe PPI complaints and regulatory claims\nreceived prior to the deadline. Some of the\nclaimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims\nprocess have subsequently initiated legal\nproceedings, seeking additional redress. We\nare responding to these proceedings as we\nreceive them.\n\nSavings Account Litigation\n\nIn July 2023, Capital One was sued in a\nputative class action in the Eastern District\nof Virginia by savings account holders\nalleging breach of contract and a variety of\nother causes of action relating to Capital\nOne\u2019s introduction of a new savings account\nproduct with a higher interest rate than\nexisting savings account products. Capital One\nintends to file its response to the lawsuit in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  130    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.
