Similarly, our Auto Finance\nbusiness posted solid top-lineoriginations and\nloan growth. We continued to expand our\nnational retail bank franchise with solid 6%\ndeposit growth, and our Commercial Banking\nbusiness outpaced the growth of the industry.\nSolid underwriting and strikingly strong\ncredit results drove improvement in customer\ncharge-offs and resulted in large releases\nfrom our reserve for expected credit losses.\nOperating expenses grew at a slower rate than\nrevenues, leading to an improvement in\noperating efficiency ratio (1)(2)by 213 basis\npoints to 45.0%. Operating efficiency ratio,\nnet of adjustments, improved by 133 basis\npoints to 44.7%. In addition, management\nstayed keenly focused on delivering\nshareholder value.

Our stock price\ngrowth significantly outperformed the largest\nbenchmark of our bank peers, the KBW Bank\nIndex, and our Total Shareholder Return\noutperformed the KBW Bank Index by 11\npercentage points. We achieved exceptional\n2021 financial performance while continuing to\ninvest in transformation, talent, growth, and\nour long-term technology capabilities. We\nearned a number of external awards and\naccolades related to our products and customer\nexperiences and continued to be recognized for\nour customer satisfaction and advocacy. Net\nPromoter Scores, which measure how likely a\ncustomer is to recommend our products and\nservices, reached record highs across a number\nof our major businesses. Despite increased\ninvestments in these areas, we began to\nharness the power of our migration to the\ncloud and realize cost benefits of our exits\nfrom data centers. We also strengthened our\nrisk and control environment and continued to\nenhance cybersecurity. We invested heavily in\nrecruiting, developing, and retaining talent\nand we welcomed thousands of new associates\nand have maintained strong associate morale\nand engagement despite ongoing stresses\nrelated to the pandemic.

Our Board is\npresenting the following thirteen nominees for\nelection as directors at the 2022 Annual\nStockholder Meeting. Each nominee is a current\nBoard member who was elected by stockholders\nat the 2021 Annual Stockholder Meeting, other\nthan Christine Detrick, who was appointed to\nthe Board effective November 5, 2021, and was\nrecommended to the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee by Spencer Stuart, a third-party\ndirector search firm. Each nominee has\nconsented to serve a one-yearterm. Information\nabout the proposed nominees for election as\ndirectors is set forth under \u0093Biographies of\nDirector Nominees\u0094 beginning on page 20 of\nthis proxy statement. In the event a nominee\nbecomes unable to serve or for good cause will\nnot serve as a director, the Board may\ndesignate a substitute as a nominee or reduce\nthe size of the Board. If the Board designates\na substitute nominee, proxies will be voted\nfor the election of such substitute. As of the\ndate of this proxy statement, the Board has no\nreason to believe that any of the nominees\nwill be unable or unwilling to serve as a\ndirector. The nominees for election as\ndirectors at the 2022 Annual Stockholder\nMeeting are:\n                                              \n                      D\u2026           O\u2026         \n

In fulfilling\nthis responsibility, the Governance and\nNominating Committee has taken a long-term\nview and continuously assesses the resiliency\nof the Board over the next ten to fifteen\nyears in alignment with the Company\u0092s\nstrategic direction to determine what actions\nmay be desirable to best position the Board\nand the Company for success. In assessing\nBoard resiliency, the Governance and\nNominating Committee considers a variety of\nfactors, including the Company\u0092s long-term\nstrategy, the skills and experiences that\ndirectors provide to the Board (including in\nthe context of the Company\u0092s strategy), the\nperformance of the Board and the Company, the\nBoard\u0092s director retirement policy (as\ndescribed in the Company\u0092s Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines), the Board\u0092s view that\na resilient board should include members\nacross a continuum of tenure, and the belief\nthat valuable insights can be gained from\ndiversity among the Board\u0092s members across\ngender and race/ethnicity.

In its review,\nthe Governance and Nominating Committee\nconsiders whether the Board continues to\npossess the appropriate mix of skills and\nexperience to oversee the Company in achieving\nthese goals, and may seek additional directors\nas a result of this review. Our director\nnominees have the requisite experiences that,\nin the aggregate, meet an articulated set of\ndirector skills established by the Governance\nand Nominating Committee.

Committee deems\nappropriate. In 2021, Capital One continued\nits engagement with Spencer Stuart, a third-\nparty director search firm to identify and\nevaluate potential director candidates based\non the criteria and principles described\nabove. When evaluating incumbent directors,\nthe Governance and Nominating Committee also\nconsiders the director\u0092s performance\nthroughout the year, including the director\u0092s\nattendance, preparation for, and participation\nin Board and committee meetings, the\ndirector\u0092s annual evaluation, feedback\nreceived from fellow Board members, and the\ndirector\u0092s willingness to serve for an\nadditional term, as further described in the\nsection \u0093Annual Assessment of Individual\nDirector Nominees\u0094 on page 30. Process for\nStockholder Recommendations of Director\nCandidates Stockholders may propose nominees\nfor consideration by the Governance and\nNominating Committee by submitting the names\nand other relevant information as required by,\nand in compliance with, Capital One\u0092s Bylaws,\nand further described in Capital One\u0092s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, to the\nCorporate Secretary at Capital One\u0092s address\nset forth in the section \u0093How to Contact Us\u0094\non page 51. Capital One\u0092s Corporate Governance\nGuidelines require the Corporate Secretary to\ndeliver a copy of the submitted information to\nthe Chair of the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee. The Governance and Nominating\nCommittee will consider potential nominees\nproposed by stockholders on the same basis as\nit considers other potential nominees. In\naddition, an eligible stockholder or group of\nstockholders may use Capital One\u0092s \u0093proxy\naccess\u0094 bylaws to include stockholder-\nnominated director candidates in the Company\u0092s\nproxy materials for annual meetings of\nstockholders. Our Bylaws permit up to 20\nstockholders owning 3% or more of the\nCompany\u0092s outstanding common shares of voting\nstock continuously for at least three years to\nnominate and include in the Company\u0092s proxy\nmaterials director nominees constituting up to\ntwo individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever\nis greater) provided that the stockholder(s)\nand the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements\nspecified in the Bylaws. Director Independence\nExcept for our CEO, who is the Company\u0092s\nfounder, the Board has affirmatively\ndetermined that the other members of our Board\nare independent under Capital One\u0092s Director\nIndependence Standards (the \u0093Independence\nStandards\u0094), which have been adopted by the\nBoard as part of Capital One\u0092s Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines. The Independence\nStandards reflect the director independence\nrequirements set forth in the listing\nstandards of the New York Stock Exchange\n(\u0093NYSE\u0094) and other applicable legal and\nregulatory rules, and also describe certain\ncategorical relationships that the Board has\ndetermined to be immaterial for purposes of\ndetermining director independence. The\ncategorical relationships the Board has deemed\nimmaterial for purposes of determining\ndirector independence are: (i) relationships\nbetween Capital One and an entity where the\ndirector serves solely as a non-\nmanagementdirector; (ii) transactions between\nCapital One and a director or a director\u0092s\nimmediate family (or their primary business\naffiliations) that fall below the numerical\nthresholds in the NYSE listing standards (or\ndo not otherwise preclude independence under\nthose standards), and that are ordinary\ncourse, on arm\u0092s-lengthmarket terms, and, in\nthe case of extensions of credit, followed\nusual underwriting procedures, present no more\nthan the normal collectability risk or other\nunfavorable features and are in compliance\nwith applicable legal and regulatory\nrequirements; and (iii) discretionary\ncontributions made by Capital One to not-for-\nprofitorganizations, foundations, or\nuniversities in which a director (or immediate\nfamily member) serves as an executive officer\nthat in any single fiscal year within the last\nthree years do not exceed the greater of $1\nmillion or 2% of that entity\u0092s consolidated\ngross revenues.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  18    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nIn making its independence recommendations,\nthe Governance and Nominating Committee and\nthe Board evaluate information obtained from\nnon-managementdirectors\u0092 responses to a\nquestionnaire inquiring about their\nrelationships with Capital One, and those of\ntheir immediate family members and primary\nbusiness or charitable affiliations and other\npotential conflicts of interest, as well as\ncertain information related to transactions,\nrelationships, or arrangements between Capital\nOne and a non-managementdirector or their\nimmediate family members, primary business, or\ncharitable affiliations.

As part of this\nonboarding program, over a period of\napproximately 18 months, new directors meet\nwith members of senior management serving in\nvarious roles and functions, as well as Board\ncommittee chairs, the Lead Independent\nDirector, and individual directors, to review\nand discuss information about the Company, the\nbusiness, the boardroom, and individual\ndirector roles and responsibilities.\nAdditionally, new directors are assigned an\nexperienced director to serve as a mentor to\nfacilitate their onboarding to the Board and\nthe Company. Our continuing director education\nprogram is designed to provide: (i) regular\nupdates on external opportunities for\ncontinuing education offered by applicable\nregulators, professional organizations, and\nacademic institutions; (ii) internal director\neducation programs; (iii) various board-\nrelated publications; and (iv) access to peer-\nto-peernetworks. Our directors are also\nencouraged to pursue other educational\nopportunities, at the Company\u0092s expense, to\nenhance directors\u0092 ability to perform their\nduties. Executive Sessions Our Independent\nDirectors regularly convene executive sessions\nled by the Lead Independent Director at Board\nand committee meetings as needed. The\nexecutive sessions allow the Independent\nDirectors to discuss strategy, CEO and senior\nmanagement performance and compensation,\nsuccession planning, Board effectiveness, and\nother matters without management present. In\n2021, the Independent Directors met 13 times\nin executive session. During these executive\nsessions, Directors have access to all the\nmembers of senior management as they may\nrequest, such as the CEO, CFO, Corporate\nSecretary, General Counsel, Chief Risk\nOfficer, Chief Audit Officer, Chief\nInformation Security Officer, Chief Technology\nRisk Officer, Chief Credit Review Officer, and\nChief Compliance Officer. The Lead Independent\nDirector and/or any director may request\nadditional executive sessions of Independent\nDirectors.

Furthermore, the Board and\nits committees periodically may further assess\ntheir effectiveness outside of the annual\nself-evaluation process. The Board believes\nthat in addition to serving as a tool to\nevaluate and improve performance, evaluations\ncan serve several other purposes, including\nthe promotion of good governance and the\nintegrity of financial reporting, reduction of\nrisk, informing the Board refreshment process,\nstrengthening the Board-management\npartnership, and helping set and oversee Board\nexpectations of management. In assessing their\nperformance, the Board and its committees take\na multi-year perspective to identify and\nevaluate trends and assure themselves that\nareas identified for improvement are\nappropriately and timely addressed. To ensure\nthe process stays fresh and continues to\ngenerate rich insights, the Board follows a\ncyclical, programmatic approach when\nconducting Board and committee evaluations.\nThis approach includes regular, holistic\nreviews of the evaluation framework,\nmethodology, and form. While the Board and\neach of its committees conducts a formal\nevaluation annually, the Board considers its\nperformance and that of its committees\ncontinuously throughout the year and shares\nfeedback with management.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            29  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nAs part of the Board\u0092s self-evaluation\nprocess, directors consider various topics\nrelated to Board composition, effectiveness,\nstructure, and performance and the overall mix\nof director skills, experience, and\nbackground.

Each year the Governance\nand Nominating Committee designates one\nIndependent Director as a facilitator, who\nsolicits feedback and perspectives from all\ndirectors on the Lead Independent Director.\nThe facilitator then shares the results with\nthe Governance and Nominating Committee and,\nas appropriate, the Board, without the Lead\nIndependent Director present. The Independent\nDirectors consider the results of this\nassessment in the annual selection of the Lead\nIndependent Director. Our Lead Independent\nDirector is currently Ms. Hackett. As Lead\nIndependent Director, Ms. Hackett has a strong\nrecord of active engagement both inside and\noutside the boardroom, including regular\nmeetings with federal regulators and company\nexecutives in one-on-oneand group settings.\nMs. Hackett is also an active member of\nTapestry Networks\u0092 Lead Director Network, a\nselect group of lead independent directors\nfrom America\u0092s most successful companies who\nshare a commitment to improving corporate\nperformance and earning stockholder trust\nthrough more effective board leadership.\nLeveraging her significant experience serving\nin leadership capacities in a variety of\nenvironments, Ms. Hackett has fostered a\nculture of collaboration, diligence, trust,\nand mutual respect that allows the Board to\nwork effectively to provide oversight of and\neffective challenge to management. Based on\nher performance, the Independent Directors\nunanimously supported Ms. Hackett\u0092s re-\nelectionas Lead Independent Director for a\none-yearterm beginning May 2021. Annual\nPerformance Assessment of the CEO Led by the\nLead Independent Director, the Independent\nDirectors annually assess the performance of\nMr. Fairbank as Capital One\u0092s CEO through a\nprocess developed and overseen by the\nGovernance and Nominating Committee. This\nprocess includes an in-depthdiscussion of the\nCEO\u0092s performance by the Independent Directors\nin executive session during which directors\nconsider a variety of factors. For example,\ncultural values and ethical conduct are\ncritical factors in both selecting and\nevaluating the CEO, and therefore, the\nIndependent Directors specifically consider\nthe CEO\u0092s efforts in establishing and\nmaintaining Capital One\u0092s culture, brand, and\nreputation, with a strategic focus on products\nand services to build an enduring customer\nfranchise and on embedding Capital One\u0092s\nculture throughout the organization. The\nIndependent Directors also consider feedback\nfrom the Board and self-assessment materials\nprovided by Mr. Fairbank regarding his and the\nCompany\u0092s performance and achievements of\nvarious subjective and objective metrics. For\nadditional information, see \u0093Chief Executive\nOfficer Compensation\u0094 beginning on page 70.\nThe annual CEO performance assessment is\ncompleted as part of the year-endcompensation\nprocess. The Compensation Committee manages\nyear-endcompensation decisions within the\ncontext of such assessment, and the Lead\nIndependent Director and Chair of the\nCompensation Committee jointly share the\nfeedback of the CEO performance assessment\nwith Mr. Fairbank in a closed session. The\nBoard\u0092s Role in Corporate Oversight Our Board\nis accountable for oversight of Capital One\u0092s\nbusiness affairs and operations. In carrying\nout this responsibility, among other things,\nthe Board oversees management\u0092s development\nand implementation of the Company\u0092s (i)\ncorporate culture; (ii) corporate strategy;\n(iii) financial performance and associated\nrisks; (iv) the enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement framework, including cybersecurity\nrisk; (v) succession planning for the\nCompany\u0092s CEO and other key executives; and\n(vi) policies, programs, and strategies\nrelated to environmental, social, and\ngovernance matters.

As the COVID-19pandemic\ndeveloped, a cross-functional team of Company\nmanagement was assembled to continuously\nmonitor the impact of the COVID-19pandemic on\nour business and implement necessary measures\nto appropriately manage risk. The Board has\nreceived frequent updates on the pandemic\u0092s\nimpact on market conditions and the Company\u0092s\nbusiness and associates, and reviewed with\nmanagement the Company\u0092s risk mitigation\nstrategies and business contingency plans.\nSince mid-March2020, this Board oversight\nincluded both formal and informal Board\nmeetings and updates regarding the Company\u0092s\npandemic response.

Each\nyear, the full Board participates in an annual\nBoard Strategy Meeting that provides an\nopportunity for the Board to engage with the\nCEO and key senior leaders in assessing the\ncompetitive environment and Capital One\u0092s\nenterprise and divisional strategies, and to\nprovide effective challenge, feedback, and\ninput on the Company\u0092s long-term strategy and\ninvestments. Following the Board Strategy\nMeeting, the Chief Risk Officer meets with the\nfull Board to provide a risk assessment of\nCapital One\u0092s strategic imperatives.\nAfterwards, the Board reviews and approves the\nlong-term strategic plan. As the year\nprogresses, the Board remains engaged in\noverseeing the implementation and monitoring\nof Capital One\u0092s strategy through updates by\nthe CEO on enterprise corporate strategy and\nby Division Presidents on business line\nstrategies and results. These updates\ntypically include business line performance\nand outlook, external and competitive trends,\nkey investment opportunities, and risk\nevaluation and mitigation strategies. This\napproach allows the Board to engage in\ninformed discussions with management regarding\nfinancial performance and trajectory, capital\nallocation, strategy implementation, and risk-\nmitigation plans, where appropriate. Financial\nPerformance and Associated Risks The Board\noversees the Company\u0092s financial performance\nby reviewing with management, on a regular\nbasis, the Company\u0092s quarterly and annual\nfinancial statements. The Audit Committee\noversees the integrity of the Company\u0092s\nfinancial statements by, among other things,\nobtaining independent assurance as to the\ncompleteness and accuracy of its financial\nstatements from an independent registered\npublic accounting firm, whose qualifications,\nindependence, and performance it reviews on an\nannual basis. The Audit Committee also\noversees the integrity of the Company\u0092s\ninternal controls over financial reporting by,\namong other things, reviewing periodic\nassessments of the adequacy and effectiveness\nof the Company\u0092s financial controls performed\nby both the Company\u0092s independent registered\npublic accounting firm and internal audit\nfunction. In addition, the Board, either\ndirectly or through the Risk Committee, plays\nan integral role in the oversight of capital\nplanning and adequacy, funding and liquidity\nrisk management, market risk management,\ninvestment portfolio management, and other\nasset liability management matters. Risk\nOversight The Board believes that effective\nrisk management and control processes are\ncritical to Capital One\u0092s safety and\nsoundness, our ability to predict and manage\nthe challenges that Capital One and the\nfinancial services industry face, and,\nultimately, Capital One\u0092s long-term corporate\nsuccess. The enterprise-wide risk management\nframework defines the Board\u0092s appetite for\nrisk taking and enables senior management to\nunderstand, manage, and report on risk. The\nrisk management framework is implemented\nenterprise-wide and includes seven risk\ncategories: compliance, credit, liquidity,\nmarket, operational, reputation, and\nstrategic. Management has developed risk\nappetite statements with accompanying metrics\nwhich are meaningful to the organization and\nreflect the aggregate level and types of risk\nCapital One is willing to accept in order to\nachieve its business objectives, clarifying\nboth risks the Company is actively taking and\nrisks that are purposely avoided. The Risk\nCommittee is responsible for the oversight of\nenterprise-wide risk management for the\nCompany, and is responsible for reviewing and\nrecommending to the Board for approval certain\nrisk tolerances taking into account the\nCompany\u0092s structure, risk profile, complexity,\nactivities, size, and other appropriate risk-\nrelated factors. Within management,\nenterprise-wide risk management is generally\nthe responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer,\nwho has accountability for proposing risk\ntolerance and reporting levels related to all\nseven risk categories. The Chief Risk Officer\nis also responsible for ensuring that the\nCompany has an overall enterprise risk\nframework and that it routinely assesses and\nreports on enterprise level risks. The Chief\nRisk Officer reports both to the CEO and to\nthe Risk Committee. The Audit Committee also\nplays an important risk oversight function,\nand oversees elements of compliance. The\nCompensation Committee oversees compensation\npolicies and practices to ensure balanced\nrisk-taking as further described in \u0093Risk\nAssessment of Compensation Policies and\nPractices\u0094 beginning on page 34 below.\nFinally, the Board as a whole oversees the\nentire enterprise-wide risk framework for the\nCompany, including the oversight of strategic\nrisk.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            33  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nCybersecurity and Technology Risk As a\nfinancial services company entrusted with the\nsafeguarding of sensitive information, our\nBoard believes that a strong enterprise cyber\nprogram is vital to effective risk management.\nAs part of its program of regular oversight,\nthe Risk Committee of the Board is responsible\nfor overseeing cyber risk, information\nsecurity, and technology risk, including\nmanagement\u0092s actions to identify, assess,\nmitigate, and remediate material cyber issues\nand risks. The Risk Committee receives\nquarterly reports from the Chief Information\nSecurity Officer and Chief Technology Risk\nOfficer on the Company\u0092s technology and cyber\nrisk profile, enterprise cyber program, and\nkey enterprise cyber initiatives. In addition,\nthe Risk Committee discusses matters escalated\nto it by the Technology and Cyber Risk\nCommittee, a management-level committee\ndedicated to the discussion of enterprise-wide\ncybersecurity and technology risk issues whose\nresponsibilities include, among other things,\ndiscussion of cyber and technology risks. The\nRisk Committee coordinates with the full Board\nregarding the strategic implications of cyber\nand technology risks. The Chief Information\nOfficer, Chief Information Security Officer,\nand Chief Technology Risk Officer also follow\na risk-based escalation process to notify the\nRisk Committee outside of the quarterly\nreporting cycle when they identify an emerging\nrisk or material issue. The Risk Committee\nannually reviews and recommends the Company\u0092s\ninformation security policy and information\nsecurity program to the Board for approval. At\nleast annually, the Board reviews and\ndiscusses the Company\u0092s technology strategy\nwith the Chief Information Officer; reviews\nand discusses the Company\u0092s cybersecurity\nstrategy with the Chief Information Security\nOfficer and Chief Technology Risk Officer; and\napproves the Company\u0092s technology strategic\nplan. In addition, the Risk Committee\nparticipates in periodic cyber education\nsessions. Succession Planning Under the\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, the Board is\nresponsible for maintaining a succession plan\nfor the CEO and certain key executive roles.\nAn effective planning process has been\ndeveloped and maintained to identify, develop,\nand assess successors to the CEO and certain\nkey executives. The Board reviews these\nsuccession plans at least annually. Our Board\nbelieves that the directors and the CEO should\nwork together on executive succession planning\nand that the entire Board should be involved.\nEach year, as part of its succession planning\nprocess, our CEO provides the Board with\nrecommendations on, and evaluations of,\npotential CEO successors. The Board considers\na number of factors such as experience,\nskills, competencies, diversity, and potential\nin its review of the senior executive team to\nassess which executives possess or can develop\nthe attributes that the Board believes are\nnecessary to lead and achieve the Company\u0092s\ngoals. Among other steps taken to promote this\nprocess throughout the year, executives one\nand two levels below the CEO often attend\nBoard meetings and present to the Board,\nproviding the Board with numerous\nopportunities to interact with our senior\nmanagement and assess their leadership\ncapabilities. Additionally, each line of\nbusiness engages in succession planning for\nkey roles at least once per year. The Chief\nHuman Resources Officer reviews the line of\nbusiness succession plans. Our Board\nproactively reviewed plans for temporary\nemergency successors across key roles in late\n2021. The temporary emergency succession plan\nis intended to identify the leaders who can\nassume the responsibilities in the immediate\nshort term to ensure business continuity, day-\nto-daymanagement of the team and business for\nour senior management and key roles. Our Board\nalso has established steps to address\nemergency CEO succession planning for an\nunplanned CEO succession event. Our emergency\nCEO succession planning is intended to enable\nour Company to respond to an unexpected CEO\ntransition by continuing our Company\u0092s safe\nand sound operation and minimizing potential\ndisruption or loss of continuity to our\nCompany\u0092s operations and strategy. There is\nalso available, on a continuing basis as a\nresult of the process described above, the\nCEO\u0092s recommendation on a successor should the\nCEO become unexpectedly unable to serve. The\nBoard also reviews annually the CEO\u0092s\nemergency successor recommendations. Risk\nAssessment of Compensation Policies and\nPractices The Compensation Committee oversees\nall of our compensation policies and\npractices, including our incentive\ncompensation policies and practices, with a\nview toward ensuring that such policies and\npractices encourage\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  34    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nbalanced risk-taking, are compatible with\neffective controls and risk management, align\nwith our business strategy, and enable the\nCompany to attract and retain top talent,\nespecially in key job functions. Every two\nyears, the Compensation Committee reviews and\napproves the Incentive Compensation Governance\nPolicy, which applies to all Company\nassociates and governs incentive compensation\ndecisions. The Incentive Compensation\nGovernance Policy provides the framework for\noversight of the design of incentive\ncompensation programs. In setting executive\ncompensation, the Compensation Committee\nassesses each of the NEOs against one or more\nperformance objectives specifically designed\nto evaluate the degree to which the named\nexecutive officers balanced risks inherent in\ntheir specific roles. The Compensation\nCommittee also implements additional risk-\nbalancing features for certain equity awards,\nas described in more detail in the\n\u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0094\nbeginning on page 57. In addition, the\nCompensation Committee reviews the Company\u0092s\nNEO and other senior executive compensation\nprograms as well as any other material\nincentive compensation programs. During these\nreviews, the Compensation Committee discusses\nthe Company\u0092s most significant risks,\nincluding the Company\u0092s status with respect to\nmanaging those risks and the relationship of\nthose risks to compensation programs. The\nreview includes discussion and analysis of\nrisk-balancing features embedded in these\nincentive compensation programs and other\nactions taken by the Company to appropriately\nbalance risk and achieve conformance with\nregulatory guidance. The Compensation\nCommittee also discusses these programs with\nthe Company\u0092s Chief Risk Officer, Chief Human\nResources Officer, and the Compensation\nCommittee\u0092s independent compensation\nconsultant, as appropriate. Based on these\ndiscussions, the Compensation Committee\nbelieves these compensation programs are\nconsistent with safety and soundness, operate\nin a manner that appropriately balances risk,\nand are not reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company. The\nCompensation Committee\u0092s active oversight,\ntogether with the Company\u0092s interactions and\ndiscussions with its regulators, has further\nenhanced the Company\u0092s risk management and\ncontrol processes with respect to incentive\ncompensation at the Company and supported our\ncontinued compliance with the interagency\nguidance on sound incentive compensation\npractices. Stockholder Engagement We value the\ninput and insights of our stockholders and are\ncommitted to continued meaningful engagement\nwith investors. As a result, we engage in\ncontinuous outreach throughout the year to\ndiscuss with our stockholders the issues that\nare important to them, listen to their\nexpectations for us, and share our views.\nDuring our discussions, we also seek to\nprovide visibility and transparency into our\nbusiness, our performance, and our governance\nand compensation practices.

To strengthen our\noversight of ESG issues, in 2020 we\nestablished a cross-functional ESG Advisory\nCommittee, which is a management-level\ncommittee led by senior executives from across\nthe Company and chaired by our General Counsel\nand Corporate Secretary, that meets monthly to\nhelp guide our Company\u0092s ESG initiatives. In\nAugust 2021, we published a stand-alone ESG\nFact Sheet containing certain disclosures\naligned with frameworks developed by the Task\nForce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures\n(TCFD) and the Value Reporting Foundation\u0092s\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board\n(SASB).

In addition, our\nBoard takes ESG issues into consideration in\nmaking decisions about executive compensation.\nSee \u0093Company Performance Assessment\u0094 beginning\non page 78.

FW Cook provides\ncompetitive compensation data and director\ncompensation program recommendations to the\nCommittee to assist in determining its\nrecommendation. The competitive compensation\ndata includes information regarding the\ncompensation (cash, equity, and other\nbenefits) of the non-managementdirectors\nwithin Capital One\u0092s peer comparator group.\nThe Committee considers this information and\nFW Cook\u0092s recommendations, and finalizes a\nproposed director compensation structure for\nreview and approval by the full Board,\ntypically in the second quarter of each year.\nSee the discussion under \u0093Compensation\nCommittee Consultant\u0094 beginning on page 41 for\nfurther information on the role and\nresponsibilities of FW Cook and \u0093Peer Groups\u0094\nbeginning on page 93 for further information\non the selection of the Company\u0092s peer\ncomparator group. Based on its review of\ncompetitive market data and guidance from FW\nCook in the second quarter of 2021, the\nCommittee determined that the Company\u0092s\ndirector compensation program meets the\nobjectives listed above. Director Compensation\nStructure On May 6, 2021, the Board approved a\ncompensation program for Capital One\u0092s non-\nmanagementdirectors for the period from May 6,\n2021 through our 2022 Annual Stockholder\nMeeting that is similar to the program for the\npreceding year. The compensation program\nconsists of an annual cash retainer of $90,000\nfor service on the Board. Annual cash\nretainers for service as a member of the Board\nhave not increased since 2013. In addition,\ndirectors receive annual cash retainers for\ncommittee service and for service as committee\nchairs and Lead Independent Director. Under\nthe most recently approved director\ncompensation program, the annual cash\nretainers are as follows:\n                                           \n  \u220e    Lead Independent Director: $50,000  \n                                           \n                                              \n  \u220e    Chair of the Audit Committee or Risk   \n       Committee: $60,000                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Chair of the Compensation Committee:   \n       $40,000                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Chair of the Governance and            \n       Nominating Committee: $35,000          \n                                              \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  52    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                       \n  Section III - Director Compensation  \n                                       \n                                              \n       Member of the Audit Committee or Risk  \n  \u220e    Committee (other than the chair):      \n       $30,000                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Member of the Compensation Committee   \n  \u220e    or Governance and Nominating           \n       Committee (other than the chair):      \n       $15,000                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Member of the Capital One, N.A.

In addition, each non-\nmanagementdirector serving on May 6, 2021,\nother than Mr. Leroy, received on such date an\naward of 1,279 RSUs under the 2004 Stock\nIncentive Plan with a grant date fair value of\n$200,087 valued at $156.44 per share. Mr.\nLeroy retired from the Board, effective May 6,\n2021, and did not stand for re-election.The\nRSU award reflects an approximate $20,000\nincrease in value over the previous year,\nwhich was intended to better align director\ncompensation with the Company\u0092s peer group.\nThe RSUs were valued based on the fair market\nvalue of a share of Capital One common stock\non the date of grant and vest one year from\nthe date of grant, with the delivery of the\nunderlying shares deferred until the\ndirector\u0092s service with the Board ends in\norder to enhance the alignment of interests\nbetween our non-managementdirectors and\nstockholders. On November 5, 2021, Ms. Detrick\nreceived a pro-ratedaward of RSUs under the\n2004 Stock Incentive Plan for service from the\ndate of her appointment through our 2022\nAnnual Stockholder Meeting. Other Benefits\nUnder the Capital One Financial Corporation\nNon-EmployeeDirectors Deferred Compensation\nPlan, non-managementdirectors may voluntarily\ndefer all or a portion of their cash\ncompensation and receive deferred income\nbenefits. Participants in the plan can direct\ntheir individual deferrals among ten\ninvestments available through the plan.\nParticipating directors receive their deferred\nincome benefits in cash when they cease\nserving as directors, upon certain other\ndistribution events specified in the plan, or\nat such earlier time as authorized by the\nCommittee. Upon a change of control, Capital\nOne will pay to each director within 30 days\nof the change of control a lump sum cash\npayment equal to such director\u0092s account\nbalance as of the date of the change of\ncontrol. Capital One offers non-\nmanagementdirectors the opportunity to direct\na contribution of up to $10,000 annually from\nCapital One to charitable organization(s) of\ntheir choice. Thirteen of the fourteen non-\nmanagementdirectors who served during 2021\nelected to make such a charitable contribution\nin 2021. In addition, all directors who served\nduring 2021 were eligible, and five directors\nelected, to participate in a Capital One\nbroad-based charitable contribution program,\nwhich is available to Capital One associates,\nunder which Capital One made a contribution of\n$5,000 per director to a charitable\norganization of their choice. Directors also\nreceive reimbursements for certain board-\nrelated expenses, including external\neducational seminars and travel-related costs\nincurred to attend Board meetings. Such\nreimbursements are not included as\ncompensation for the directors in the table\nbelow.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            53  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                       \n  Section III - Director Compensation  \n                                       \nCompensation of Directors Directors of Capital\nOne received the following compensation in\n2021:\n                                              \n            Fees                              \n          Earned                All           \n  Dir\u2026        or    Stock     Other    Total  \n  Name      Paid    Awar\u2026    Compe\u2026           \n              in                              \n          Cash(\u2026                              \n  Ric\u2026                                        \n  D.           $\u0097        $\u0097         $\u0097        $\u0097  \n  Fai\u2026                                        \n  Ime     $75,0\u2026    $245\u2026    $10,0\u2026    $330\u2026  \n  Arc\u2026                                        \n  Apa\u2026    $67,5\u2026        $\u0097    $3,701    $71,\u2026  \n  Che\u2026                                        \n  Chr\u2026    $37,5\u2026    $100\u2026    $10,0\u2026    $147\u2026  \n  Det\u2026                                        \n  Ann                                         \n  Fri\u2026    $220,\u2026    $200\u2026    $15,0\u2026    $435\u2026  \n  Hac\u2026                                        \n  Pet\u2026                                        \n  T.      $135,\u2026    $200\u2026    $10,0\u2026    $345\u2026  \n  Kil\u2026                                        \n  Eli     $190,\u2026    $200\u2026    $10,0\u2026    $400\u2026  \n  Lee\u2026                                        \n  Pie\u2026                                        \n  E.      $82,5\u2026        $\u0097    $19,7\u2026    $102\u2026  \n  Ler\u2026                                        \n  Fra\u2026    $132,\u2026    $200\u2026    $15,0\u2026    $347\u2026  \n  Loc\u2026                                        \n  Pet\u2026                                        \n  E.      $165,\u2026    $200\u2026    $15,0\u2026    $380\u2026  \n  Ras\u2026                                        \n  Eil\u2026    $150,\u2026    $200\u2026    $10,0\u2026    $360\u2026  \n  Ser\u2026                                        \n  Mayo                                        \n  A.      $140,\u2026    $200\u2026    $15,0\u2026    $355\u2026  \n  Sha\u2026                                        \n  III                                         \n  Bra\u2026                                        \n  H.      $180,\u2026    $200\u2026    $10,0\u2026    $390\u2026  \n  War\u2026                                        \n  Cat\u2026                                        \n  G.      $150,\u2026    $200\u2026    $10,0\u2026    $360\u2026  \n  West                                        \n  Cra\u2026                                        \n  Ant\u2026    $82,5\u2026    $245\u2026    $10,0\u2026    $337\u2026  \n  Wil\u2026                                        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents cash payments made during   \n       2021, which include half of the        \n       payments made under the compensation   \n       program for                            \n       the period from May\u00a06, 2021 through    \n  (1)  our 2022 Annual Stockholder Meeting    \n       and half of the payments made under    \n       the compensation program for the       \n       period from April\u00a030, 2020 through     \n       the date of our 2021 Annual            \n       Stockholder Meeting.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Represents the grant date fair value   \n  (2)  of RSUs granted during 2021,           \n       calculated in accordance with FASB     \n       ASC Topic 718.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Amounts shown represent contributions  \n       made by Capital One on behalf of       \n       certain                                \n       non-management directors serving       \n       during 2021 to charitable              \n       organization(s) of their choice.

The Board may grant an exception for any\ncase where this requirement would impose a\nfinancial hardship on a director. In 2021, no\ndirectors were granted an exception to this\nrequirement for any outstanding awards of\nRSUs. Beginning in 2019, our non-\nmanagementdirector stock ownership policies\nalso require our non-management directors to\nhold a number of shares of Capital One\u0092s\ncommon stock with a fair market value of at\nleast five times the director\u0092s annual cash\nretainer for Board service. For purposes of\nthis policy, unvested RSUs and vested deferred\nRSUs held by a Board member are counted as\nshares when determining the number of shares\nowned. All of the directors are currently in\ncompliance with this requirement.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            55  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection IV - Proposal 2: Advisory Approval of\nCapital One\u0092s 2021 Named Executive Officer\nCompensation (Item 2 on Proxy Card) We are\noffering to our stockholders a non-\nbindingadvisory vote to approve our 2021 named\nexecutive officer compensation, pursuant to\nSection 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (\u0093Exchange Act\u0094). While the\nvote is non-binding,the Board of Directors\nvalues the opinions that stockholders express\nthrough their votes and in any additional\ndialogue. The Board of Directors will consider\nthe outcome of the vote when making future\ncompensation decisions. As discussed in the\n\u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0094 section\nbeginning on page 57, our Board of Directors\ngenerally has provided compensation programs\nfor the CEO and the other NEOs that are\ncompetitive with the market, performance-\nbased, and transparent and that align with our\nstockholders\u0092 interests over multiple time\nhorizons. Our CEO\u0092s and other NEOs\u0092\ncompensation programs generally have consisted\nprimarily of performance-based incentive\nopportunities, including multiple types of\nequity instruments with multi-year vesting\nschedules. The ultimate value of these equity-\nbased awards is subject to Capital One\u0092s\nsustained performance over time, both on an\nabsolute basis and relative to our peers. For\nthe 2021 performance year, approximately 83%\nof the CEO\u0092s total compensation is equity-\nbased and at-riskto the performance of the\nCompany\u0092s stock price, and 100% of his\ncompensation is deferred for a three-year\nperiod. As discussed under \u0093NEO Compensation\u0094\nbeginning on page 84, under the 2021 NEO\ncompensation program applicable to our other\nNEOs (other than our former CFO),\napproximately 51% of total compensation is\nprovided through equity-based vehicles which\nwere all at-riskbased on the performance of\nthe Company\u0092s stock price and subject to\nvesting over multiple time horizons.\nAdditional information relevant to your vote\ncan be found under \u0093Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis\u0094 on pages 57 to 97 and \u0093Named\nExecutive Officer Compensation\u0094 section on\npages 98 to 114.

We\nreached all-timehighs in revenues, profits,\nearnings per share, capital distribution,\nshare price, and market value. After taking\nappropriate actions in 2020 to reduce risk,\nsupport customers, and react swiftly to\nuncertain economic and market conditions, we\nreturned to growth in our Credit Card business\nand delivered solid growth across each of our\nother major lines of business that drove\nhigher revenues. Growth was driven by\ndeepening engagement with existing customers\nas well as an expansion in new customer\nrelationships as we launched new products and\nexperiences in our Retail Banking, Credit\nCard, and Auto Finance franchises. An increase\nin credit card loan balances and purchase\nvolumes drove revenues in our Credit Card\nbusiness to reach the highest level in our\nhistory. Similarly, our Auto Finance business\nposted solid top-lineoriginations and loan\ngrowth. We continued to expand our national\nretail bank franchise with solid 6% deposit\ngrowth, and our Commercial Banking business\noutpaced the growth of the industry. Solid\nunderwriting and strikingly strong credit\nresults drove improvement in customer charge-\noffs and resulted in large releases from our\nreserve for expected credit losses. Operating\nexpenses grew at a slower rate than revenues,\nleading to an improvement in operating\nefficiency ratio (1)(2)(3)by 213 basis points\nto 45.0%. Operating efficiency ratio, net of\nadjustments, improved by 133 basis points to\n44.7%. In addition, management stayed keenly\nfocused on delivering shareholder value.\nStrong capital levels and record earnings\nsupported about $8.7 billion of capital\ndistribution to common stockholders through a\ncombination of share repurchases and common\ndividends, including a special dividend in the\nthird quarter and an increase in the quarterly\ncommon dividend from $0.40 to $0.60 beginning\nin the third quarter. Capital One\u0092s share\nprice ended the year at $145.09, up 46.8% from\nyear-end2020. Our stock price growth\nsignificantly outperformed the largest\nbenchmark of our bank peers, the KBW Bank\nIndex, and our TSR outperformed the KBW Bank\nIndex by 11 percentage points.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  58    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nWe achieved exceptional 2021 financial\nperformance while continuing to invest in\ntransformation, talent, growth, and our long-\nterm technology capabilities. Our long-term\ninvestments in modern infrastructure,\ntechnology tools, and enterprise\ntransformation are driving growth, speed-to-\nmarket,and improvements to the customer\nexperience. In 2021, we also invested\nsignificantly in marketing and advertising to\nsupport new products and experiences across\nour major consumer franchises and welcomed\nmillions of new customers to Capital One. We\nearned a number of external awards and\naccolades related to our products and customer\nexperiences and continued to be recognized for\nour customer satisfaction and advocacy. Net\nPromoter Scores, which measure how likely a\ncustomer is to recommend our products and\nservices, reached record highs across a number\nof our major businesses. Despite increased\ninvestments in these areas, we began to\nharness the power of our migration to the\ncloud and realize cost benefits of our exits\nfrom data centers. Our technology capabilities\ndelivered significant cost savings in areas\nlike fraud. We also strengthened our risk and\ncontrol environment and continued to enhance\ncybersecurity. We invested heavily in\nrecruiting, developing, and retaining talent\nand we welcomed thousands of new associates\nand have maintained strong associate morale\nand engagement despite ongoing stresses\nrelated to the pandemic. We made progress on\nour diversity and inclusion efforts, and self-\nreported surveys of inclusion remain very\nhigh. We were recognized as one of the best-\nmanaged companies in America and ranked #9 on\nFortune magazine\u0092s prestigious Best Places to\nWork list, our highest ranking ever. We\ninvested in the community through our Capital\nOne Impact Initiative, putting particular\nemphasis on advancing socioeconomic mobility\nand racial equity. We became the first of the\ntop-tenretail banks in the United States to\nannounce a no-feeoverdraft policy for all\nconsumer checking customers. We believe our\nportfolio of structurally-attractive\nbusinesses, coupled with our long-term\ninvestments in technology, talent, and digital\ncapabilities, positions us well for future\ngrowth and the creation of long-term\nstockholder value. Each year the Committee and\nthe Independent Directors review and evaluate\nthe Company\u0092s qualitative and quantitative\nperformance and make determinations regarding\nthe compensation of our NEOs based on Capital\nOne\u0092s pay-for-performancephilosophy. The\nCommittee\u0092s top priority is to implement a\ncompensation program that aligns the interests\nof our NEOs with the interests of our\nstockholders. See \u0093Consideration of\nStockholder Feedback and 2021 Say on Pay Vote\u0094\nbeginning on page 65 for information regarding\nenhancements made to our executive\ncompensation programs and disclosures as a\nresult of stockholder feedback. The Committee\nalso seeks to directly link the compensation\nof the NEOs with the Company\u0092s performance,\nand the executives\u0092 contributions to that\nperformance over appropriate time horizons,\nwhile supporting safety, soundness and\nappropriately balancing risk. The Committee\nand the Independent Directors have the\nflexibility to adjust compensation decisions\nfrom year to year to take into account Company\nand individual performance, as well as\nevolving market practices and external\nbenchmarks.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            59  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nCompany Performance Highlights The tables\nbelow show our reported year-over-year\nperformance across key financial metrics\n(dollar amounts in billions other than per\nshare amounts) (1):\n                                              \n  Diluted EPS(2)    Average Loans Held for    \n                    Investment                \n  Net               Operating Efficiency      \n  Revenue(2)        Ratio(2)                  \n  ROTCE(4)          Tangible Book Value /     \n                    Common Share              \n                                              \nIn particular, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors specifically considered\nthe following quantitative and qualitative\nCompany performance when awarding compensation\nfor the 2021 performance year to our NEOs (1):\n                                              \n       Diluted EPS of $26.94, an increase of  \n       420% from 2020, driven by strong       \n       growth in                              \n       loans and revenues, exceptional        \n  \u220e    credit performance, and the            \n       significant decrease to the allowance  \n       for credit losses. 2021 EPS was more   \n       than double the next-highest level of  \n       annual earnings in Capital One\u0092s        \n       history.                               \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net Revenue of $30.4\u00a0billion, an       \n       increase of 6.7% from 2020 and the     \n       highest in                             \n       the Company\u0092s history.

We  \n       enhanced our product offerings and     \n       digital customer experiences           \n       including Venture X, Capital One Auto  \n       Navigator, Capital One Shopping, and   \n       a number of premium products and       \n       experiences.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Elimination of Overdraft Fees. In      \n       2021, we became the first top-ten      \n       retail bank to provide free overdraft  \n       protection and eliminate all           \n       overdraft and non-sufficient funds     \n       fees for all consumer banking          \n  \u220e    customers. Overdraft protection is     \n       a valuable and convenient feature and  \n       can be an important safety net for     \n       families. This decision serves as yet  \n       another example of how we are          \n       reimagining banking and helping        \n       customers succeed.                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Progress on ESG Initiatives.

At our\n2021 Annual Stockholder Meeting, 93% of our\nstockholders supported our executive\ncompensation program by approving our non-\nbindingadvisory vote on executive compensation\n(\u00932021 Say on Pay Vote\u0094). Though the Committee\nrecognized the 2021 Say on Pay Vote reflected\nstrong support for the Company\u0092s executive\ncompensation programs, the Committee remains\ncommitted to stockholder engagement. In 2021,\nwe continued to strengthen our outreach to\nstockholders to maintain strong lines of\ncommunication with our stockholders and shared\nstockholders\u0092 perspectives with the Committee\nand the Board. In 2021, management directly\nengaged with stockholders representing\napproximately 70% of our outstanding shares in\nover 170 interactions with investors. See\n\u0093Stockholder Engagement Program\u0094 beginning on\npage 35 for more information. From this\noutreach, the Committee and the Board gained\nvaluable insight into our investors\u0092 views\nabout the Company, including our executive\ncompensation programs. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors considered these views\nand feedback in approving year-endincentive\nawards for 2021 and structuring and approving\nthe 2022 compensation programs for the NEOs.\nIn recent years, as a result of the feedback\nreceived from investors, the Committee made\nthe following enhancements to our executive\ncompensation programs and disclosure:\n                                              \n       Linked a Portion of CEO Compensation   \n       Directly to Relative TSR. Several      \n       stockholders                           \n       expressed that TSR is an important     \n       element of Company performance and     \n       asked that the Company consider a      \n       more direct link between CEO           \n       compensation and the Company\u0092s TSR      \n       over time. Beginning with the 2020     \n       performance year, the Committee and    \n       the                                    \n       Independent Directors determined to    \n       award a portion of the CEO\u0092s year-end   \n       incentive in the form of a             \n       performance share award that vests     \n       entirely based on the Company\u0092s TSR     \n  \u220e    over a three-year                      \n       performance period relative to the     \n       Performance Share Peers. While TSR     \n       has been, and continues to be,         \n       explicitly included in the financial   \n       and operating performance factors      \n       considered by the Committee and the    \n       Independent Directors to determine     \n       all                                    \n       NEO year-end incentive awards, the     \n       Committee and the Independent          \n       Directors believe that linking a       \n       portion of CEO long-term compensation  \n       entirely to the Company\u0092s three-year    \n       TSR further aligns the                 \n       interests of our CEO with the          \n       interests of stockholders over time.   \n                                              \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            65  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Disclosure of Performance Share        \n       Awards Realized Compensation.

In July 2020, the        \n  \u220e    Committee and the Independent          \n       Directors increased the size and       \n       diversity of the Company\u0092s              \n       peer group to add seven additional     \n       peers, including diversified           \n       financial institutions and payment     \n       companies with whom we compete for     \n       executive talent. See \u0093Peer Groups\u0094      \n       beginning on page 93 for more          \n       information.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Increased Alignment of CEO Pay and     \n       Performance. Beginning with the 2019   \n       performance                            \n       year, the Committee and the            \n       Independent Directors increased the    \n       alignment of CEO compensation with     \n       Company performance and stockholder    \n       interests by decreasing the amount of  \n       the CEO\u0092s compensation awarded at the   \n       beginning of the performance year      \n       such that the vast majority of CEO     \n       compensation is tied to a year-end     \n       evaluation of CEO and Company          \n       performance. The Committee and the     \n       Independent Directors believe that     \n       this structure further aligns          \n       Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u0092s compensation with that   \n  \u220e    of the Company\u0092s peers and provides a   \n       greater opportunity for the Committee  \n       and the Independent Directors to       \n       assess the Company and the CEO\u0092s        \n       performance after the completion of    \n       the                                    \n       performance year. In addition, this    \n       structure enhances the Committee and   \n       the Independent Directors\u0092 ability to   \n       incorporate feedback from              \n       stockholders received during the year  \n       to ensure that the CEO\u0092s performance    \n       year compensation                      \n       appropriately reflects the Company\u0092s    \n       compensation philosophy and            \n       principles and business results.

Strongly link pay and\nperformance by providing compensation based on\nboth business and individual performance while\nappropriately balancing risk Capital One\nemphasizes pay-for-performanceat all\norganizational levels. Typically, as an\nexecutive\u0092s level of responsibility increases,\nso does the proportion of the executive\u0092s pay\nthat is subject to performance criteria.\nTherefore, the NEOs have the highest\nproportion of their pay directly linked to\nCompany and individual performance, as\ncompared to other associates. Awards made to\nthe NEOs in February 2022 for the 2021\nperformance year were based on Company and\nindividual performance, and on demonstrating\nspecific leadership competencies assessed\nthrough a comprehensive performance management\nprocess that included an individual assessment\nspecifically designed to evaluate the degree\nto which the executive balanced risks inherent\nto his or her role. The Chief Risk Officer\ncompiled these risk assessments and the Chief\nHuman Resources Officer reviewed the\nassessments for the NEOs. Separately, the\nChief Audit Officer compiled and reviewed the\nrisk assessment for the Chief Risk Officer.\nThe Committee considered the assessments in\nmaking its determinations regarding individual\nperformance and compensation levels. Align our\nexecutives\u0092 interests with those of our\nstockholders The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors are committed to designing incentive\ncompensation programs that reward individual\nand Company performance and that are aligned\nwith the creation of stockholder value over\nthe long term. Beginning with the 2020\nperformance year, a portion of the CEO\u0092s\nperformance share award is linked to the\nCompany\u0092s relative TSR over a three-year\nperiod. Because NEO compensation is primarily\ndelivered through deferred, equity-based\nvehicles that vest over multiple time\nhorizons, the NEOs have a significant stake in\nthe success of the Company. The Committee and\nthe Independent Directors also have the\nflexibility to adjust compensation decisions\nfrom year to year to take into account the\nCompany\u0092s performance and evolving market\npractices. In addition, we have established\nspecific stock ownership policies that the\nNEOs must meet and stock retention provisions\napplicable to certain equity awards. Reward\nperformance over multiple time horizons Our\ncompensation programs are structured to\nencourage our executives to deliver strong\nresults over the short term while making\ndecisions that create sustained value for our\nstockholders over the long term. For 2021,\napproximately 83% of the CEO\u0092s total\ncompensation was equity-based and at-riskto\nthe performance of the Company\u0092s stock price,\nand 100% of his compensation was deferred for\na three-year period. In addition,\napproximately 51% of total compensation for\nNEOs other than the CEO and the former CFO was\nprovided through equity-based vehicles which\nwere at-riskto the performance of the\nCompany\u0092s stock price and subject to vesting\nover multiple time horizons. The use of\ndeferred, equity-based compensation vehicles\nwith multi-year vesting terms advances our\ngoal of aligning the ultimate value realized\nby the NEOs with the performance of the\nCompany\u0092s stock over time because the value of\nthese compensation vehicles increases and\ndecreases based on the performance of the\nCompany\u0092s stock price in both current and\nfuture periods. Attract, retain, and motivate\ntop executive talent To attract, retain, and\nmotivate exceptional leaders, we believe that\ncompensation opportunities at Capital One must\nbe competitive with the marketplace for\ntalent. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors strive to preserve a competitive pay\nmix and total target compensation values in\nthe executive compensation program, as well as\nprovide competitive total rewards based on our\nselected peer group.

By applying informed\njudgment, the Committee seeks to mitigate the\nrisks associated with a rigid and strictly\nformulaic compensation program, which could\nunintentionally create incentives for our\nexecutives to focus only on certain\nperformance metrics, encourage imprudent risk-\ntaking, and not provide the best long-term\nresults for stockholders. In addition, the use\nof judgment allows the Committee to respond to\nchanges in economic conditions, our operating\nenvironment, and other significant factors\nthat may affect the long-term performance of\nCapital One or our lines of business. The use\nof judgment also allows the Committee to\nadjust compensation based on factors that\nwould not be appropriately reflected by a\nstrictly formulaic approach, such as risk\nmanagement, championing Company values, and\nthe discrepancies between absolute and\nrelative performance levels or recognition of\nindividual performance levels. There are\ncertain performance conditions for which the\nCommittee would not exercise judgment, for\nexample where the minimum performance metric\nis not met in the award of performance shares\nor if the performance-based vesting\nrequirements applicable to certain other\nstock-settled awards are not met. Our\nCompensation Governance Cycle The Committee is\nactively engaged throughout the year and\nmembers of the Committee regularly meet with\nmanagement regarding the Company\u0092s executive\ncompensation programs and practices. In\naddition, the Committee receives updates, at\nleast quarterly, at the Board level, regarding\nthe Company\u0092s financial and strategic\nperformance, including information regarding\nthe Company\u0092s performance against the four\ncategories of quantitative and qualitative\nperformance factors related to: financial and\noperating performance, governance and risk\nmanagement, strategic performance, and winning\nwith our customers and associates (the\n\u0093Performance Factors\u0094) that are used by the\nCommittee to determine the year-endincentive\nawards to the NEOs. The Committee met three\ntimes in 2021, with each meeting concluding\nwith an executive session without management\npresent. In addition, the Committee held three\njoint meetings with the Board in 2021, and an\nadditional joint meeting was held at the\nbeginning of 2022 to assess Company and NEO\nperformance and determine the year-\nendincentive awards for the NEOs.

Any year-\nendincentive award granted to the CEO (i)\nwould continue to consist primarily of a\nperformance share award, under which he may\nreceive 0% to 150% of a target number of\nshares of the Company\u0092s common stock based on\nthe Company\u0092s performance over a three-year\nperiod; and (ii) may also consist of deferred\ncash, an equity-based award, or both. In this\nmanner, the CEO\u0092s compensation will continue\nto be completely at-riskbased on the Company\u0092s\nand Mr. Fairbank\u0092s performance, and all CEO\ncompensation continues to be subject to a\nthree-year deferred vesting or payout. As in\nprior years, Mr. Fairbank did not receive any\ncash salary in 2021.

Restricted Stock Units A portion of Mr.\nFairbank\u0092s 2021 compensation consisted of RSUs\ngranted as an incentive for long-term Company\nperformance. The RSU award vests in full at\nthe end of a three-year performance period\nbeginning on January 1, 2021, settles in cash\nbased on the Company\u0092s average stock price\nover the 15 trading days preceding the vesting\ndate, and is subject to performance-based\nvesting provisions and clawback provisions,\neach as described in more detail under\n\u0093Additional Performance Conditions and\nRecovery Provisions\u0094 beginning on page 90.\nYear-EndIncentive Opportunity A portion of Mr.\nFairbank\u0092s 2021 compensation consisted of an\nopportunity for a year-endincentive based on\nthe Committee\u0092s evaluation of the Company\u0092s\nperformance during 2021 and Mr. Fairbank\u0092s\ncontributions to that performance. For\npurposes of the year-endincentive, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors assess\nthe Company\u0092s performance based on the\nPerformance Factors. The Committee believes\nthat these factors appropriately reflect and\nbalance near-term performance and long-term\nsuccess for the Company\u0092s customers,\nassociates, and stockholders. The Company\u0092s\n2021 performance against the Performance\nFactors is described in more detailed under\n\u00932021 Year-EndIncentive Determination\u0094\nbeginning on page 76. The year-endincentive,\nif awarded, (i) will consist of an award of\nperformance shares, and (ii) may also consist\nof deferred cash, an equity-based award, or\nboth as determined by the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors at the time the award is\ngranted. The performance share awards, the\nequity-based award, and the deferred cash\nbonus each have a three-year cliff-vesting\nschedule and are subject to clawback\nprovisions. The performance-based vesting\nprovisions applicable to the equity-based\naward and the clawback provisions applicable\nto all three awards are described in more\ndetail under \u0093Additional Performance\nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u0094 beginning\non page 90. Performance Share Awards The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\nbelieve the performance shares strengthen the\nalignment between the compensation of our NEOs\nand the Company\u0092s performance by linking the\nultimate payout to pre-establishedabsolute\nand/or relative performance goals, with the\nvalue of the payout ranging from 0% to 150%.\nThe ultimate value of the performance shares\nupon vesting is determined by the Company\u0092s\nperformance through its stock price. The CEO\nyear-endincentive award consists primarily of\nperformance shares. For the other NEOs, the\nperformance share awards represent\napproximately 30% of total target\ncompensation. For 2021, the performance share\nawards were granted in two forms:\n                                              \n       Financial Performance Share Units      \n       (\u0093Financial Performance Shares\u0094) that    \n       vest based on the Company\u0092s             \n       financial performance, on an absolute  \n       basis and relative to the Performance  \n       Share Peers, related to a combination  \n       of two metrics: Common Dividends plus  \n       Growth of Tangible Book Value per      \n       share (\u0093D+TBV\u0094) and Adjusted Return on   \n       Tangible                               \n       Common Equity (\u0093Adjusted ROTCE\u0094) over a  \n       three-year period.

TSR is\nviewed by investors as a key indicator of the\nCompany\u0092s performance. The TSR Performance\nShares create a direct link between CEO\ncompensation and the Company\u0092s stock price and\nvalue creation over time. In addition, a\nsignificant portion of CEO pay is delivered\nthrough equity-based awards, the ultimate\nvalue of which will increase or decrease based\non the performance of the Company\u0092s stock\nprice in both current and future periods.\nPerformance Share Award Peer Group. For both\nthe Financial Performance Shares and the TSR\nPerformance Shares, the Company\u0092s performance\non each metric is assessed over the three-year\nperiod relative to the Performance Share Peers\nwhich are constituents of the KBW Bank Index,\nexcluding three non-traditionalbanks that do\nnot focus on lending to consumers and\nbusinesses (\u0093KBW Index\u0094). The Committee\nbelieves that the KBW Index is an appropriate\nindex against which to assess the Company\u0092s\nperformance because it reflects institutions\nof a comparable size, risk profile, and\nbusiness mix to the Company. After the end of\nthe three-year performance period, the\nCommittee will certify the Company\u0092s\nperformance and issue the corresponding number\nof shares of the Company\u0092s common stock, if\nany, in accordance with the relative\nperformance hurdles illustrated below. Each of\nthe metrics will be calculated as indicated\nabove, with the Committee excluding from such\ncalculations the initial effects of changes in\ntax laws, accounting principles or\nregulations, or other laws or provisions\naffecting the reported results if the\nCommittee determines that such adjustments are\nappropriate in order to prevent dilution or\nenlargement of the benefits or potential\nbenefits intended to be made available under\nthe 2004 Stock Incentive Plan as necessary or\nappropriate to comply with applicable laws,\nrules, or regulations. Performance Share Award\nFormula. For all performance share awards, the\nultimate number of performance shares earned\nat vesting is determined by a formula based on\nrelative performance and/or absolute\nperformance (in the form of a performance\nshare reduction) measures, with the value of\nthe payout ranging from 0% to 150% of the\ntarget performance shares. In addition, the\nvalue of the performance shares upon vesting\nis determined by the Company\u0092s stock price\nperformance. All performance share awards are\nsubject to the Relative Performance Measure\n(as described below). Only the Financial\nPerformance Shares are subject to the Absolute\nPerformance Measure\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  74    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n(as described below). The award agreements\napplicable to all performance share awards\npermit the Committee to exclude the initial\neffects of changes in tax laws, accounting\nprinciples or regulations, or other laws or\nprovisions affecting the reported results if\nthe Committee determines that such adjustments\nare appropriate in order to prevent dilution\nor enlargement of the benefits or potential\nbenefits intended to be made available under\nthe 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or necessary or\nappropriate to comply with applicable laws,\nrules, or regulations. Relative Performance\nMeasure - Financial Performance Shares and TSR\nPerformance Shares. Each year, the Committee\nand the Independent Directors assess the\nCompany\u0092s performance on the basis of the\nperformance share award metrics relative to\nthe Performance Share Peers. The Company\u0092s TSR\nor positive Adjusted ROTCE and D+TBV, as\napplicable, must be at least at the 25th\npercentile of the Performance Share Peers for\nany performance shares to vest; target payout\nwill be achieved at the 55th percentile of the\nPerformance Share Peers; and the maximum\npayout can only be achieved if the Company\nperforms at the 80th percentile of the\nPerformance Share Peers or greater. If the\nCompany\u0092s TSR or Adjusted ROTCE and D+TBV, as\napplicable, is under the 25th percentile, none\nof the shares will vest and no payout will be\nmade with respect to the award. After the end\nof the three-year performance period, the\nCommittee will certify the Company\u0092s\nperformance and issue the corresponding number\nof shares of the Company\u0092s common stock, if\nany, in accordance with the graph below.\nPayouts will range between the values shown\nbelow for performance that falls between the\npoints labeled in the graph. Absolute\nPerformance Measure (Performance Share\nReduction) - Financial Performance Shares. The\nFinancial Performance Shares are subject to a\nperformance share reduction feature under\nwhich the number of shares issued at\nsettlement will be reduced if the Company\u0092s\nAdjusted ROTCE for one or more fiscal years\ncompleted during the performance period is not\npositive, no matter how well the Company\nperforms compared to the Performance Share\nPeers. In each year that the Company does not\nachieve positive Adjusted ROTCE, the executive\nwill forfeit 50% of that year\u0092s worth of\nperformance shares. If the Company\u0092s Adjusted\nROTCE is not positive in each of the three\nfiscal years in the performance period, the\nexecutive will forfeit the entire award of\nperformance shares. See \u0093Performance Share\nReduction\u0094 on page 91 and \u0093Financial\nRestatement Clawbacks\u0094 on page 92 for more\ninformation.

The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\nbelieve that this pay-for-\nperformancestructure, which emphasizes\nvariable pay, incentivizes the CEO to invest\nfor the long-term, grow resiliently, manage\nrisk, and deliver sustained stockholder value.\nIn addition, the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors believe this approach is in the best\ninterests of the stockholders and provides the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors a\ngreater opportunity to determine the amount\nand form of compensation based on CEO and\nCompany performance and stockholder feedback\nas well as being able to respond to then-\ncurrent business conditions, the dynamic\nnature of executive compensation practices,\nand developments in our business and industry.\n2021 Restricted Stock Unit Award In February\n2021, the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors awarded Mr. Fairbank 15,534 RSUs,\nwhich had a total grant date value of\napproximately $1.75 million.

Fairbank\u0092s\ncontributions to the Company\u0092s 2021\nperformance. Under Mr. Fairbank\u0092s stewardship,\nCapital One achieved record financial results\nand demonstrated strong operating and risk\nperformance. Mr. Fairbank successfully\nbalanced and integrated Capital One\u0092s\ninvestments in growth and long-term\ncapabilities while achieving outstanding\nfinancial results and stewardship of\nstockholder capital. In 2021, Capital One\nachieved record revenues, net income, earnings\nper share, and capital distribution. Our stock\nprice ended the year up 46.8% from the year\nend 2020 and our one-yearTSR outpaced the\nlargest benchmark of peer banks, the KBW Bank\nIndex, by 11 percentage points. After taking\nswift and decisive actions in 2020 to respond\nto the COVID-19pandemic and subsequent\neconomic downturn, Mr. Fairbank led Capital\nOne in delivering exceptional financial\nperformance and growth across all key lines of\nbusiness while advancing the Company\u0092s long-\nterm strategy and capabilities. As a result of\nMr. Fairbank\u0092s visionary leadership in driving\ntransformational investments in technology,\ntalent, infrastructure, data, products, and\ncustomer experience, our businesses thrived in\n2021. We returned to growth in our Credit Card\nbusiness and achieved record earnings and\npurchase volume. We launched, refreshed or\nscaled many products and services across our\nfranchises and created new capabilities and\ncustomer experiences across our Credit Card\nand Consumer Banking businesses. We delivered\nstrong growth in both retail deposits and auto\nloan originations, and achieved record loan\nand deposit balances, revenues, and pre-\nprovisionincome in our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. Mr. Fairbank was also instrumental\nin positioning the Company to make the\nstrategic choice to completely eliminate\noverdraft fees for all consumer checking\ncustomers.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  80    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nIn addition, Capital One accelerated its\nmomentum toward the achievement of its long-\nterm strategic objectives, including\nleveraging technology investments to drive\nresults and innovation, adapting to a complex\nand changing competitive environment, and\nstrengthening risk management and controls.\nMr. Fairbank also continued to model and\nreinforce the Company\u0092s culture, values, and\nmission through strategic business choices and\nwith key stakeholders, including associates,\npartners, suppliers, and investors. During\n2021, Capital One recruited great talent in a\ncompetitive market and maintained high\nassociate engagement and morale, as measured\nin our regular enterprise-wide surveys, and\nwas recognized for being a great place to\nwork. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors also took into account Mr.\nFairbank\u0092s unique role as the founder of\nCapital One, as well as peer group CEO\ncompensation levels and structure, the tenures\nof each of the peer companies\u0092 CEOs, and the\nvarying degrees of success those CEOs have had\nin leading their respective companies in 2021\nand over time. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors also recognized that Mr.\nFairbank does not receive a cash salary, and\n100% of his compensation is deferred for at\nleast three years. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors believe that the actions\ntaken by Mr. Fairbank and the other NEOs\nthroughout 2021 drove incredible financial\nresults and advanced the Company\u0092s long-term\njourney toward achieving its strategic\nobjectives. These actions also harnessed the\nunique market opportunities that followed the\ninitial pandemic, and have positioned the\nCompany to deliver strong and sustainable\nfuture financial performance and resilience\nwhile creating enduring value over the long\nterm. CEO Compensation by Performance Year\nBelow is a table showing Mr. Fairbank\u0092s\ncompensation awards as they are attributable\nto the performance years indicated.

Each year, the Committee\nand the Independent Directors assess the\nCompany\u0092s relative performance based on the\napplicable performance share award metrics\nrelative to the Performance Share Peers over\nthe three-year performance period, and where\nappropriate, apply a performance share\nreduction based on the Company\u0092s absolute\nperformance. See \u0093Performance Share Award\nFormula\u0094 beginning on page 74 for a\ndescription of the performance share award\nformula applicable to the 2019 Financial\nPerformance Shares. Based on the Committee and\nIndependent Directors\u0092 assessment of the\nCompany\u0092s relative and absolute performance\nover the three-year performance period, the\n2019 Financial Performance Shares settled at\n150% of their target value. Two-thirdsof each\nFinancial Performance Share award vested based\non D+TBV, and one-thirdof each performance\nshare award vested based on Adjusted ROTCE.\nThe Company performed at the 90th percentile\nrelative to the KBW Index with respect to\nD+TBV and at the 85th percentile relative to\nthe KBW Index with respect to Adjusted ROTCE.\nThe Company achieved positive Adjusted ROTCE\nfor each of the three years of the performance\nsuch that the 2019 Financial Performance\nShares settled without a performance share\nreduction. See \u0093Absolute Performance Measure\n(Performance Share Reduction) \u0097 Financial\nPerformance Shares\u0094 beginning on page 75 for\nmore information regarding the performance\nshare reduction feature applicable to the 2019\nFinancial Performance Shares. As permitted\nunder the applicable award agreements, the\nCommittee determined it appropriate to\nevaluate Tangible Book Value (as defined on\npage 73 under \u0093Performance Share Award\nMetrics\u0094) performance for the Company and the\nPerformance Share Peers for performance year\n2020, for purposes of the settlement of the\n2019 Financial Performance Shares, in a manner\nthat excludes, on a one-timebasis, the initial\nimpact of the Company\u0092s adoption of the\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss standard, a new\naccounting requirement adopted in 2020 by the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board. The\nCompensation Committee and the Independent\nDirectors did not make any adjustments to the\nCompany\u0092s performance associated with the\nperformance shares or other compensation to\nreflect the impacts to the Company\u0092s financial\nperformance as a result of the economic\ndownturn and other effects of the\nCOVID-19pandemic.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  82    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nAdditional Pay Elements As part of the CEO\ncompensation program, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors also approved certain\nother programs intended to support Mr.\nFairbank\u0092s productivity, well-being, and\nsecurity.

Additional details on these\nprograms can be found in the \u0093Named Executive\nOfficer Compensation\u0094 section beginning on\npage 98. 2022 CEO Compensation Program Each\nyear, the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors perform a comprehensive review of\nthe CEO compensation program in consideration\nof Company and CEO performance, peer\ncomparator group performance, historical pay\ninformation, market practices and trends, the\nmarket for talent, stockholder and other\nstakeholder feedback, and other relevant\npoints of information that the Committee and\nIndependent Directors consider appropriate to\nassess the program and CEO compensation level\nand pay design. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors continue to believe that\nthe CEO compensation program aligns Mr.\nFairbank\u0092s compensation with the Company\u0092s\nperformance over the appropriate time\nhorizons, effectively balances risk, and\nsupports the Company\u0092s executive compensation\ngoals and principles. In February 2022, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\nreviewed the 2021 compensation structure\nutilized for Mr. Fairbank and determined that,\nfor 2022, the CEO compensation program would\nbe unchanged and continue to consist of two\ncomponents:\n                                              \n       An Equity or Equity-Based Award.

Mr.\u00a0Fairbank does not      \n       receive a cash base salary.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       A Year-End Incentive Opportunity.      \n       Mr.\u00a0Fairbank will have an opportunity  \n       for a year-end incentive award, with   \n       the amount granted based on CEO and    \n       Company performance in 2022. Any       \n       year-end incentive                     \n       award granted to the CEO (i)\u00a0will      \n       continue to consist primarily of       \n       performance share awards, including    \n       an award of TSR Performance Shares     \n       and Financial Performance Shares,      \n       under which he may receive 0% to 150%  \n       of a target number of shares of        \n       the Company\u0092s common stock based on     \n       the Company\u0092s financial performance     \n       and TSR over a three-year period; and  \n       (ii)\u00a0may also consist of deferred      \n  \u220e    cash, an equity-based award, or both.  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nIn this manner, the CEO\u0092s compensation will\ncontinue to be completely at-riskbased on the\nCompany\u0092s and Mr. Fairbank\u0092s performance, and\nall CEO compensation continues to be subject\nto a three-year deferred vesting or\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            83  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \npayout. As in prior years, Mr. Fairbank will\nnot receive any cash salary in 2022. Any\ndeferred cash or equity-based award will pay\nout or vest after a three-year deferral\nperiod. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors will use their judgment to determine\nwhether to make the year-endincentive award,\nthe form of the award and the value of the\naward. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors will base these determinations on\nthe Committee\u0092s evaluation of the Company\u0092s\nperformance in 2022 relative to the same\nfactors described earlier under \u0093Year-\nEndIncentive Opportunity\u0094 beginning on page\n72, related to financial and operating\nperformance, governance and risk management,\nstrategic performance and winning with our\ncustomers and associates, and Mr. Fairbank\u0092s\ncontribution to that performance. NEO\nCompensation In this section, \u0093NEO\nCompensation,\u0094 the term \u0093NEO\u0094 refers to the\nNEOs other than the CEO. 2021 NEO Compensation\nProgram and Components 2021 NEO Compensation\nProgram The Committee annually reviews and\napproves the form, timing, and amount of\ncompensation for all of our executive\nofficers, including those who are ultimately\nreported as NEOs, and makes recommendations to\nthe Independent Directors for final approval.\nThe Committee takes into account each NEO\u0092s\nhistorical performance, individual roles and\nresponsibilities, contributions expected from\neach NEO in the future as well as the\nrecommendations of the CEO, including his\nassessment of each NEO\u0092s performance. In\nFebruary 2021, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors approved the 2021\ncompensation program, which is designed to be\nconsistent with the Company\u0092s pay-for-\nperformancephilosophy. Based on market\npractices and trends, a review of peer\ncomparator information and in response to\nstockholder feedback, beginning with the 2018\nperformance year, NEO total target\ncompensation is composed of 20% base salary,\n25% cash incentive opportunity, and 55% long-\nterm incentive opportunity, which will consist\nof performance shares and stock-settled RSUs\nas determined by the Committee. The Committee\nbelieves that this pay mix balances\nstockholder interests while effectively\nrewarding and motivating key talent. For the\n2021 performance year, the NEOs (other than\nour former CFO) received a mix of\napproximately 45% cash and 55% equity-based\ncompensation as follows: cash salary,\ndetermined at the beginning of the performance\nyear; and a cash incentive and long-term\nincentive awards, determined following the end\nof the performance year based on the\nCommittee\u0092s evaluation of Company and\nindividual performance during the past year.\nThe long-term incentive awards granted for the\n2021 performance year consisted of performance\nshares (approximately 30% of total target\ncompensation) and stock-settled RSUs\n(generally 25% of total target compensation).\nAll of the equity awards vest over a three-\nyear period. The terms of the performance\nshare awards are substantially similar to the\nterms of the Financial Performance Share\nawards granted to our CEO in 2021, as\ndescribed earlier under \u0093Performance Share\nAwards\u0094 beginning on page 72. The table below\nsummarizes the NEO compensation program that\nthe Committee and the Independent Directors\napproved for the 2021 performance year.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  84    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n2021 NEO Compensation Components The total\ntarget compensation of the NEOs for the 2021\nperformance year was composed of base salary\nawarded at the beginning of the performance\nyear and a year-endincentive opportunity that,\nif granted, may consist of equity awards in\nthe form of performance shares and/or RSUs,\nand a cash incentive.

In 2021, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors approved 2021 cash base\nsalaries for the NEOs ranging from $894,815 to\n$1.22 million, which include subsequent\nadjustments made as a result of an enterprise-\nwide compensation review. Individual details\nfor each NEO are provided in the table below\nshowing compensation by performance year.\nYear-EndIncentive Awards A portion of the\nNEOs\u0092 2021 compensation consisted of an\nopportunity for a year-endincentive award\nbased on Company and the NEO\u0092s individual\nperformance in 2021. This award, if granted,\nmay consist of long-term incentive awards in\nthe form of performance shares and/or RSUs,\nand a cash incentive award. In February 2022,\nthe Committee and the Independent Directors\ndetermined to award each NEO performance\nshares, a cash incentive award, and RSUs as\nrecognition of Company and NEO individual\nperformance in 2021. For purposes of this\nsection, the term \u0093NEOs\u0094 excludes our former\nCFO, who left the Company in March 2021, and,\nas a result, did not receive a year-end\nincentive award for the 2021 performance year.\nCash Incentive Awards The cash incentive\nawards provided to the NEOs are based on the\nCommittee\u0092s evaluation of the Company\u0092s\nperformance during 2021. In February 2021, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\nestablished a target value for the cash\nincentive for each NEO consisting of\napproximately 25% of the NEOs\u0092 total target\ncompensation. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors may determine to award\n0% to 150% of the cash incentive target value\nbased on Company performance. For purposes of\nthe cash incentive awards, the Committee and\nthe Independent Directors assess the Company\u0092s\nperformance based on the Performance Factors.\nThe Committee believes that these factors\nappropriately reflect and balance near-term\nperformance and long-term success for the\nCompany\u0092s customers, associates, and\nstockholders.

Individual details for each NEO are\nprovided in the table below showing\ncompensation by performance year. The\nassessment of Company performance for the NEOs\nis consistent with the assessment performed in\nconnection with the CEO year-endincentive\naward. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors determined that these awards were\nappropriate in light of the Company\u0092s\nperformance as described under \u0093Year-\nEndIncentive Opportunity\u0094 beginning on page 72\nin connection with the determinations by the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\nrelating to the CEO\u0092s year-endincentive\nawards. Long-Term Incentive Awards Long-term\nincentive awards are designed to reward\nindividual performance and align a significant\nportion of compensation with achievement of\nboth annual and long-term performance goals.\nIn determining the actual amounts to be\nawarded to each NEO, the Committee considered\neach NEO\u0092s contribution to the Company\u0092s\nperformance for 2021, as well as the\nindividual performance of each NEO. The\nCommittee also received input from the CEO on\nhis assessment of each NEO\u0092s individual\nperformance and his recommendations for\ncompensation of the NEOs. The CEO also\nassessed the degree to which the NEO balanced\nrisks inherent in the NEO\u0092s role. These\nassessments included the use of both\nquantitative and qualitative risk measures and\nwere compiled by the Chief Risk Officer and\nreviewed by the Chief Human Resources Officer,\nand separately the Chief Audit Officer\ncompiled and reviewed the assessment for the\nChief Risk Officer, before such assessments\nwere presented to the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors for their consideration.\nIn February 2022, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors granted long-term\nincentive awards, consisting of stock-settled\nRSUs and performance shares, to the NEOs,\nother than Mr. Blackley, as recognition for\nindividual NEO performance in 2021 and to\ndrive further long-term performance. The long-\nterm incentive awards granted to these NEOs\nfor performance year 2021 ranged from $2.48\nmillion to $3.89 million. Long-term incentive\nawards are linked to performance in two ways:\n                                              \n       The size of the award is based on      \n  \u220e    each NEO\u0092s individual performance       \n       assessment for the year just           \n       completed                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The ultimate value of the award is     \n  \u220e    dependent on Capital One\u0092s performance  \n       over time                              \n                                              \nThe terms of the performance share awards are\nsubstantially similar to the terms of the\nFinancial Performance Shares awarded to our\nCEO for performance year 2021, as described\nearlier under \u0093Performance Share Award\nMetrics\u0094 beginning on page 73. The NEOs do not\nreceive TSR Performance Shares.

Additional details on these\nprograms can be found in the \u0093Named Executive\nOfficer Compensation\u0094 section beginning on\npage 98. 2022 NEO Compensation Program Each\nyear, the Committee reviews the NEO\ncompensation program in light of Company\nperformance data, peer comparator group\nperformance data, historical pay information,\ndata on specific market practices and trends,\nstockholder feedback, and other relevant\npoints of information. The program consists of\nmultiple compensation vehicles that directly\nlink the NEOs\u0092 compensation with the Company\u0092s\nperformance over multiple time horizons, align\nthe NEOs\u0092 interests with the interests of the\nCompany\u0092s stockholders, support safety and\nsoundness, and encourage appropriate risk-\ntaking. In February 2022, the Committee and\nthe Independent Directors approved the 2022\ncompensation program for our NEOs, which is\nsubstantially similar to the 2021 program.\nAdditional Performance Conditions and Recovery\nProvisions The awards granted to our NEOs\ninclude the following provisions that are\ndesigned to further enhance alignment between\npay and performance and balance the risks that\nour incentive compensation programs might\notherwise encourage:\n                                             \n  \u220e    Performance-based vesting provisions  \n                                             \n                                    \n  \u220e    Performance share reduction  \n                                    \n                                       \n  \u220e    Misconduct clawback provisions  \n                                       \n                                        \n  \u220e    Financial restatement clawbacks  \n                                        \nThese terms and conditions apply to certain\nincentive awards granted to every executive\nofficer and not just to the NEOs.

In addition, the Committee\nnevertheless determined that these awards\nshould be subject to additional performance\nconditions so that the value received by the\nexecutives is also conditioned upon the\nCompany continuing to meet certain operating\nperformance thresholds for each and every\nfiscal year ending in the three-year vesting\nperiod. Any forfeitures will be cumulative\nover the three-year vesting period. In this\nmanner, regardless of our executives\u0092 past\nperformance and our stock price performance,\nthe awards subject to performance-based\nvesting remain at risk of complete forfeiture\nover the three-year vesting period.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  90    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nPerformance-based vesting provisions apply to\nthe following awards:\n                                    \n  \u220e    All NEO stock option awards  \n                                    \n                                   \n  \u220e    All NEO stock-settled RSUs  \n                                   \n                                  \n  \u220e    All CEO cash-settled RSUs  \n                                  \nThese performance conditions do not present\nany upside potential for the NEOs\u0092\ncompensation but instead create an additional\nat-riskelement to the compensation that has\nbeen awarded to them. Imposing these\nadditional performance conditions is designed\nto further reflect our approach of balancing\nrisk and performance over the long term. For\nawards granted since January 2014, vesting is\nconditioned on the Company achieving positive\nCore Earnings (as defined below). If Core\nEarnings are not positive for any fiscal year\nin the vesting period, the named executive\nofficer will automatically forfeit 50% of one\nyear\u0092s worth of vesting (i.e., one-sixthof the\ntotal award). In addition, the Committee will\ndetermine the extent to which any named\nexecutive officer was accountable for the\noutcome and, based on such determination, the\nCommittee will decide whether any or all of\nthe remaining 50% of one year\u0092s worth of\nvesting will also be forfeited. The Committee\nmay also decide to delay the vesting of the\napplicable portion of the award not so\nforfeited. For the NEOs, these determinations\nwill be made each year prior to the scheduled\nvesting date, based on the Core Earnings for\nthe fiscal year ended prior to such vesting\ndate. For the CEO, these determinations will\nbe made prior to the scheduled vesting date at\nthe end of the three-year vesting period,\ntaking into account Core Earnings for each\nfiscal year within the period. Core Earnings\nfocuses on whether profits are being generated\nby our basic business, as opposed to other\nfactors that may not reflect business\nfundamentals. The applicable award agreements\ndefine \u0093Core Earnings\u0094 to mean the Company\u0092s\nnet income available to common stockholders,\nexcluding, on a tax-adjustedbasis, the impact\nof (i) impairment or amortization of goodwill\nand intangible assets, and (ii) the build or\nrelease of the allowance for credit losses,\ncalculated as the difference between the\nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs,\nnet of recoveries. The Committee believes that\nCore Earnings is an appropriate performance\nmetric to employ for these performance-based\nvesting provisions because the metric captures\nmajor operational costs and risks to the\nCompany\u0092s business, including charge-offs,\noperating expenses, market and competitive\nrisks, and costs to maintain adequate levels\nof capital and liquidity. Because the metric\nis based on net income available to common\nstockholders, it also includes the impact of\ndiscontinued operations.

These reductions will\noccur regardless of how well the Company\u0092s\nAdjusted ROTCE compares to the Performance\nShare Peers. If the Company does not achieve\npositive Adjusted ROTCE for one year in the\nperformance period, the total number of shares\nissued on the vesting date will be reduced by\none-sixth.If the Company does not achieve\npositive Adjusted ROTCE for two years in the\nperformance period, the total number of shares\nissued on the vesting date will be reduced by\none-third.If the Company does not achieve\npositive Adjusted ROTCE for any of the three\nyears in the performance period, the NEOs will\nforfeit the entire award.

If an executive would\nhave been entitled to fewer shares on the\nvesting date under the restated financial\nstatements, the executive may be required to\nreturn to the Company the excess shares\nawarded to him or her or, in the event he or\nshe has sold or otherwise transferred the\nshares, he or she may be required to return\nthe net proceeds from the sale or transfer.\nProcess and Criteria for Compensation\nDecisions The Committee considers a number of\nfactors in making compensation decisions with\nrespect to the NEOs. The Committee relies on a\nrange of objective data including Company\nperformance data, peer comparator group\nperformance data, historical pay information,\ndata on specific market practices and trends,\nstockholder feedback, and other relevant\npoints of information to inform its business\njudgment. Use of Outside Consultants for NEO\nCompensation The Committee engages FW Cook to\nassist in the design of the CEO compensation\nprogram. FW Cook assists the Committee in a\nnumber of ways, including proposing and\nevaluating a peer comparator group, gathering\nrelevant compensation data from the peer\ngroup, and discussing relevant market trends\nand context and developing recommendations on\npossible plan designs. The Chief Human\nResources Officer and other members of the\nCompany\u0092s Human Resources department assist\nthe CEO in developing compensation\nrecommendations for the NEOs other than the\nCEO for the Committee\u0092s consideration. The\nHuman Resources department typically uses\nmultiple surveys as sources of market\ncompensation data. FW Cook also provides\nadditional market reference points that the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors use\nwhen evaluating NEO compensation, and other\noutside consultants provide information to the\nHuman Resources department regarding market\npractices, trends, and research reports. The\nHuman Resources department is responsible for\nanalyzing the information obtained from the\noutside consultants and presenting it to the\nCEO, who considers the information and makes\nhis compensation recommendations for the NEOs\nto the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  92    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nA consultant from FW Cook is present at\nCommittee meetings during which CEO and NEO\ncompensation is discussed and provides market\ndata as well as an independent perspective\nregarding CEO and NEO compensation practices.\nFW Cook has no other engagement with, and\nperforms no other services for, Capital One\nother than the services described above.

Peer\nGroups Peer Group to Determine Level and\nComponents of Compensation In order to\nattract, retain, and motivate top executive\ntalent and non-employeedirectors consistent\nwith our compensation program objectives, the\nCommittee reviews data annually from a group\nof peer companies that are similar in size,\nbusiness, and industry to the Company. These\norganizations are intended to represent the\nmarketplace of companies with which Capital\nOne competes for business and for executive\ntalent. The compensation data from the peer\ngroup is used to inform the Committee\u0092s\ndetermination of the structure and the total\ncompensation target values of the compensation\nprogram for the NEOs other than the CEO and\nthe total level of compensation for the CEO.\nThe peer group is reviewed each year and\nadjusted, as appropriate, so that the peer\ngroup companies reflect Capital One\u0092s\ncompetitive environment. The Committee\nexamines pay practices and data for the peer\ngroup companies as a source of benchmarking\ndata to assess the competitiveness of our\ncompensation levels and pay components. As\npart of this analysis, a consultant from FW\nCook presents a comprehensive report to the\nCommittee that highlights the size, scope, and\nperformance information from the peer\ncompanies across a variety of metrics and\npresents recommendations for changes to the\npeer group, as applicable. The Committee\nspecifically considers the Company\u0092s\npercentile rank versus peer comparator\ncompanies across the following financial\nmetrics:\n                                              \n  \u220e\u2002Revenue                                   \n  \u220e\u2002Assets              \u220e\u2002Adjusted ROA        \n  \u220e\u2002Market value        \u220e\u2002Tier 1 common       \n  \u220e\u2002Net income          capital ratio         \n  available to          \u220e\u2002Charge-off rate     \n  common                \u220e\u2002Ratio of stock      \n  stockholders          price to tangible     \n  \u220e\u2002U.S. deposits       book value            \n  \u220e\u2002Loans held for      \u220e\u2002Ratio of stock      \n  investment            price to earnings \u00a0   \n  \u220e\u2002Diluted EPS         \u220e\u2002TSR                 \n  growth                                      \n                                              \nAfter reviewing this information, the\nCommittee recommends a final peer comparator\ngroup to the Independent Directors for\napproval. The peer comparator group is\nreviewed each year and adjusted, as\nappropriate, so that the size, scope,\nperformance, and business focus of the peer\ncomparator companies (i) reflect Capital One\u0092s\ncompetitive environment, (ii) mitigate market\ndata volatility, (iii) recognize the Company\u0092s\nfocus on technological innovations in the\nbanking industry, and (iv) position the\nCompany near the median with regard to the\nsize of the companies in the group. For 2021,\nthe peer comparator group was the same group\nas 2020 and included the following companies:\n                                              \n  \u220e\u2002Ally         \u220e\u2002Goldman      \u220e\u2002Regions     \n  Financial      Sachs          Financial     \n                 Group                        \n  \u220e\u2002American     \u220e\u2002J.P.         \u220e\u2002Synchrony   \n  Express        Morgan         Financial     \n                 Chase                        \n  \u220e\u2002Bank of      \u220e\u2002             \u220e\u2002Truist      \n  America        Mastercard     Financial     \n  Corporation                                 \n  \u220e\u2002Citigroup    \u220e\u2002Morgan       \u220e\u2002U.S.        \n                 Stanley        Bancorp       \n  \u220e\u2002Discover                                  \n  Financial      \u220e\u2002PayPal       \u220e\u2002Visa        \n  Services                                    \n  \u220e\u2002Fifth        \u220e\u2002PNC          \u220e\u2002Wells       \n  Third          Financial      Fargo\u00a0&       \n  Bancorp        Services       Company       \n                                              \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            93  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nThe Committee and the Independent Directors\nbelieve that this peer group reflects the\ncompetitive environment for the Company,\nparticularly the performance and business\nfocus of the companies in the peer group and\nthe competition for executive talent. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, Capital One was positioned\nat or near the median of the peer comparator\ngroup in terms of total assets, loans,\ndeposits, revenues, and net income. Peer Group\nto Determine Settlement of Performance Share\nAwards For both the Financial Performance\nShares and the TSR Performance Shares, the\nCompany\u0092s performance on each metric is\nassessed over the three-year period relative\nto the Performance Share Peers. See\n\u0093Performance Share Award Peer Group\u0094 on page\n74 for additional information. Tally Sheets In\naddition to considering market data from our\npeer comparator group (when available), the\nCommittee also conducts an annual\ncomprehensive review of tally sheets for the\nCEO and each NEO which reflect all components\nof compensation and include total compensation\nand potential payouts. Each tally sheet\nsummarizes multiple components of current and\nhistorical compensation. The tally sheets\nassist with the Committee\u0092s understanding of\nthe historical context that is relevant to\ncurrent compensation decisions, such as the\nCEO and each NEO\u0092s unrealized equity value.\nOther Compensation Arrangements Pension and\nNon-QualifiedDeferred Compensation Plans\nCapital One does not have any active pension\nplans for the NEOs. In 2021, each of our NEOs\nparticipated in Capital One\u0092s VNQDCP, which is\na voluntary, non-qualifieddeferred\ncompensation plan that restores participating\nNEOs, excluding the CEO, to the level of\nsavings they would have achieved if they had\nnot been impacted by Internal Revenue Service\nlimits governing our qualified 401(k) plan. It\nalso allows the NEOs, excluding the CEO, to\ndefer additional pre-taxcompensation in order\nto save for retirement. The CEO participates\nin the VNQDCP on a non-voluntarybasis, as the\ndeferred cash portion of his year-endincentive\nis mandatorily deferred in the VNQDCP for\nthree years. Capital One periodically reviews\npension and other deferred compensation\nprograms and practices at our peer comparator\ncompanies and across the financial services\nindustry. We also review changes in the legal\nand regulatory environment pertaining to\nretirement programs. Details of the VNQDCP can\nbe found under \u0093Capital One\u0092s Voluntary Non-\nQualifiedDeferred Compensation Programs\u0094\nbeginning on page 106. Employment Agreements\nCapital One typically does not enter into\ndefined term employment agreements with the\nNEOs in order to maintain maximum flexibility\nin establishing separation terms at the\nappropriate time and considering their current\ncircumstances. The Committee retains full\ndiscretion to approve employment agreements on\nan exception basis and has done so for\nexceptional circumstances in the past. None of\nthe current NEOs have an employment agreement.\nChange of Control Agreements Each NEO\ncurrently employed by the Company is a party\nto an agreement providing certain benefits if\nthe executive\u0092s employment terminates in\nconnection with a change of control, as well\nas compensation and benefits protections\nduring the two-yearperiod following the change\nof control.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  94    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nThe change of control agreements define\ncompensation and benefits payable to NEOs in\ncertain merger and acquisition scenarios. The\nCommittee believes these agreements provide\nthe NEOs with some certainty and allow the\nNEOs to remain neutral and consider a full\nrange of strategic decisions that are focused\non maximizing stockholder value. The change of\ncontrol agreements are also intended to allow\nCapital One\u0092s businesses to operate with\nminimal disruption in the event of a change of\ncontrol by providing each NEO with an\nincentive to remain in his or her leadership\nrole up to and beyond the transaction date. In\naddition to compensation and benefits\nprotections during a two-yearprotection period\nafter a change of control, the NEOs are\nentitled to severance benefits under the\nagreements if their employment is actually\nterminated as a result of (or in anticipation\nof) certain merger and acquisition scenarios.\nBoth eligibility for participation and the\nstructure of payments under these agreements\nare designed to be aligned with market\npractice in the banking and financial services\nindustry. Our program is designed so that our\nstockholders are not faced with\ndisproportionate severance costs that may\nimpair potential merger opportunities. In\naddition, our change of control agreements for\nexecutive officers do not provide for excise\ntax \u0093gross-up\u0094payments. Projections of\npotential payouts to the NEOs under these\nagreements are included in the total\ncompensation tally sheets reviewed by the\nCommittee on an annual basis. Although the\npotential change of control payouts do not\nnecessarily impact annual decisions on NEO\npay, reviewing this information allows the\nCommittee to fully understand the downstream\nimplications of its decisions and the\nresulting impact to the Company and its\nstockholders. Additional details regarding\nthese agreements can be found under \u0093Payments\nUnder Certain Termination Scenarios\u0094 beginning\non page 109. Post-Employment Compensation\nPractices The CEO has no employment or\nseverance arrangement with the Company other\nthan the change of control agreement as\ndescribed above. If an NEO, excluding the CEO,\nseparates from Capital One, he or she is\nentitled to receive the amounts set forth in\nthe Company\u0092s Executive Severance Plan, which\nprovides for a payment of up to 30% of the\nNEO\u0092s then-current total target compensation\nplus a pro-ratedseverance bonus based on the\nNEO\u0092s target cash incentive in the event of\ninvoluntary termination without cause due to\nrestructuring. Additional benefits include\npartially subsidized health, dental, and\nvision benefits for a period of up to 18\nmonths through COBRA, and term life\ncontinuation and outplacement services for a\nperiod of up to one year following separation.\nThe Committee may exercise its discretion in\napproving additional amounts in light of all\nrelevant circumstances, including the NEO\u0092s\nterm of employment, past accomplishments,\nreasons for separation from the Company,\npotential risks and the NEO\u0092s willingness to\nrestrict his or her future action(s), such as\nthrough an agreement not to compete or solicit\nthe Company\u0092s customers or associates. In\naddition, following a separation from Capital\nOne, certain equity-based awards will continue\nto vest according to their original terms, as\ndescribed under \u0093Payments Under Certain\nTermination Scenarios\u0094 beginning on page 109.\nCapital One has entered into agreements with\ncertain NEOs that contain restrictive\ncovenants related to confidentiality, non-\ncompetition, non-solicitation,and ownership of\nwork product. For additional information, see\n\u0093Restrictive Covenants\u0094 beginning on page 108.\nUpon retiring from the Company, associates,\nincluding the NEOs, are generally entitled to\nreceive certain retiree medical benefits,\nincluding subsidized medical benefits for\nqualified individuals. In addition, certain\nequity-based awards will continue to vest\naccording to their original terms, as\ndescribed under \u0093Payments Upon Retirement\u0094 on\npage 110.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            95  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nOther Aspects of Executive Compensation Stock\nOwnership and Retention Requirements\nConsistent with their responsibilities to our\nstockholders, the executive officers are\nrequired to maintain a significant financial\nstake in the Company. To this end, the CEO and\nthe other NEOs must own shares of Capital One\nstock with a fair market value of at least the\nfollowing (\u0093Stock Ownership Requirement\u0094):\n                                              \n                 Ownership\u00a0     Post-Termin\u2026  \n  Role           Requirement    Ownership\u00a0    \n                                Requirement   \n  CEO            $10.5\u00a0         $5.25\u00a0        \n                 million        million       \n  Other\u00a0NEOs\u00a0                                 \n  and\u00a0           3x\u00a0annual\u00a0     1.5x\u00a0annual\u00a0  \n  Executive\u00a0     cash\u00a0salary    cash\u00a0salary   \n  Officers                                    \n                                              \nGiven that the CEO\u0092s compensation program does\nnot include a base salary, his Stock Ownership\nRequirement is based on an amount established\nannually by the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors. Beginning in 2020, the CEO\u0092s Stock\nOwnership Requirement was increased to an\namount equal to six multiplied by $1.75\nmillion, or $10.5 million. In addition, the\nCEO and all other NEOs are required to\ncontinue to hold 50% of their Stock Ownership\nRequirement for one year following\ntermination, retirement, or ceasing to serve\nas an executive officer, except in case of\ntermination by death, disability, or in\nconnection with a change of control. The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\nbelieve that these stock ownership\nrequirements have increased the alignment of\nCEO and all other NEO compensation with\nstockholder interests.

New\nexecutive officers are given five years from\nthe date of promotion to or appointment as an\nexecutive officer to comply with the Stock\nOwnership Requirements. In the event that an\nexecutive officer is not in compliance with\nthese requirements, the Committee has the\nright to take action, including reducing the\nexecutive officer\u0092s compensation. The CEO and\nall other NEOs are currently in compliance\nwith this requirement. The Company has stock\nretention requirements for certain equity\nawards made to the CEO and the other NEOs.\nWith respect to awards of performance shares\nand stock-settled RSUs that vest (i) during an\nexecutive\u0092s term of employment with Capital\nOne, or (ii) as applicable, prior to the first\nanniversary of such executive\u0092s separation\nfrom Capital One, each executive must hold 50%\nof the after-taxnet shares acquired (\u0093Retained\nShares\u0094) for a period of one year after the\nacquisition date of the shares. In addition,\nfor performance shares and stock-settled RSUs\ngranted after January 2021, the Company\nrequires that Retained Shares continue to be\nheld beyond the one-yearperiod until the CEO\nand the other NEOs\u0092 Stock Ownership\nRequirement, as described above, is met. These\nstock ownership and retention requirements\napply to all of our executive officers.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  96    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nProhibition of Hedging, Speculative Trading\nActivities, and Pledging As part of the\ncommitment by Capital One\u0092s leadership team to\nmaintain public confidence in the long-term\ngrowth of Capital One\u0092s stock, Capital One\nmaintains a policy prohibiting hedging and\nspeculative trading activities. Specifically,\nthe policy prohibits certain individuals from\nengaging in short sales, hedging transactions,\nor speculative trading in derivative\nsecurities of Capital One stock. The policy\napplies to all Capital One directors, officers\n(as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange\nAct), and together with Capital One directors,\n\u0093Control Group Members\u0094), and associates who\n(i) serve at the Senior Vice President level\nor above, (ii) report directly to a Control\nGroup Member, or (iii) are otherwise\ndetermined by Capital One\u0092s General Counsel to\nbe an \u0093insider.\u0094 The policy applies to all\nshares of Capital One stock held by those\npersons covered by the policy, regardless of\nwhether the stock was granted as compensation\nby Capital One or is otherwise held directly\nor indirectly. Capital One also prohibits its\nControl Group Members from using Capital One\nsecurities, including common stock, in a\nmargin account or pledging Capital One\nsecurities as collateral for a loan. Equity\nGrant Practices Capital One strives to\nmaintain equity grant practices that\ndemonstrate high standards of corporate\ngovernance. Annual incentive awards generally\nare approved by the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors (or by authority\ndelegated to the Chief Human Resources Officer\nfor certain associates who are not executive\nofficers) at regularly scheduled meetings in\nthe first quarter of each year. The date of\ngrant is the actual date on which the\nCommittee approves the awards. The Committee\nmay grant awards of restricted stock, RSUs,\nstock options, or other equity awards outside\nof the annual incentive cycle. The Committee\nhas delegated authority to the CEO to award\nrestricted stock and to the Chief Human\nResources Officer to award stock-settled and\ncash-settled RSUs (but not options or other\nequity awards) to associates who are not\nexecutive officers, subject to a maximum\namount of $2 million for any associate in any\none year with an aggregate $50 million annual\nlimit. These awards are designed to be used\nfor new hires and for special programs\ndesigned by management to incentivize, retain,\nand reward current associates of the Company.\nThe Committee reviews all grants made by\ndelegation at least once per year. With\nrespect to awards of stock options, the\nexercise price is always the Fair Market Value\nof the Company\u0092s stock on the date of grant.\nUnder the terms of our 2004 Stock Incentive\nPlan, \u0093Fair Market Value\u0094 is equal to the\nclosing price of the Company\u0092s common stock on\nthe date of grant. The Company does not seek\nto time equity grants to take advantage of\nmaterial non-publicinformation, and in no\nevent is the grant date set to a date that is\nprior to the date of approval. Tax\nConsiderations The Committee carefully\nconsiders the tax impacts of its compensation\nprograms on the Company, as well as on its\nexecutives. To maintain flexibility in\ncompensating executive officers, the Committee\ndoes not require all compensation to be paid\nor awarded in a tax-deductiblemanner. However,\nit has been the Committee\u0092s intent to maximize\ntax deductibility to the extent reasonable and\nconsistent with the Company\u0092s overall\nexecutive compensation objectives. Prior to\nthe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of\n2017 (the \u0093TCJA\u0094), Section 162(m) of the IRC\nexempted \u0093qualified performance-based\ncompensation\u0094 from the deduction disallowance\ngenerally required by Section 162(m). The TCJA\nrepealed this exemption, such that most forms\nof performance-based compensation paid to\ncovered executive officers in excess of $1\nmillion will not be deductible going forward,\nwith certain exceptions. The Committee\nreserves the right to modify compensation that\nwas initially intended to be exempt from\nSection 162(m) if it determines that such\nmodifications are consistent with Capital\nOne\u0092s business needs.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            97  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection VI - Named Executive Officer\nCompensation 2021 Summary Compensation Table\nThe Summary Compensation Table below provides\ninformation about compensation for the fiscal\nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nfor the NEOs.

Prior to\nNovember 1995, Capital One offered a Cash\nBalance Pension Plan (\u0093CBPP\u0094) and an Excess\nCash Balance Plan (\u0093Excess CBPP\u0094) to all full-\ntime salaried associates and certain executive\nofficers. Both of these programs were frozen\nin December 1995; however, interest continues\nto accrue on plan balances on a quarterly\nbasis for the CBPP and on a monthly basis for\nthe Excess CBPP. The CBPP interest rate\nchanges annually, based on the average yield\nof five-year U.S. Treasury Securities for the\nmonth of October of the prior plan year (0.36%\nfor 2021). The Excess CBPP interest rate\nchanges monthly based on the Wall Street\nJournal Prime Rate (3.30% annual average for\n2021). Messrs. Fairbank and Wassmer\nparticipated in these programs. The estimated\nannual payouts upon retirement in the CBPP and\nthe Excess CBPP as of December 31, 2021, are\n$2,578.92 and $9,266.64, respectively, for Mr.\nFairbank, and $581.40 and $0, respectively,\nfor Mr. Wassmer. As of December 31, 2021, the\n\u0093Present Value of Accumulated Benefit\u0094 for Mr.\nFairbank for both plans is equal to his\naccount balance because Mr. Fairbank has\nattained the normal retirement age of 65 and\nso is assumed to retire immediately under the\nactuarial valuation assumptions. Since Mr.\nFairbank is assumed to retire as of the\nmeasurement date, the future interest rate\ndoes not apply. Because Mr. Wassmer has not\nyet attained age 65, the future interest rate\nwas applied to his \u0093Present Value of\nAccumulated Benefit\u0094 calculation. The account\nin each plan is distributed after any\nseparation from service. Distribution options\nfrom the CBPP plan are lump sum (eligible for\nrollover to another qualified plan or personal\nIRA) or an annuity option.

The\nCommittee reviews each executive officer\u0092s\nseparation on a case-by-casebasis and\nexercises its business judgment, with the\napproval of the Independent Directors, to\ncustomize the terms of such separations in\nconsideration of the relevant circumstances,\nincluding:\n                                       \n  \u220e    The reasons for the separation  \n                                       \n                                              \n  \u220e    Market competitive practices for       \n       comparable separation scenarios        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Potential benefits to the Company,     \n       such as retaining its competitive      \n       advantage, maintaining a positive      \n  \u220e    reputation                             \n       internally and externally, and         \n       preserving its ability to recruit      \n       highly talented executives             \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The executive\u0092s tenure and              \n       contributions to the Company\u0092s success  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The executive\u0092s willingness to provide  \n       legal waivers and/or enter into        \n  \u220e    agreements not to compete with the     \n       Company                                \n       or to solicit the Company\u0092s associates  \n       or customers                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       The resulting impact of the            \n  \u220e    separation terms on the Company and    \n       its stockholders                       \n                                              \nRestrictive Covenants Capital One maintains a\ncompetitive advantage in part through the\nintellectual property developed and utilized\nby our senior executives. Capital One has\nasked certain NEOs to enter into various\nagreements that contain restrictive covenants\nrelated to confidentiality, non-competition,\nnon-solicitation,and ownership of work\nproduct, as described below. Non-\nCompetitionAgreements Messrs. Blackley,\nWassmer, Yajnik, and Young have entered into\nnon-competitionagreements with the Company\npursuant to which they may be restricted as to\nwhat competitive services they may provide to\nan entity following separation from Capital\nOne. Messrs. Yajnik and Young have entered\ninto non-competitionagreements with the\nCompany which provide for the following in\nexchange for the NEO complying with non-\ncompetitionrestrictions for up to two years\nfollowing an involuntary termination, other\nthan for cause, death, or disability: payment\nequal to 15% of the NEO\u0092s total target\ncompensation for each year of enforcement and\nup to 18 months of subsidized health insurance\npremiums under COBRA if the NEO is eligible\nand elects such coverage, subject to certain\nterms and conditions. The payments are made in\ntwo lump sums: the first following termination\nand the second upon successful completion of\nthe enforcement period. In the event of a\nvoluntary termination, the previously\ndescribed payments are typically made for the\nsecond year of enforcement only for agreements\nwith a two-yearenforcement period.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  108    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nMr. Wassmer has entered into a non-\ncompetitionagreement with the Company that\nestablishes non-competitionrestrictions for up\nto two years following an involuntary\ntermination without cause, and up to five\nyears following a voluntary termination or an\ninvoluntary termination with cause.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, any non-\ncompetitionrestrictions that apply in Canada\nor the United Kingdom are limited to one year\nafter termination. The non-\ncompetitionagreement provides that, subject to\nits terms, Mr. Wassmer will receive: payment\nequal to 15% of his total target compensation\nfor each eligible year of the first and second\nyears of his non-competitionperiod; payment\nequal to 20% of his total target compensation\nfor each eligible year of the third through\nfifth years of his non-competitionperiod; and\nup to 18 months of subsidized health insurance\npremiums under COBRA if he is eligible and\nelects such coverage, subject to certain terms\nand conditions. In the event of a termination\nof employment by Capital One for any reason\nother than death, disability, or cause, the\nnon-competepayments for the first two years\nare made in two lump sums, the first following\ntermination and the second upon successful\ncompletion of the second year. Further, in\nsuch scenario, any additional payments for any\neligible year of the third through fifth years\nof the non-competitionperiod would be paid\nafter successful completion for each of those\nyears, respectively. In the event of a\nvoluntary termination of employment, Mr.\nWassmer would be eligible for payments only\nfor the second through fifth years of his non-\ncompetitionperiod. There are no payments under\nthe non-competitionagreements if benefits are\npayable under a change of control agreement.\nSee \u0093Change of Control\u0094 below for information\nregarding Change of Control Agreements\napplicable to the NEOs. In addition, payments\nrelated to the non-competitionagreement are\nseparate from any severance payments that may\nbe made upon the NEO\u0092s departure. However,\nseverance payments are typically offset in\npart by payments related to the non-\ncompetitionagreement so that total payment\namounts are consistent with the severance\nprogram\u0092s intent. For Mr. Wassmer, only the\npayments for years one and two of his non-\ncompetitionperiod offset any amounts payable\nto him under any severance plan or\narrangement. Confidentiality, Work Product,\nand Non-Solicitationof Employee Agreement\nMessrs. Blackley, Wassmer, Yajnik, and Young\nare parties to confidentiality, work product,\nand non-solicitationof employee agreements.\nThe confidentiality provisions of these\nagreements generally provide that at all times\nduring and following employment with the\nCompany, these NEOs may not use for personal\nbenefit or the benefit of others, or divulge\nto others, any of Capital One\u0092s confidential\ninformation, except as expressly authorized by\nCapital One or required by legal process.\nThese agreements also provide that for a\nperiod of two years following separation from\nCapital One, these NEOs shall not directly or\nindirectly solicit or induce any associate of\nCapital One to become employed by any person\nor entity engaged in competition with Capital\nOne, and shall not directly or indirectly\nsolicit or induce any associate of Capital One\nto end his or her employment based on\nconfidential information these NEOs learned\nabout the associate while they were employed\nby Capital One. Payments Under Certain\nTermination Scenarios Upon separation from the\nCompany, the NEOs, regardless of the reason\nfor termination, receive certain earned, but\npreviously unpaid, payments, such as accrued\nbut unused vacation pay and amounts earned and\nvested under the Company\u0092s qualified and non-\nqualifiedretirement programs. In addition,\ncash-settled RSUs granted to NEOs, other than\nthe CEO, after the end of a performance year\ncontinue to vest according to the original\nprovisions of such grants upon separation for\nany reason other than cause or as soon as\npracticable following a \u0093double trigger\u0094\nchange of control (as discussed below).\nVoluntary Termination An NEO, other than the\nCEO, who voluntarily terminates employment\nwith Capital One may receive payments related\nto non-competitioncovenants (described above,\nif applicable) and any contractual payments to\nwhich the NEO may otherwise be entitled. In\naddition, the NEO has the ability following\nseparation to exercise vested but unexercised\noptions for three months following voluntary\ntermination.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           109  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nInvoluntary Termination Without Cause An NEO,\nother than the CEO, whose employment with\nCapital One is terminated involuntarily, for\nperformance or job elimination, is entitled to\nreceive the amounts set forth in the Company\u0092s\nExecutive Severance Plan in exchange for\nexecuting a release of claims against the\nCompany. For 2021, potential payments under\nthe Executive Severance Plan were 30% of total\ntarget compensation, plus a severance bonus\nbased on such NEO\u0092s target cash incentive in\nthe event of termination due to restructuring.\nAdditional benefits include healthcare\ncontinuation subsidy under COBRA, continued\ncoverage through broad-based and executive\nlife insurance programs, outplacement\nservices, and any contractual payments to\nwhich the NEO may otherwise have been\nentitled. If an NEO\u0092s Non-CompetitionAgreement\nis enforced, cash payments under the Executive\nSeverance Plan, other than the severance\nbonus, will be offset by any cash amounts paid\nunder their respective Non-\nCompetitionAgreement, and the NEO will be\neligible for an additional payment of up to\n90% of the severance payments in exchange for\nexecuting a release of claims against the\nCompany. Generally, performance shares granted\nto NEOs will vest in full, based on actual\nCompany performance, subject to the NEO\u0092s\nexecution of a release of claims against the\nCompany. Stock-settled RSUs granted to NEOs\nwill continue to vest if an involuntary\ntermination without cause occurs, subject to\nthe NEO\u0092s execution of a release of claims\nagainst the Company. In addition, NEOs have\nthe ability following separation to exercise\nvested but unexercised options for two years.\nIf a NEO\u0092s employment with Capital One is\nterminated as a result of death or disability,\nthe NEO\u0092s unvested RSUs and performance shares\nwill vest in full based on target Company\nperformance. Payments Upon Retirement As with\nall executives who are eligible for\nretirement, NEOs who retire from Capital One\nmay receive the following amounts: payments\nrelated to non-competitioncovenants as if they\nhad terminated voluntarily (described above);\ncoverage through the executive life insurance\nprogram (at a reduced benefit); any\ncontractual payments to which he or she may\notherwise be entitled; and, for Messrs.\nFairbank and Yajnik, who became eligible to\nretire on or before December 31, 2012,\npartially subsidized participation in retiree\nmedical coverage (including dependents as\napplicable). Upon retirement, all RSUs\ncontinue to vest according to their original\nterms based on actual performance, which, for\nstock-settled RSUs granted during or after\n2012, also includes performance-based vesting\nprovisions. In addition, performance shares\ngranted to NEOs will continue to vest after\nretirement. For stock options, the executive\nhas until the expiration of the option term to\nexercise vested but unexercised options.\nTermination for Cause Generally, an NEO whose\nemployment with Capital One is terminated for\ncause receives no additional benefits but is\nrequired to comply with any applicable\nrestrictive covenants related to\nconfidentiality, non-competition, non-\nsolicitationof associates or customers, and\nownership of work product, as described above.\nIn addition, if terminated for cause, the NEOs\nhave the ability following separation to\nexercise vested but unexercised options for\nthree months. Change of Control Each NEO is a\nparty to an agreement (a \u0093Change of Control\nAgreement\u0094) that provides for certain payments\nin the event his or her employment is\nterminated within two years following (or\nwithin one year prior to but in anticipation\nof) a change of control of Capital One, either\ninvoluntarily without cause or voluntarily for\ngood reason. Amounts payable in each of these\nscenarios are outlined below. Pursuant to the\nagreements, a \u0093change of control\u0094 occurs if\none or more of the following events take\nplace: (i) an acquisition of 20% or more of\nCapital One\u0092s common stock or the combined\nvoting power of the voting securities of\nCapital One by a person or group, (ii) certain\nchanges in the majority of the Board, (iii)\nconsummation of a\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  110    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nreorganization, merger, share exchange or\nconsolidation or similar transaction, sale of\nall assets or the acquisition of another\ncompany, except where all or substantially all\nof Capital One\u0092s stockholders receive 50% or\nmore of the stock of the resulting company, at\nleast a majority of the board of directors of\nthe resulting company were incumbent Board\nmembers, and no person owns 20% or more of the\nresulting company who did not own such stock\nimmediately before the business combination,\nor (iv) approval by stockholders of a complete\nliquidation or dissolution of Capital One. In\nthe event of a change of control, we do not\nprovide for excise tax gross-uppayments. In\naddition, all equity awards granted to the\nNEOs require a so-called\u0093double trigger\u0094 for\naccelerated vesting in connection with a\nchange of control. Upon a change of control,\nall equity awards continue to vest according\nto their original schedule. The vesting of\nsuch awards only accelerates if a named\nexecutive officer is involuntarily terminated\nwithout cause or voluntarily terminates for\ngood reason within the two years following a\nchange of control. Termination for Cause in\nConnection with a Change of Control NEOs\nterminated involuntarily for cause following a\nchange of control receive no additional\nbenefits except with regard to options, which\nallow NEOs to exercise vested but unexercised\noptions for three months following a\ntermination for cause. Voluntary Termination\nwith Good Reason or Involuntary Termination\nWithout Cause in Connection with a Change of\nControl In the event of a voluntary\ntermination with good reason or an involuntary\ntermination without cause, the potential\npayments that the NEOs could receive under\ncertain termination scenarios are based on a\npercentage of total target compensation.

Fairbank.\nFor 2021, our last completed fiscal year:\n                                              \n  \u220e    The Annual Total Compensation of our   \n       median employee was $81,029            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The Annual Total Compensation of Mr.\u00a0  \n       Fairbank was $20,457,553               \n                                              \nAccordingly, the ratio of Mr. Fairbank\u0092s\nAnnual Total Compensation to the median\nemployee\u0092s Annual Total Compensation was 252\nto 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate\ncalculated in a manner consistent with Item\n402(u) of Regulation S-K. In determining our\nmedian employee for 2021, in accordance with\nSEC rules we have concluded that it would be\nappropriate to: (i) rely on the process we\nundertook in 2020 to identify the median\nemployee (as described in our 2021 Proxy\nStatement), because we believe that since the\n2020 determination, there has been no change\nin our employee population or employee\ncompensation arrangements that would\nsignificantly impact our pay ratio; and (ii)\nsubstitute the median employee for 2020 with\nanother similarly compensated employee for\n2021 because the 2020 median employee was\npromoted in July 2021. We determined the 2020\nmedian compensated employee of our global\nemployee population of 52,781 as of October 1,\n2020 (the \u0093Determination Date\u0094) by comparing a\nconsistently applied compensation measure\nconsisting of salary, wages (including\novertime), bonuses and commissions paid to our\nemployees over the twelve-month period\npreceding the Determination Date (the\n\u0093Estimated Compensation\u0094). Based on the\nEstimated Compensation of each employee, we\nidentified a cohort of 61 employees consisting\nof the employee with the median Estimated\nCompensation value and the 30 employees above\nand 30 employees below that employee (\u0093The\nMedian Cohort\u0094).\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           113  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nWe then removed 11 employees from the Median\nCohort who appeared to bear anomalous\ncharacteristics (such as participation in\nnon-U.S.compensation programs, a hire date\nduring the fiscal year, or separation prior to\nthe end of the fiscal year) that could\nsignificantly distort the pay ratio\ncalculation, and then identified the median\nemployee from the remaining employees in the\nMedian Cohort. The SEC\u0092s rules for identifying\nthe median compensated employee and\ncalculating the pay ratio based on that\nemployee\u0092s Annual Total Compensation allow\ncompanies to adopt a variety of methodologies,\nto apply certain exclusions, and to make\nreasonable estimates and assumptions that\nreflect their employee populations and\ncompensation practices. As a result, the pay\nratio reported by other companies may not be\ncomparable to the pay ratio reported above, as\nother companies have different employee\npopulations and compensation practices and may\nutilize different methodologies, exclusions,\nestimates, and assumptions in calculating\ntheir own pay ratios.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  114    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection VII - Equity Compensation Plans Equity\nCompensation Plan Information The following\ntable provides information as of December 31,\n2021, with respect to our equity compensation\nplans under which shares of Capital One common\nstock are authorized to be issued.\n                                              \n                                      Number  \n                                          of  \n               Number                securi\u2026  \n                   of                remain\u2026  \n             securit\u2026    Weighte\u2026    availa\u2026  \n                to be    exercise        for  \n               issued       price     future  \n                 upon          of    issuan\u2026  \n             exercise    outstan\u2026      under  \n                   of    options,     equity  \n             outstan\u2026    warrants    compen\u2026  \n             options,         and      plans  \n             warrants      rights    (exclu\u2026  \n                  and                securi\u2026  \n               rights                reflec\u2026  \n                                          in  \n                                      column  \n                                        (a))  \n  Plan             -a          -b         -c  \n  Catego\u2026                                     \n  Equity                                      \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plans                                       \n  approv\u2026    7,144,5\u2026      $67.92    25,487\u2026  \n  by                                          \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  holder\u2026                                     \n  Equity                                      \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plans                                       \n  not        24,340(\u2026           $\u0097        \u0097(5)  \n  approv\u2026                                     \n  by                                          \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  holders                                     \n  Total      7,168,8\u2026      $67.92    25,487\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The following plans have been          \n       approved by Capital One stockholders   \n  (1)  and are currently in effect: the 2004  \n       Stock                                  \n       Incentive Plan and the 2002 Associate  \n       Stock Purchase Plan.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Excludes purchase rights accruing      \n       under the 2002 Associate Stock         \n       Purchase Plan.

As a matter of practice, members\nof our staff assist our executive officers and\ndirectors in preparing initial ownership\nreports and reporting ownership changes and\ntypically file these reports on their behalf.\nBased solely on our review of the copies of\nsuch forms in our possession and written\nrepresentations furnished to us, we believe\nthat in 2021 each reporting person complied\nwith these filing requirements, except as\ndescribed below. Mr. Shattuck filed a late\nForm 4 to report a stock option exercise of\nCapital One common stock, and Timothy Golden,\nCapital One\u0092s Principal Accounting Officer,\nfiled an amended Form 4 to report the grant of\na restricted stock unit award of Capital One\ncommon stock that had inadvertently been\nexcluded from the initial Form 4, in each case\ndue to an administrative error by the Company.\nAdditionally, in 2021, Mr. Williams did not\nfile accurate or timely Section 16 reports\nwith respect to holdings and transactions of\nCapital One common stock held in a managed\ninvestment account maintained by Mr. Williams\nwith an investment advisor who had discretion\nto make individual investment decisions in the\naccounts. On March 11, 2022, he filed an\namended Form 3 and a Form 4. Mr. Williams\u0092s\nunreported holdings and trading activity\ninvolved a total of 74 shares of Capital One\ncommon stock (four reports and six\ntransactions total).\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  118    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection IX - Compensation Committee Report All\nmembers of the Compensation Committee\nparticipated in the review and discussion of\nthe Compensation Discussion and Analysis\n(\u0093CD&A\u0094) with management.

The Audit\nCommittee evaluates the independent registered\npublic accounting firm\u0092s qualifications,\nperformance, and independence at least\nannually and periodically considers whether to\ncontinue to retain our current independent\nregistered public accounting firm or engage\nanother firm. In connection with applicable\npartner rotation requirements, the Audit\nCommittee and its Chair are involved in\nconsidering the selection of the independent\nregistered public accounting firm\u0092s new lead\npartner and concurring/reviewing partner.\nAdditionally, Capital One adheres to the\nrequirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\n(\u0093Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u0094) relating to the\nrotation of partners engaged in Capital One\u0092s\naudit by the independent registered public\naccounting firm. For 2022, the Audit Committee\nhas appointed Ernst & Young as Capital One\u0092s\nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nErnst & Young has served in this role since\n1994. The members of the Audit Committee and\nthe Board believe that the continued retention\nof Ernst & Young as Capital One\u0092s independent\nregistered public accounting firm is in the\nbest interests of Capital One and its\nstockholders. The Board is submitting this\nproposal to the vote of the stockholders as a\nmatter of good corporate governance. If\nstockholders do not ratify the selection of\nErnst & Young, the Audit Committee will\nreconsider the appointment of Ernst & Young as\nthe Company\u0092s independent registered public\naccounting firm. Even if the selection is\nratified, the Audit Committee may, in its\ndiscretion, appoint a different independent\nregistered public accounting firm at any time\nduring the year if the Audit Committee\ndetermines that such a change would be in our\nstockholders\u0092 best interests. The fees billed\nfor professional services provided by Ernst &\nYoung for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are shown\nin the following table:\n                                              \n  Fees (dollars in            2021      2020  \n  millions)                                   \n  Audit Fees                $12.04    $13.34  \n  Audit-Related Fees         $1.69     $1.36  \n  Tax Fees                   $0.00     $0.00  \n  All Other Fees             $0.00     $0.00  \n                                              \nDescription of Fees \u0093Audit Fees\u0094 include fees\nfor the audit of our annual financial\nstatements, the review of unaudited interim\nfinancial information included in our\nquarterly reports on Form 10-Q,and services\nthat normally would be provided by the\nregistered public accounting firm in\nconnection with statutory and regulatory\nfilings or engagements and that generally only\nthe independent registered public accounting\nfirm can provide. In addition to fees for an\naudit or review in accordance with generally\naccepted auditing standards, this category\ncontains fees for comfort letters, statutory\nand subsidiary audits, consents, and\nassistance with and review of documents filed\nwith the SEC. \u0093Audit-Related Fees\u0094 include\nfees related to assurance and related services\nthat are reasonably related to the performance\nof the audit or review of our financial\nstatements and traditionally are performed by\nthe independent registered public accounting\nfirm, such as: compliance testing and\nreporting; internal control reviews;\nattestation services that are not required by\nstatute or regulation; and agreed upon\nprocedure reports. \u0093Tax Fees\u0094 include fees for\ncorporate and subsidiary tax compliance\nservices. \u0093All Other Fees\u0094 include fees for\nservices that are not defined as Audit, Audit-\nRelated, or Tax and are not specifically\nprohibited by the SEC.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  120    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                 \n  AUDIT MATTERS  \n                 \n                                              \n  Section X - Proposal 3: Ratification of     \n  Selection                                   \n  of Independent Registered Public            \n  Accounting Firm                             \n                                              \nAudit Committee Fee Approval Procedures The\nAudit Committee is responsible for approving\nall fees and terms of engagement for audit,\naudit-related, and permissible non-\nauditservices provided by Ernst & Young. The\nAudit Committee has reviewed the fees paid to\nErnst & Young and has considered whether the\nfees paid for non-Auditservices are compatible\nwith maintaining Ernst & Young\u0092s independence.\nThe Audit Committee also adopted policies and\nprocedures to approve services provided by\nErnst & Young in accordance with the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act and rules of the SEC promulgated\nthereunder. These policies and procedures\ninvolve annual pre-approvalby the Audit\nCommittee of the types of services to be\nprovided by Capital One\u0092s independent\nregistered public accounting firm and fee\nlimits for each type of service on both a per\nengagement and aggregate level. Any service\nengagements that exceed these pre-\napprovedlimits must be submitted to the Audit\nCommittee for specific pre-approval.If the\nactual expenditure for pre-approvedservices is\nanticipated to exceed, or exceeds, the pre-\napprovedcost levels by more than $50,000, the\nincremental amount requires separate approval\nby the Audit Committee. In 2021, all of the\nAudit and Audit-Related Fees and related\nservices were pre-approvedby the Audit\nCommittee pursuant to the policies and\nprocedures described above. Under the policy\nadopted by the Audit Committee, Tax Fees are\nlimited to 25% of combined Audit and Audit-\nRelated Fees, and services that would fall\nunder the category \u0093All Other Fees\u0094 are\nprohibited. One or more representatives of\nErnst & Young are expected to be present at\nthe 2022 Annual Stockholder Meeting. They will\nhave the opportunity to make a statement if\nthey desire to do so and will be available to\nrespond to appropriate questions from\nstockholders. *** The Board of Directors\nunanimously recommends that you vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the\nratification of Ernst & Young LLP as Capital\nOne\u0092s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2022.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2022\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           121  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                 \n  AUDIT MATTERS  \n                 \nSection XI - Audit Committee Report Roles and\nResponsibilities of the Audit Committee In\naccordance with its charter, the Audit\nCommittee assists the Board of Directors in\nfulfilling its obligations with respect to the\nitems listed in \u0093Committee Responsibilities\u0094\non page 40.

No\nmember of the Audit Committee simultaneously\nserves on the audit committees of more than\nthree public companies, including that of\nCapital One. Audit Committee Policies and\nProcedures The Audit Committee has implemented\nprocedures to enable it to devote the\nattention it deems appropriate to each of the\nmatters assigned to it under its charter,\nincluding candid communications with\nmanagement and Ernst & Young LLP (\u0093Ernst &\nYoung\u0094), Capital One\u0092s independent registered\npublic accounting firm, to discuss new\nauditing standards and emerging audit-related\nissues. In carrying out its responsibilities,\nthe Audit Committee met a total of 11 times\nduring 2021.

In addition, these non-\nGAAPmeasures are reviewed by the Compensation\nCommittee and the other independent members of\nour Board of Directors as part of their\nassessment of the Company\u0092s performance. While\ncertain of our non-GAAPmeasures are widely\nused by investors, analysts, and bank\nregulatory agencies to assess the capital\nposition of financial services companies, they\nmay not be comparable to similarly-titled\nmeasures reported by other companies.
