The following MD&A is\nprovided as a supplement to, and should be\nread in conjunction with, our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes in this\nReport and the more detailed information\ncontained in our 2020 Form 10-K.\n                \n  INTRODUCTION  \n                \nCapital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware\ncorporation established in 1994 and\nheadquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) offer a broad\narray of financial products and services to\nconsumers, small businesses and commercial\nclients through digital channels, branches,\nCaf\u00e9s and other distribution channels.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, our principal\nsubsidiaries included:\n\n\u2022 Capital One Bank (USA), National Association\n(\u201cCOBNA\u201d), which offers credit and debit card\nproducts, other lending products and deposit\nproducts; and\n\n\u2022 Capital One, National Association (\u201cCONA\u201d),\nwhich offers a broad spectrum of banking\nproducts and financial services to consumers,\nsmall businesses and commercial clients.\n\nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d COBNA and CONA are\ncollectively referred to as the \u201cBanks.\u201d\nCertain business terms used in this document\nare defined in the \u201cMD&A\u2014Glossary and\nAcronyms\u201d and should be read in conjunction\nwith the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Report.\n\nOur consolidated total net revenues are\nderived primarily from lending to consumer,\nsmall business and commercial customers net of\nfunding costs associated with interest on\ndeposits, long-term debt and other borrowings.\nWe also earn non-interest income which\nprimarily consists of interchange income, net\nof reward expenses, service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees. Our expenses primarily\nconsist of the provision for credit losses,\noperating expenses, marketing expenses and\nincome taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at\nthe consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments,\nare included in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d).\n                                              \n  4    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our commercial and industrial\ncustomers typically include companies with\nannual revenues between $20 million and $2\nbillion.\n                                              \n   Business Developments                      \n                                              \nWe regularly explore and evaluate\nopportunities to acquire financial services\nand products as well as financial assets,\nincluding credit card and other loan\nportfolios, and enter into strategic\npartnerships as part of our growth strategy.\nWe also explore opportunities to acquire\ntechnology companies and related assets to\nimprove our information technology\ninfrastructure and to deliver on our digital\nstrategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund\nour acquisitions. In addition, we regularly\nconsider the potential disposition of certain\nassets, branches, partnership agreements or\nlines of business.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into\nan agreement to sell a partnership credit card\nloan portfolio of approximately $2.1 billion,\nwhich had been transferred to held for sale as\nof September 30, 2020, resulting in an\nallowance release of $327 million.\n                                              \n  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)         \n  Pandemic                                    \n                                              \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global\npublic-health crisis, disrupting economies and\nintroducing significant volatility into\nfinancial markets and uncertainty as to when\neconomic and operating conditions will return\nto normalcy. This crisis continues to impact\nindividuals, households and businesses in a\nmultitude of ways. Companies in the United\nStates of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and abroad have\nexperienced unprecedented disruptions to\nnormal business operations, including\ncustomer-facing interactions, supply chains,\noffice closures, changes in demand for\nproducts and services, and others. Financial\ninstitutions, including us, have been deemed\nan essential service and exempted from the\nmyriad of shutdowns across the country. We\nhave transformed how we work in order to\nprotect the well-being of our associates and\nour customers, serve our customers, support\nour communities, and position ourselves to\nnavigate the challenges ahead.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a\nsignificant majority of our associates across\nour workforce have transitioned to working\nremotely, relying on our technology\ninfrastructure and systems that have been\ndesigned for resilience and security. The\nmajority of our associates will continue to\nwork remotely through at least the summer of\n2021, as we continue to prioritize their\nsafety while planning our return to the\noffice. We have been able to continue serving\ncustomers, successfully managing critical\nfunctions and keeping our lines of business\noperating. We have implemented additional paid\nbenefits and flexible attendance policies that\nare intended to enable our associates to care\nfor their families and loved ones, including\nincreased pay for branch and Caf\u00e9 associates\nworking in open locations, associates that\nperform essential and time-sensitive banking\nactivities that cannot be performed remotely,\nand other U.S.-based associates in roles\ninstrumental to maintaining essential customer\nsupport. We continue to monitor and revise our\nsafety precautions and policies at banking\nlocations as government authorities continue\nto implement and modify measures to contain\nthe further spread of COVID-19. In our Retail\nBanking business, we have reopened nearly all\nof our Caf\u00e9s and branches across our network\nwith increased safety precautions. We will\ncontinue to monitor local conditions to ensure\nthe safety of our associates and customers\nwhile providing critical banking services.\n\nBeginning in March 2020, we offered a range of\npolicies and programs to accommodate customer\nhardship across our lines of business, with\nthe largest program offerings in our Auto and\nDomestic Credit Card businesses. Enrollments\nin these programs peaked early in the pandemic\nand have declined to low levels thereafter. In\naddition, we continue to participate in the\nPaycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d),\nestablished by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,\nand Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d)\nenacted in March 2020 and implemented by the\nSmall Business Administration. See\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Credit Risk Profile\u201d for more\ninformation about our customer assistance\nprograms and enrollment volumes.\n\nWe reported net income of $3.3 billion ($7.03\nper diluted common share) for the first\nquarter of 2021, which reflects an allowance\nrelease of $1.6 billion.

In our Domestic Card business, the\nyear-over-year percentage change in ending\nloan balances this quarter was approximately\nthe same as it was last quarter. Rebounding\nspend levels were offset by the effects of\ngovernment stimulus on Card payment rates,\nwhich continue to pressure loan balances. In\nour Auto business, we saw an increase in\norigination volumes and loan growth driven by\nour relationship strategy and digital\ncapabilities along with strong industry sales.\nIn our Retail Banking business, we continue to\nsee high deposit volumes driven by increased\nconsumer savings aided by the impact of\nrecently passed government stimulus. In our\nCommercial Banking business, revenue was up\nyear-over-year as margins improved. Deposit\nbalances were up significantly, reflecting the\nimpact of the economic environment and\ngovernment stimulus on our customers, while\naverage loan balances declined modestly.\n\nWe are actively monitoring and responding to\ndevelopments across the myriad of landscapes\naffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nsocial, financial, legal, regulatory and\ngovernmental. As guidance is issued by\ngovernments and our regulators, we continue to\nassess the impacts on us. As government\nauthorities continue to implement, modify and\nreinstate social distancing and reopening\nplans and other measures to contain the\nfurther spread of COVID-19, we will continue\nto adjust our business operations, policies\nand practices, keeping the best interests of\nour associates, customers and business\npartners at the forefront.\n\nSee \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1A.

We also provide\nselected key metrics we use in evaluating our\nperformance, including certain metrics that\nare computed using non-GAAP measures. We\nconsider these metrics to be key financial\nmeasures that management uses in assessing our\noperating performance, capital adequacy and\nthe level of returns generated. We believe\nthese non-GAAP metrics provide useful insight\nto investors and users of our financial\ninformation as they provide an alternate\nmeasurement of our performance and assist in\nassessing

We\nexpect net interest income and our net\ninterest margin to fluctuate based on changes\nin interest rates and changes in the amount\nand composition of our interest-earning assets\nand interest-bearing liabilities.\n                                              \n  11    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 2 below presents the average outstanding\nbalance, interest income earned, interest\nexpense incurred and average yield for the\nfirst quarters of 2021 and 2020 for each major\ncategory of our interest-earning assets and\ninterest-bearing liabilities.

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\ncalculation of our residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments, are included in the\nOther category.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenue and expenses directly or\nindirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation process is\nunique to each business segment and acquired\nbusiness. We regularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.

We have continued to evaluate\nthe potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\non our goodwill impairment analysis and have\nconsidered recent market events and trends.

Moreover, the Banks, as insured\ndepository institutions, are subject to prompt\ncorrective action (\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations.\n                                              \n  Basel III and United States Capital Rules   \n                                              \nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer and countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirements, as described\nbelow.\n\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve, OCC and\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the\n\u201cFDIC,\u201d and collectively, the Federal Banking\nAgencies\u201d) amended the Basel III Capital Rules\nto provide for tailored application of certain\ncapital requirements across different\ncategories of banking institutions (the\n\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). These categories are\ndetermined primarily by an institution\u2019s asset\nsize, with adjustments to a more stringent\ncategory possible if the institution exceeds\ncertain risk-based thresholds. As a bank\nholding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nthat does not exceed any of the applicable\nrisk-based thresholds, we are a Category III\ninstitution under the Tailoring Rules.\nTherefore, effective January 1, 2020, we are\nno longer subject to the Basel III \u201cAdvanced\nApproaches\u201d framework and certain associated\ncapital requirements, and we have elected to\nexclude certain elements of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our\nregulatory capital as permitted by the\nTailoring Rules. We remain subject to the\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%) and\nsupplementary leverage ratio requirement,\nwhich were previously required only for Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches institutions.\n                                              \n  28    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe G-SIB Surcharge. We are not a G-SIB based\non the most recent available data and thus we\nare not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. The\ncapital conservation buffer for BHCs was\npreviously fixed at 2.5%. In March 2020, the\nFederal Reserve issued a final rule to\nimplement the stress capital buffer\nrequirement (the \u201cStress Capital Buffer\nRule\u201d). The stress capital buffer requirement\nis institution-specific and replaces the fixed\n2.5% capital conservation buffer for BHCs.\n\nPursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule,\nthe Federal Reserve will use the results of\nits supervisory stress test to determine the\nsize of a BHC\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement. In particular, a BHC\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement will equal, subject\nto a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the\ndifference between the BHC\u2019s starting CET1\ncapital ratio and its lowest projected CET1\ncapital ratio under the severely adverse\nscenario of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory\nstress test plus (ii) the ratio of the BHC\u2019s\nprojected four quarters of common stock\ndividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters\nof the planning horizon) to the projected\nrisk-weighted assets for the quarter in which\nthe BHC\u2019s projected CET1 capital ratio reaches\nits minimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nUnder the Stress Capital Buffer Rule\nframework, the Company\u2019s new \u201cstandardized\napproach capital conservation buffer\u201d includes\nits stress capital buffer requirement (which\nwill be recalibrated every year based on the\nCompany\u2019s supervisory stress test results),\nany G-SIB surcharge (which is not applicable\nto us) and the countercyclical capital buffer\nrequirement (which is currently set at 0%).\nAny determination to increase the\ncountercyclical capital buffer generally would\nbe effective twelve months after the\nannouncement of such an increase, unless the\nFederal Banking Agencies set an earlier\neffective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is 5.6% for the period from\nOctober 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, at\nwhich point a revised stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be applicable to the Company\nbased on the Company\u2019s 2021 stress testing\nresults. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum\ncapital requirements plus the standardized\napproach capital conservation buffer for CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital and total capital\nratios under the stress capital buffer\nframework are 10.1%, 11.6% and 13.6%,\nrespectively, for the period from October 1,\n2020 through September 30, 2021.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Banks. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, each Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios remain at 7.0%, 8.5% and\n10.5% respectively.\n\nIf we fail to maintain our capital ratios\nabove the minimum capital requirements plus\nthe applicable buffer requirements, we will\nface increasingly strict automatic limitations\non capital distributions and discretionary\nbonus payments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively, each of the Company and the\nBanks exceeded the minimum capital\nrequirements and the buffer requirements\napplicable to them, and each of the Banks was\n\u201cwell capitalized\u201d under PCA requirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading portfolios. The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more. As of March 31, 2021, the Company and\nCONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule.

For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies use a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions are permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. Beginning January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory\ncapital at 25% per year.

The Company\u2019s\nsupplementary leverage ratio as of March 31,\n2021 reflected these temporary exclusions.\nWithout these temporary exclusions, we would\nhave remained substantially in excess of the\n3% regulatory minimum as of March 31, 2021.\n\nIn May 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies\nissued an interim final rule that provides an\noption for depository institutions to make\nsimilar exclusions to the calculation of the\nsupplementary leverage ratio. If a depository\ninstitution elects to make such exclusions, it\nmust request prior approval from its primary\nfederal banking regulator before making\ncapital distributions, such as paying\ndividends to its parent company, for as long\nas the exclusions are in effect. These\ntemporary exclusions remained in effect for\nelecting institutions through March 31, 2021\nand expired as scheduled thereafter. Neither\nCONA nor COBNA elected to make such\nexclusions.\n\nFor the description of the regulatory capital\nrules we are subject to, see \u201cMD&A\u2014Supervision\nand Regulation\u201d in this Report as well as\n\u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.

distribution\nrestrictions in place during the first quarter\nof 2021 for all BHCs participating in the\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(\u201cCCAR\u201d) through the second quarter of 2021.\nIn particular, for the first and second\nquarters of 2021, the aggregate amount of\ncommon stock dividend payments and share\nrepurchases for each quarter shall not exceed\nan amount equal to the average net income\nearned across the four preceding calendar\nquarters. In addition, common stock dividend\npayments for each of the first and second\nquarters of 2021 continue to be capped at the\namount paid in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nIf a participating BHC remains above all of\nits minimum risk-based capital requirements in\nits 2021 supervisory stress test, these\ntemporary capital distribution restrictions\nwill no longer apply to such BHC after the\nsecond quarter of 2021, and the normal\nrestrictions under the stress capital buffer\nframework will apply instead. For any\nparticipating BHC that falls below any of its\nminimum risk-based capital requirements in its\n2021 supervisory stress test, these temporary\ncapital distribution restrictions will\ncontinue to apply for such BHC through the end\nof the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn April 2, 2021, we submitted our capital\nplan to the Federal Reserve as part of the\n2021 CCAR cycle. The stress testing results\nare expected to be released by the Federal\nReserve by July 1, 2021. Our 2021 supervisory\nstress test result will determine the size of\nour stress capital buffer requirement for the\nperiod beginning from October 1, 2021 through\nSeptember 30, 2022.\n\nOn January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors\nauthorized the repurchase of up to $7.5\nbillion of shares of our common stock and we\nrepurchased approximately $490 million of\nshares of our common stock during the first\nquarter of 2021. Based on our average net\nincome across the four preceding calendar\nquarters, our share repurchase capacity in the\nsecond quarter of 2021 is expected to be\napproximately $1.7 billion.\n                                              \n  32    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nFor the description of the regulatory capital\nplanning rules we are subject to, see\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d in this\nReport as well as \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d in our\n2020 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  Equity Offerings and Transactions           \n                                              \nOn May 4, 2021, we issued 27,000,000\ndepositary shares, each representing a 1/40th\ninterest in a share of Fixed Rate Non-\nCumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series\nL, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation\npreference of $25 per depositary share\n(\u201cSeries L Preferred Stock\u201d).

As of March 31, 2021, funds available\nfor dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were\n$4.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\nThere can be no assurance that we will declare\nand pay any dividends to stockholders.\n\nOn January 25, 2021, our Board of Directors\nauthorized the repurchase of up to $7.5\nbillion of shares of our common stock and we\nrepurchased approximately $490 million of\nshares of our common stock during the first\nquarter of 2021.

Each\nline of business or first line function is\nresponsible for managing the risks associated\nwith their activities, including identifying,\nassessing, measuring, monitoring, controlling\nand reporting the risks within its business\nactivities, consistent with the risk\nframework. The \u201cSecond Line of Defense\u201d\nconsists of two types of functions:\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d) and\nSupport Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking\nactivities and assesses risks and issues\nindependent from the first line of defense.\nSupport Functions are centers of specialized\nexpertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting,\nLegal) that provide support services to the\nCompany. The \u201cThird Line of Defense\u201d is\ncomprised of the Internal Audit and Credit\nReview functions.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 22 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020.\n                                              \n  Table 22: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            March 31,        December     \n  portfoli\u2026          2021        31, 2020     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater              70  %           69  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or               30              31     \n  below                                       \n  Total               100  %          100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater              47  %           46  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660            20              20     \n  620 or               33              34     \n  below                                       \n  Total               100  %          100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

We\ncharge off loans as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses when we determine\nthe loan is uncollectible and record\nsubsequent recoveries of previously charged\noff amounts as increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Uncollectible finance charges\nand fees are reversed through revenue and\ncertain fraud losses are recorded in other\nnon-interest expense. Generally, costs to\nrecover charged-off loans are recorded as\ncollection expenses as incurred and included\nin our consolidated statements of income as a\ncomponent of other non-interest expense. Our\ncharge-off policy for loans varies based on\nthe loan type.

The\ncontractual term of the loan is extended by\nthe length of the payment extension and the\ndelinquency status is updated to reflect the\nrevised terms of the loan.\n\nWithin our Domestic Card business, our primary\noffering is a one-month payment deferral, with\nthe option to renew (subject to a cap).\nDelinquency status is generally frozen at the\ntime of enrollment and then resumes upon\nexiting the program.\n\nGuidance issued by the Federal Banking\nAgencies and contained in the CARES Act\nprovides banking organizations with TDR relief\nfor loan modifications to current borrowers\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nmajority of enrollments in our COVID-19\nprograms through March 31, 2021 would\ngenerally not have resulted in TDR\nclassification under our existing policies as\nthe concession granted was insignificant.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications, including those offered via our\nCOVID-19 programs, when estimating the credit\nquality of our loan portfolio and establishing\nallowance levels.\n\nTable 28 presents cumulative and active\nenrollment information for our Auto and\nDomestic Card customer accommodation programs.\nTable 28: COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program\nEnrollments in Auto and Domestic Credit Card\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Defined as customers who have been\napproved to skip their upcoming payment and\nhave not made that payment.\n\n(2) Current is defined as less than 30 days\npast due.\n\n(3) Does not include certain retail\npartnership portfolios.\n                                              \n  Temporary Payment Reduction Programs        \n                                              \nIn addition to the above programs, we also\noffer temporary payment reduction programs to\nour auto and domestic credit card customers\nranging from 6-9 months.

The effective\ninterest rate in effect immediately prior to\nthe loan modification is used as the effective\ninterest rate for purposes of measuring\nimpairment using the present value of expected\ncash flows. If the customer does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then the\ncredit card loan agreement may revert to its\noriginal payment terms, generally resulting in\nany loan outstanding reflected in the\nappropriate delinquency category and charged\noff in accordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, an interest rate reduction or\nprincipal reduction, or a combination of these\nconcessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\namortized cost.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, with a portion of these loans\nreceiving an interest rate reduction or a\ngross balance reduction. The impairment on\nmodified commercial loans is generally\ndetermined based on the underlying collateral\nvalue.\n\nWe provide additional information on modified\nloans accounted for as TDRs, including the\nperformance of those loans subsequent to\nmodification, in \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans.\u201d\n                                              \n  45    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date.

Our primary market\nrisk exposures include interest rate risk,\nforeign exchange risk and commodity pricing\nrisk. We are exposed to market risk primarily\nfrom the following operations and activities:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of deposit\ngathering and lending;\n\n\u2022 Asset/liability management activities\nincluding the management of investment\nsecurities, short-term and long-term\nborrowings and derivatives;\n\n\u2022 Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada\nwithin our Credit Card business; and\n\n\u2022 Customer accommodation activities within our\nCommercial Banking business.\n\nWe have enterprise-wide risk management\npolicies and limits, approved by our Board of\nDirectors, which govern our market risk\nmanagement activities. Our objective is to\nmanage our exposure to market risk in\naccordance with these policies and limits\nbased on prevailing market conditions and\nlong-term expectations. We provide additional\ninformation below about our primary sources of\nmarket risk, our market risk management\nstrategies and the measures that we use to\nevaluate these exposures.\n                                              \n  50    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Risk                          \n                                              \nInterest rate risk represents exposure to\nfinancial instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest rates. We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or re-pricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments, including\ncaps, floors, options, futures and forward\ncontracts.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact on our projected 12-month\nbaseline interest rate-sensitive revenue\nresulting from movements in interest rates.\nInterest rate-sensitive revenue consists of\nnet interest income and certain components of\nother non-interest income significantly\nimpacted by movements in interest rates,\nincluding changes in the fair value of\nfreestanding interest rate derivatives. In\naddition to our existing assets and\nliabilities, we incorporate expected future\nbusiness growth assumptions, such as loan and\ndeposit growth and pricing, and plans for\nprojected changes in our funding mix in our\nbaseline forecast. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\nprojected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we\nassume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel\nshift in the level of interest rates detailed\nin Table 36 below. At the current level of\ninterest rates, our interest rate sensitive\nrevenue is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate\nscenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward\nshocks has decreased as compared to December\n31, 2020, mainly due to the increase in long-\nterm interest rates.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity                    \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact on the net\npresent value of our assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivative exposures, resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Key\nassumptions used in the calculation include\nprojecting rate sensitive prepayments for\nmortgage securities, loans and other assets,\nterm structure modeling of interest rates,\ndiscount spreads, and deposit volume and\npricing assumptions. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\neconomic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n36 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity increasing in\nmoderately higher interest rate scenarios (+50\nand +100 bps), while decreasing in a more\nextreme higher interest rate scenario (+200\nbps) and a lower interest rate scenario (-50\nbps). Similar to the changes in net interest\nincome sensitivity, our current economic value\nof equity sensitivity to upward shocks has\nalso decreased as compared to December 31,\n2020 mainly due to the increase in long term\ninterest rates.\n\nTable 36 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand economic value of equity calculated under\nthe methodology described above as of March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In instances\nwhere an interest rate scenario would result\nin a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%\nfor that scenario.

Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on the existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cNote 8\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities.\u201d\n                                              \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                       \n                                              \nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to\nchanges in the values of current holdings and\nfuture cash flows denominated in other\ncurrencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nintercompany funding outstanding was 210\nmillion GBP and 320 million GBP as of March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively,\nand 4.8 billion CAD and 5.3 billion CAD as of\nMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively. Our EUR-denominated borrowings\noutstanding were 1.3 billion EUR as of both\nMarch 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n                                              \n  52    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet to\ntranslation risk in AOCI and our capital\nratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 1.7 billion\nGBP as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020 and 1.6 billion CAD and 1.5 billion CAD\nas of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal. For further information on our\nrisk related to customer accommodation\nderivatives, see \u201cNote 8\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities.\u201d\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d)\nTransition\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority (\u201cFCA\u201d), the regulator for the\nadministration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR\nwould be transitioned as an interest rate\nbenchmark and that it will no longer compel\nbanks to contribute LIBOR data beyond December\n31, 2021. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nestablished the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a group of private market\nparticipants and ex-officio members\nrepresenting banking and financial sector\nregulators. The ARRC has recommended Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the\npreferred alternative rate for certain U.S.\ndollar derivative and cash instruments. While\nthe ARRC has recommended SOFR as the\nreplacement rate for LIBOR, some markets\nparticipants have begun using alternate rates\nfeaturing a credit-sensitive element. We are\ncontinuing to evaluate the different LIBOR\nalternatives and how their progression will\nimpact our transition efforts.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark\nAdministration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of\nLIBOR, confirmed its intention to cease\npublication of the 1-week and 2-month USD\nLIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR\npublication on December 31, 2021, and the\nremaining USD LIBOR tenors (overnight 1, 3, 6,\nand 12 months) immediately following the LIBOR\npublication on June 30, 2023. The continuation\nof USD LIBOR as a representative rate into\nmid-2023 will allow many legacy USD LIBOR\ncontracts to mature prior to cessation.\nFollowing IBA\u2019s announcement, the FCA formally\nannounced the future permanent cessation and\nloss of representativeness of LIBOR\nbenchmarks.\n\nWe have exposures to LIBOR, including loans,\nderivative contracts, unsecured debt,\nsecuritizations, vendor agreements and other\ninstruments with attributes that are either\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. To\nfacilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR,\nwe have established a company-wide, cross-\nfunctional initiative to oversee and manage\nour transition away from LIBOR and other\nInterbank Offered Rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d) to\nalternative reference rates.\n\nWe have made progress on our transition\nefforts as we continue to insert LIBOR\ntransition language (\u201cfallback language\u201d) in\nnew and existing lending contracts as well as\nfallback language in derivatives contracts and\nagreements that adheres to the International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association (\u201cISDA\u201d)\nfallback protocol.\n                                              \n  53    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nWe also continue to focus our transition\nefforts on:\n\n\u2022 monitoring market developments related to\nSOFR and other LIBOR replacement indexes;\n\n\u2022 originating SOFR-based loans and transacting\nin SOFR-linked instruments;\n\n\u2022 reviewing existing legal contracts and\nagreements and assessing fallback language\nimpacts;\n\n\u2022 monitoring and reducing our inventory of\nLIBOR exposures;\n\n\u2022 building internal operational readiness and\nrisk management processes, including exposure\nreporting;\n\n\u2022 implementing necessary updates to our\ninfrastructure including systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes;\n\n\u2022 engaging with our clients, industry working\ngroups, and regulators; and\n\n\u2022 monitoring developments associated with\nLIBOR alternatives and industry practices\nrelated to LIBOR-indexed instruments.\nFor a further discussion of the various risks\nwe face in connection with the expected\nreplacement of LIBOR on our operations, see\n\u201cPart I\u2014Item 1A.

In\nparticular, for the second quarter of 2021,\nthe aggregate amount of common stock dividend\npayments and share repurchases shall not\nexceed an amount equal to the average net\nincome earned across the four preceding\ncalendar quarters. In addition, common stock\ndividend payments for the second quarter of\n2021 continue to be capped at the amount paid\nin the second quarter of 2020.\n\nIf a participating BHC remains above all of\nits minimum risk-based capital requirements in\nits 2021 supervisory stress test, these\ntemporary capital distribution restrictions\nwill no longer apply to such BHC after the\nsecond quarter of 2021, and the normal\nrestrictions under the stress capital buffer\nframework will apply instead. For any\nparticipating BHC that falls below any of its\nminimum risk-based capital requirements in its\n2021 supervisory stress test, these temporary\ncapital distribution restrictions will\ncontinue to apply for such BHC through the end\nof the third quarter of 2021.\nTemporary Exclusions for Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio\nThe temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve\nBanks from the supplementary leverage ratio\ndenominator for BHCs, as well as depository\ninstitutions that elected to make such\nexclusions, remained in effect through March\n31, 2021 and expired as scheduled thereafter.\nThese temporary exclusions were made to\nprovide flexibility for banking organizations\nto provide credit to households and businesses\nin light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n                                              \n  COVID-19 Activities                         \n                                              \nThe PPP has been expanded and extended by\nrecent legislation.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses for commercial loans. Generally,\nloans that are designated as criticized\nperforming and criticized nonperforming are\nreviewed quarterly by management to determine\nif they are appropriately classified/rated and\nwhether any impairment exists. Noncriticized\nloans are also generally reviewed, at least\nannually, to determine the appropriate risk\nrating. In addition, we evaluate the risk\nrating during the renewal process of any loan\nor if a loan becomes past due.\n                                              \n  80    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of March 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020.

Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults.

that are presented within our\nconsolidated financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses.

Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which have provided a source of funding\nfor us and enabled us to transfer a certain\nportion of the economic risk of the loans or\nrelated debt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet our maximum remaining funding\nobligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We\nseparately present information for\nconsolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       17       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       43       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  88    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       17       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       43       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities owned by the VIE, which\nincludes the seller\u2019s interest and repurchased\nnotes held by other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.2billion of assets and $\n575million of liabilities as of March 31,\n2021, and $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n596million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2020.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to Government-\nsponsored enterprise (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service\nthe transferred loans pursuant to the\nguidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an\ninvestor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and\nABS in our investment securities portfolio,\nwhich represent variable interests in the\nrespective securitization trusts from which\nthose securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either invest in securities issued by\nthe VIE and were not involved in the design of\nthe VIE or no transfers have occurred between\nthe VIE and us. Our maximum exposure to loss\nas a result of our involvement with these VIEs\nis the carrying value of the MSRs and\ninvestment securities on our consolidated\nbalance sheets as well as our contractual\nobligations under loss sharing arrangements.\nSee \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d\nfor information related to our MSRs associated\nwith these securitizations and \u201cNote\n2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for more information\non the securities held in our investment\nsecurities portfolio. In addition, where we\nhave certain lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business with entities that\ncould be VIEs, we have also excluded these\nVIEs from the tables presented in this note.\nSee \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for additional information\nregarding our lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business.\n                                              \n  89    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents our continuing\ninvolvement in certain securitization-related\nVIEs as of March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020.\nTable 5.2: Continuing Involvement in\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n                                              \n  (Doll\u2026                                      \n  in                                          \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  March                                       \n  31,           Credit                        \n  2021:           Card             Auto       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  held                                        \n  by        $   10,288         $  1,783       \n  third\u2026                                      \n  inves\u2026                                      \n  Recei\u2026                                      \n  in the        22,008            1,941       \n  trust                                       \n  Cash                                        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  spread             0               10       \n  or                                          \n  reser\u2026                                      \n  accou\u2026                                      \n  Retai\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Servi\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  retai\u2026                                      \n  Decem\u2026                                      \n  31,                                         \n  2020:                                       \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  held                                        \n  by        $   10,361         $  2,053       \n  third\u2026                                      \n  inves\u2026                                      \n  Recei\u2026                                      \n  in the        23,683            2,243       \n  trust                                       \n  Cash                                        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  spread             0               10       \n  or                                          \n  reser\u2026                                      \n  accou\u2026                                      \n  Retai\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Servi\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  retai\u2026                                      \n                                              \nCredit Card Securitizations\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card\nloans which provides a source of funding for\nus. Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritization involves the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain investments in qualified\naffordable housing projects using the\nproportional amortization method if certain\ncriteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the first three months of 2021\nand 2020, we recognized amortization of $\n156million and $ 139million, respectively, and\ntax credits of $ 258million and $ 155million,\nrespectively, associated with these\ninvestments within income tax provision or\nbenefit. The carrying value of our equity\ninvestments in these qualified affordable\nhousing projects was $ 4.6billion and $\n4.5billion as of March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, respectively. We are periodically\nrequired to provide additional financial or\nother support during the period of the\ninvestments. Our liability for these unfunded\ncommitments was $ 1.5billion as of both March\n31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, and is largely\nexpected to be paid from 2021 to 2023.\n                                              \n  90    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.7billion and $ 4.6billion as of March 31,\n2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The\ncreditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit and we do not provide\nadditional financial or other support other\nthan during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n11.0billion as of both March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments.

and Accounting for\nDerivatives\nWe regularly enter into derivative\ntransactions to support our overall risk\nmanagement activities. Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency derivatives to hedge, but we\nmay also use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We then enter\ninto derivative contracts with counterparties\nto economically hedge substantially all of our\nsubsequent exposures.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of AOCI. Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the forecasted transactions\nimpact earnings and presented in the same line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income\nas the earnings effect of the hedged items.\nOur cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps\nand floors that are intended to hedge the\nvariability in interest receipts or interest\npayments on some of our variable-rate\nfinancial assets or liabilities. We also enter\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  94    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that arises from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d) and\nthe LCH Group (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs for our\ncentrally cleared contracts. In our uncleared\nbilateral contracts, we enter into agreements\ndirectly with our derivative counterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements, where possible, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. The amount of collateral\nexchanged is dependent upon the fair value of\nthe derivative instruments as well as the fair\nvalue of the pledged collateral and will vary\nover time as market variables change. When\nvaluing collateral, an estimate of the\nvariation in price and liquidity over time is\nsubtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d to\ndiscount the value of the collateral pledged.\nOur exposure to derivative counterparty credit\nrisk, at any point in time, is equal to the\namount reported as a derivative asset on our\nbalance sheet. The fair value of our\nderivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis\nto take into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand any associated cash collateral received or\npledged. See Table 8.3 for our net exposure\nassociated with derivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. Futures commission merchants\n(\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the intermediary between\nCCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial\nand variation margin through our FCMs to\nmitigate the risk of non-payment or default.\nInitial margin is required upfront by CCPs as\ncollateral against potential losses on our\ncleared derivative contracts and variation\nmargin is exchanged on a daily basis to\naccount for mark-to-market changes in those\nderivative contracts. For CME and LCH-cleared\nOTC derivatives, we characterize variation\nmargin cash payments as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand collateral agreements, where possible,\nwith bilateral derivative counterparties to\nmitigate the risk of default. We review our\ncollateral positions on a daily basis and\nexchange collateral with our counterparties in\naccordance with these agreements. These\nbilateral agreements typically provide the\nright to offset exposure with the same\ncounterparty and require the party in a net\nliability position to post collateral.\nAgreements with certain bilateral\ncounterparties require both parties to\nmaintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of derivative instruments exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty. We also\nrecord debit valuation adjustments (\u201cDVAs\u201d) to\nadjust the fair values of our derivative\nliabilities to reflect the impact of our own\ncredit quality.\n                                              \n  95    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nBalance Sheet Presentation\nThe following table summarizes the notional\namounts and fair values of our derivative\ninstruments as of March 31, 2021 and December\n31, 2020, which are segregated by derivatives\nthat are designated as accounting hedges and\nthose that are not, and are further segregated\nby type of contract within those two\ncategories.

The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period. We consider all available\ninformation, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs.\nFor additional information on the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities on a\nrecurring basis, see \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value\nMeasurement\u201d in our 2020 Form 10-K.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following table displays our assets and\nliabilities measured on our consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of March 31, 2021 and December 31,\n2020.\nTable 11.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       2       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  106    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents balance sheet netting of\nderivative assets and liabilities, and related\npayables and receivables for cash collateral\nheld or placed with the same counterparty.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity\nand credit spreads, in isolation, would result\nin a decrease in the fair value measurement.\nIn addition, an increase in default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by a decrease\nin recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and\nan increase in liquidity spreads.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements\n\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments.

The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess provides a funds credit for sources of\nfunds, such as deposits generated by our\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a funds charge for the use of\nfunds by each segment. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate third-party rates.

Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as overdrafts and ATM\nusage. Service charges and other customer-\nrelated fees within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness are mostly related to fees earned on\ntreasury management and capital markets\nservices. Other contract revenue in our Credit\nCard business consists primarily of revenue\nfrom our partnership arrangements. Other\ncontract revenue in our Consumer Banking\nbusiness consists primarily of revenue earned\non certain marketing and promotional events\nfrom our auto dealers. Revenue from contracts\nwith customers is included in non-interest\nincome in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\n                                              \n  113    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents revenue from\ncontracts with customers and a reconciliation\nto non-interest income by business segment for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2021 and\n2020.\nTable 12.2: Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers and Reconciliation to Segment\nResults\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  57    $  \u2026    $   0    $  \u2026  \n         0       44       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       19       1        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       21       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  50    $  \u2026    $  -1    $  \u2026  \n         0       64       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       19       1        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         \u2026       -7       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n________\n(1) Some of our commercial investments\ngenerate tax-exempt income, tax credits or\nother tax benefits.

The contractual amount of these\ncommitments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to us should the counterparty draw\nupon the commitment. We generally manage the\npotential risk of unfunded lending commitments\nby limiting the total amount of arrangements,\nmonitoring the size and maturity structure of\nthese portfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of March 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020.

We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of the loans.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair\nvalue option on new loss sharing agreements.\nUnrealized gains and losses are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income. For those loss sharing\nagreements entered into as of and prior to\nDecember 31, 2019, we amortize the liability\nrecorded at inception into non-interest income\nas we are released from risk of payment under\nthe loss sharing agreement and record our\nestimate of expected credit losses each period\nin provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The\nliability recognized on our consolidated\nbalance sheets for these loss sharing\nagreements was $ 98million and $ 97million as\nof March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nrespectively.\nSee \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and\nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for\nmore information related to our credit card\npartnership loss sharing arrangements.\n                                              \n  115    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nLitigation\n\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for litigation-related matters that\narise from the ordinary course of our business\nactivities when it is probable that a loss\nassociated with a claim or proceeding has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of March\n31, 2021 are approximately $ 250million. Our\nreserve and reasonably possible loss estimates\ninvolve considerable judgment and reflect that\nthere is still significant uncertainty\nregarding numerous factors that may impact the\nultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding, our\nattempt to estimate a reasonably possible\nrange of loss beyond our current accrual\nlevels for some litigation matters based on\ncurrent information, it is possible that\nactual future losses will exceed both the\ncurrent accrual level and the range of\nreasonably possible losses disclosed here.\nGiven the inherent uncertainties involved in\nthese matters, especially those involving\ngovernmental agencies, and the very large or\nindeterminate damages sought in some of these\nmatters, there is significant uncertainty as\nto the ultimate liability we may incur from\nthese litigation matters and an adverse\noutcome in one or more of these matters could\nbe material to our results of operations or\ncash flows for any particular reporting\nperiod.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds settlements for its member\nbanks, and any settlements related to\nMasterCard-allocated losses have either\nalready been paid or are reflected in our\nreserves.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we\nare subject to numerous legal proceedings and\nother inquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We were named as a\ndefendant in approximately 73putative consumer\nclass action cases ( 61in U.S. federal courts\nand 12in Canadian courts) alleging harm from\nthe Cybersecurity Incident and seeking various\nremedies, including monetary and injunctive\nrelief. The lawsuits allege breach of\ncontract, negligence, violations of various\nprivacy laws and a variety of other legal\ncauses of action. The U.S. consumer class\nactions have been consolidated for pretrial\nproceedings before a multi-district litigation\n(\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria\nDivision, where the remaining 29consumer class\nactions are currently pending. In the third\nquarter of 2020, the MDL court denied in part\nand granted in part Capital One\u2019s motion to\ndismiss and permitted pretrial discovery to\ncontinue.\n                                              \n  116    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nSecurities class action . The Company and\ncertain officers have also been named as\ndefendants in a putative class action pending\nin the MDL alleging violations of certain\nfederal securities laws in connection with\nstatements and alleged omissions in securities\nfilings relating to our information security\nstandards and practices. The complaint seeks\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief.\n\nGovernmental inquiries . We have received\ninquiries and requests for information\nrelating to the Cybersecurity Incident from\nCongress, federal regulators, relevant\nCanadian regulators, the Department of\nJustice, and the offices of approximately\nfourteen state Attorneys General. We are\ncooperating with these offices and responding\nto their inquiries.\n\nIn August 2020, we entered into consent orders\nwith the Federal Reserve and the OCC resulting\nfrom regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity\nIncident and relating to ongoing enhancements\nof our cybersecurity and operational risk\nmanagement processes. We paid an $ 80million\npenalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the\nOCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement\ndid not contain a monetary penalty.\nTaxi Medallion Finance Investigations\nBeginning in 2019, we have received subpoenas\nfrom the New York Attorney General\u2019s office\nand from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nSouthern District of New York, Civil and\nCriminal Divisions, relating to investigations\nof the taxi medallion finance industry we\nexited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek,\namong other things, information regarding our\nlending counterparties and practices. We are\ncooperating with these investigations.\nU.K. PPI Litigation\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received\ncustomer complaints and regulatory claims\nrelating to PPI. As of the first quarter of\n2021, COEP has materially resolved the PPI\ncomplaints and regulatory claims received\nprior to the deadline. Some of the claimants\nin the U.K. PPI regulatory claims process have\nsubsequently initiated legal proceedings,\nseeking additional redress. We are responding\nto these proceedings as we receive them.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  117    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.
