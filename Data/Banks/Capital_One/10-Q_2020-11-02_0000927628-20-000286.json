The following MD&A is\nprovided as a supplement to, and should be\nread in conjunction with, our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes in this\nReport and the more detailed information\ncontained in our 2019 Form 10-K.\n                \n  INTRODUCTION  \n                \nWe are a diversified financial services\nholding company with banking and non-banking\nsubsidiaries. Capital One Financial\nCorporation and its subsidiaries (the\n\u201cCompany\u201d) offer a broad array of financial\nproducts and services to consumers, small\nbusinesses and commercial clients through\ndigital channels, branches, Caf\u00e9s and other\ndistribution channels. As of September 30,\n2020, our principal subsidiaries included:\n\n\u2022 Capital One Bank (USA), National Association\n(\u201cCOBNA\u201d), which offers credit and debit card\nproducts, other lending products and deposit\nproducts; and\n\n\u2022 Capital One, National Association (\u201cCONA\u201d),\nwhich offers a broad spectrum of banking\nproducts and financial services to consumers,\nsmall businesses and commercial clients.\n\nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d COBNA and CONA are\ncollectively referred to as the \u201cBanks.\u201d\nCertain business terms used in this document\nare defined in the \u201cMD&A\u2014Glossary and\nAcronyms\u201d and should be read in conjunction\nwith the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Report.\n\nOur consolidated total net revenues are\nderived primarily from lending to consumer,\nsmall business and commercial customers net of\nfunding costs associated with interest on\ndeposits, short-term borrowings and long-term\ndebt. We also earn non-interest income which\nprimarily consists of interchange income net\nof reward expenses, and service charges and\nother customer-related fees. Our expenses\nprimarily consist of the provision for credit\nlosses, operating expenses, marketing expenses\nand income taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a segment, such as management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio,\nasset/liability management by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and residual tax\nexpense or benefit to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate that is not\nassessed to our primary business segments, are\nincluded in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in Canada and\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d).\n                                              \n  4    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our commercial and industrial\ncustomers typically include companies with\nannual revenues between $20 million and $2\nbillion.\n                                              \n   Business Developments                      \n                                              \nWe regularly explore and evaluate\nopportunities to acquire financial services\nand products as well as financial assets,\nincluding credit card and other loan\nportfolios, and enter into strategic\npartnerships as part of our growth strategy.\nWe also explore opportunities to acquire\ntechnology companies and related assets to\nimprove our information technology\ninfrastructure and to deliver on our digital\nstrategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund\nour acquisitions. In addition, we regularly\nconsider the potential disposition of certain\nassets, branches, partnership agreements or\nlines of business.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, we transferred a\npartnership credit card loan portfolio of\napproximately $2.1 billion to held for sale,\nwhich resulted in an allowance release of $327\nmillion, as we expect to sell this portfolio.\n\nOn September 24, 2019, we launched a new\ncredit card issuance program with Walmart Inc.\n(\u201cWalmart\u201d) and are now the exclusive issuer\nof Walmart\u2019s cobrand and private label credit\ncard program in the United States of America\n(\u201cU.S.\u201d). On October 11, 2019, we completed\nthe acquisition of the existing portfolio of\nWalmart\u2019s cobrand and private label credit\ncard receivables, which added approximately\n$8.1 billion to our domestic credit card loans\nheld for investment portfolio as of the\nacquisition date.\n                                              \n  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)         \n  Pandemic                                    \n                                              \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global\npublic-health crisis, disrupting economies and\nintroducing significant volatility into\nfinancial markets and uncertainty as to when\neconomic and operating conditions will return\nto normalcy. This crisis continues to impact\nindividuals, households and businesses in a\nmultitude of ways. Companies in the U.S. and\nabroad have experienced unprecedented\ndisruptions to normal business operations,\nincluding customer-facing interactions, supply\nchains, office closures, changes in demand for\nproducts and services, and others. Financial\ninstitutions, including us, have been deemed\nan essential service and exempted from the\nmyriad of shutdowns across the country. We\nhave transformed how we work in order to\nprotect the well-being of our associates and\nour customers, serve our customers, support\nour communities, and position ourselves to\nnavigate the challenges ahead.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a\nsignificant majority of our associates across\nour workforce have transitioned to working\nremotely, relying on our technology\ninfrastructure and systems that have been\ndesigned for resilience and security. The\nmajority of our associates will continue to\nwork remotely throughout 2020, as we continue\nto prioritize their safety while planning our\nreturn to the office. We have been able to\ncontinue serving customers, successfully\nmanaging critical functions and keeping our\nlines of business operating. We have\nimplemented additional paid benefits and\nflexible attendance policies that are intended\nto enable our associates to care for their\nfamilies and loved ones, including increased\npay for branch associates working in open\nlocations, associates that perform essential\nand time-sensitive banking activities that\ncannot be performed remotely, and other\nU.S.-based associates in roles instrumental to\nmaintaining essential customer support. We\ncontinue to monitor and revise our safety\nprecautions and policies at banking locations\nas government authorities continue to\nimplement and modify measures to contain the\nfurther spread of COVID-19. In our Retail\nBanking business, we have re-opened nearly all\nof our cafes and branches across our network\nwith increased safety precautions. We will\ncontinue to monitor local conditions to ensure\nthe safety of our associates and customers\nwhile providing critical banking services.\n\nWe continue to offer a range of policies and\nprograms to accommodate customer hardship\nacross our lines of business. In our Credit\nCard and Auto Finance businesses, our\ncustomers can seek forbearance primarily in\nthe form of short-term payment deferrals or\nextensions and fee waivers. In our Retail\nBanking business, we are waiving select fees\nfor impacted customers and are offering short-\nterm payment deferrals for our small business\nbanking customers.

These allowance builds, in\ncombination with the adoption impact of the\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nstandard, increased our allowance coverage\nratio by 379 basis points to 6.50% as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 from 2.71% as of December\n31, 2019.

In our Domestic\nCard business, loan balances and revenue are\ndown year-over-year, while purchase volume was\nrelatively flat. In our Auto business, we saw\nan increase in origination volumes and loan\ngrowth from the sharp decline at the end of\nthe first quarter. Our loan growth was driven\nby our relationship strategy and digital\ncapabilities that we have developed. In our\nRetail Banking business, we have seen strong\ndeposit growth throughout the year from\nincreased consumer savings aided by the impact\nof government stimulus.\n\nWe are actively monitoring and responding to\ndevelopments across the myriad of landscapes\naffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including\nsocial, financial, legal, regulatory and\ngovernmental. As guidance is issued by\ngovernments and our regulators, we continue to\nassess the impacts on us. As government\nauthorities continue to implement, modify and\nreinstate social distancing and reopening\nplans and other measures to contain the\nfurther spread of COVID-19, we will continue\nto adjust our business operations, policies\nand practices, keeping the best interests of\nour associates, customers and business\npartners at the forefront.\n\nSee \u201cPart II\u2014Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period\nended March 31, 2020 for additional\ninformation regarding risks and the\nsignificant uncertainties relating to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n                                              \n  Cybersecurity Incident                      \n                                              \nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nWe retained a leading independent\ncybersecurity firm that confirmed we correctly\nidentified and fixed the specific\nconfiguration vulnerability exploited in the\nCybersecurity Incident. We continue to invest\nsignificantly in cybersecurity and related\nrisk management activities and expect to make\nadditional investments as we continue to\nassess our cybersecurity program.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we incurred\n$13 million of incremental expenses related to\nthe remediation of and response to the\nCybersecurity Incident, offset by $7 million\nof insurance recoveries. To date, we have\nincurred $127 million of incremental expenses,\noffset by $67 million of insurance recoveries\npursuant to the cyber risk insurance coverage\nwe carry. These expenses mainly consist of\ncustomer notifications, credit monitoring,\ntechnology costs, and professional support. We\nexpect total incremental costs through the end\nof 2020 will be at the high end of the $100\nmillion to $150 million range previously\ndisclosed. We carry insurance to cover certain\ncosts associated with a cyber risk event. As\nthe timing of recognizing insurance\nreimbursements may differ from the timing of\nrecognizing the associated expenses, any such\nreimbursements are not considered in this\nrange, though we continue to expect that a\nsignificant portion of these expenses will be\ncovered by insurance. This insurance has a\ntotal coverage limit of $400 million and is\nsubject to a $10 million deductible, which was\nmet in the third quarter of 2019, as well as\nstandard exclusions.\n\nWe continue to treat these expenses and\ninsurance reimbursements as adjusting items as\nthey relate to our financial results (\u201cCyber\nAdjusting Items\u201d). Our reported results\nexcluding adjusting items, including the Cyber\nAdjusting Items, represent non-GAAP measures\nwhich we believe help users of our financial\ninformation understand the impact of these\nadjusting items on our reported results as\nwell as provide an alternate measurement of\nour operating performance.\n                                              \n  6    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAlthough the ultimate magnitude and timing of\nexpenses or other impacts to our business or\nreputation related to the Cybersecurity\nIncident are uncertain, they may be\nsignificant, and some of the costs may not be\ncovered by insurance. However, we do not\nbelieve that this incident will materially\nimpact our strategy or our long-term financial\nhealth.

Interest-earning\nassets include loans, investment securities\nand other interest-earning assets, while our\ninterest-bearing liabilities include interest-\nbearing deposits, securitized debt\nobligations, senior and subordinated notes,\nother borrowings and other interest-bearing\nliabilities. Generally, we include in interest\nincome any past due fees on loans that we deem\ncollectible. Our net interest margin, based on\nour consolidated results, represents the\ndifference between the yield on our interest-\nearning assets and the cost of our interest-\nbearing liabilities, including the notional\nimpact of non-interest-bearing funding. We\nexpect net interest income and our net\ninterest margin to fluctuate based on changes\nin interest rates and changes in the amount\nand composition of our interest-earning assets\nand interest-bearing liabilities.\n                                              \n  13    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 2 below presents the average outstanding\nbalance, interest income earned, interest\nexpense incurred and average yield for the\nthird quarter and first nine months of 2020\nand 2019 for each major category of our\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities.

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a segment, such as management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio and\nasset/liability management by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and residual tax\nexpense or benefit to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate that is not\nassessed to our primary business segments, are\nincluded in the Other category.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenue and expenses directly or\nindirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation process is\nunique to each business segment and acquired\nbusiness. We regularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d in\nour 2019 Form 10-K.\n\nWe refer to the business segment results\nderived from our internal management\naccounting and reporting process as our\n\u201cmanaged\u201d presentation, which differs in some\ncases from our reported results prepared based\non U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore,\nthe managed presentation of our business\nsegment results may not be comparable to\nsimilar information provided by other\nfinancial services companies. In addition, our\nindividual business segment results should not\nbe used as a substitute for comparable results\ndetermined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nWe summarize our business segment results for\nthe third quarter and first nine months of\n2020 and 2019 and provide a comparative\ndiscussion of these results, as well as\nchanges in our financial condition and credit\nperformance metrics as of September 30, 2020\ncompared to December 31, 2019.

Net interest income\ndecreased by $304 million to $10.4 billion in\nthe first nine months of 2020 primarily driven\nby lower margins, partially offset by growth\nin our domestic credit card loan portfolio,\nincluding the acquired Walmart portfolio.\n\n\u2022 Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income\nincreased by $143 million to $1.0 billion in\nthe third quarter of 2020 primarily driven by\nhigher revenues from card partnership\narrangements and a release in our U.K. PPI\nreserve in the current quarter compared to a\nbuild in the prior year quarter. Non-interest\nincome decreased by $89 million to $2.8\nbillion in the first nine months of 2020\nprimarily driven by lower net interchange fees\nfrom a decline in purchase volume, partially\noffset by higher revenues from card\npartnership arrangements.\n\n\u2022 Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for\ncredit losses decreased by $637 million to\n$450 million in the third quarter of 2020\nprimarily driven by an allowance release for\npartnership loans moved to held-for sale and\nlower loan balances. Provision for credit\nlosses increased by $3.5 billion to $7.1\nbillion in the first nine months of 2020\ndriven by allowance builds in the first and\nsecond quarters of 2020 due to expectations of\neconomic worsening as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic.\n\n\u2022 Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense\ndecreased by $357 million to $2.0 billion in\nthe third quarter of 2020 and decreased by\n$604 million to $6.2 billion in the first nine\nmonths of 2020 primarily driven by our\ndecision to decrease marketing spend in the\ncurrent economic environment.

We maintain an allowance\nfor credit losses that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\ninherent in our credit card, consumer banking\nand commercial banking loans held for\ninvestment as of each balance sheet date. We\nalso separately reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments that are not unconditionally\ncancellable. For all such loans and unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimate of expected\ncredit losses includes a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period of one year and\nthen reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses. We build our allowance for\ncredit losses and reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments through the provision for credit\nlosses, which is driven by charge-offs,\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses and\nchanges in the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\nwas $16.1 billion as of September 30, 2020 and\n$7.2 billion as of December 31, 2019.\n\nWe have an established process, using\nanalytical tools and management judgment, to\ndetermine our allowance for credit losses.\nEstablishing the allowance each quarter\ninvolves evaluating many factors including,\nbut not limited to, historical loss and\nrecovery experience, recent trends in\ndelinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings,\nthe impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of\ncollateral underlying secured loans, account\nseasoning, changes in our credit evaluation,\nunderwriting and collection management\npolicies, seasonality, credit bureau scores,\ncurrent general economic conditions, our\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future\neconomic conditions, changes in the legal and\nregulatory environment and uncertainties in\nforecasting and modeling techniques used in\nestimating our allowance for credit losses.\nKey factors that have a significant impact on\nour allowance for credit losses include\nassumptions about employment levels, home\nprices and the valuation of commercial\nproperties, automobiles and other collateral.\n\nWe have a governance framework intended to\nensure that our estimate of the allowance for\ncredit losses is appropriate. Our governance\nframework provides for oversight of methods,\nmodels, qualitative adjustments, process\ncontrols and results. At least quarterly,\nrepresentatives from the Finance and Risk\nManagement organizations review and assess our\nallowance methodologies, key assumptions and\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for\ncredit losses.\n\nGroups independent of our estimation functions\nparticipate in the review and validation\nprocess. Tasks performed by these groups\ninclude periodic review of the rationale for\nand quantification of inputs requiring\njudgment as well as adjustments to results.\n\nWe have a model policy, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which governs\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for estimating\ncredit losses. The Model Risk Office validates\nall models and requires ongoing monitoring of\ntheir performance.\n\nIn addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses, on a quarterly basis, we review and\nassess our estimate of expected losses related\nto unfunded lending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. The factors\nimpacting our assessment generally align with\nthose considered in our evaluation of the\nallowance for credit losses for the Commercial\nBanking business. Changes to the reserve for\nlosses on unfunded lending commitments are\nrecorded through the provision for credit\nlosses in the consolidated statements of\nincome and to other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n\nAlthough we examine a variety of externally\navailable data, as well as our internal loan\nperformance data, to determine our allowance\nfor credit losses and reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimation process is\nsubject to risks and uncertainties, including\na reliance on historical loss and trend\ninformation that may not be representative of\ncurrent conditions and indicative of future\nperformance as well as economic forecasts that\nmay not align with actual future economic\nconditions. Accordingly, our actual credit\nloss experience may not be in line with our\nexpectations. We provide additional\ninformation on the methodologies and key\nassumptions used in determining our allowance\nfor credit losses for each of our loan\nportfolio segments in \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d and changes\nin our allowance in \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for\nCredit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments.\u201d\n                                              \n  Finance Charge and Fee Reserve              \n                                              \nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare recorded in revenue when earned. Billed\nfinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare included in loans held for investment\nwhile unbilled finance charges and fees are\nincluded in interest receivable. We continue\nto accrue finance charges and fees on credit\ncard loans until the account is charged off.\nBilled finance charges and fees that are\ncharged-off are reflected as a reduction to\nrevenue.\n                                              \n  33    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nConcurrent with our adoption of the CECL\nstandard in the first quarter of 2020, we\nreclassified our finance charge and fee\nreserve of $462 million to our allowance for\ncredit losses, with a corresponding increase\nto credit card loans held for investment. We\nreview and assess the appropriateness of our\nfinance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly\nbasis. Our methodology for estimating the\nuncollectible portion of finance charges and\nfees is consistent with the methodology we use\nto estimate the allowance for credit losses on\nthe principal portion of our credit card loan\nreceivables.\n                                              \n  Asset Impairment                            \n                                              \nIn addition to our loan portfolio, we review\nother assets for impairment on a regular basis\nin accordance with applicable accounting\nguidance. This process requires significant\nmanagement judgment and involves various\nestimates and assumptions.\n                                              \n  Goodwill                                    \n                                              \nWe perform our goodwill impairment test\nannually on October 1 at a reporting unit\nlevel. As of our last annual test and as of\nSeptember 30, 2020, we had four reporting\nunits which included Credit Card, Auto\nFinance, Other Consumer Banking and Commercial\nBanking. We are also required to test goodwill\nfor impairment when a triggering event occurs\nthat indicates it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is below\nits carrying amount. The macroeconomic,\nindustry and market factors previously\nidentified in the first quarter of 2020\ncoinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic have\npersisted in both the second and third\nquarters as there continued to be disruption\nin the economy and interest rates remain low.\nWe determined it was more likely than not that\nthe fair value of our reporting units remained\nin excess of their carrying values as of\nSeptember 30, 2020. We will continue to\nmonitor developments regarding the COVID-19\npandemic and measures implemented in response\nto the COVID-19 pandemic, our market\ncapitalization, overall economic conditions\nand any other triggering events or\ncircumstances that may cause an impairment of\ngoodwill in the future.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted ASU\n2017-04, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other (Topic\n350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill\nImpairment and updated our critical accounting\npolicy for goodwill impairment. Historical\nguidance for goodwill impairment testing\nprescribed that the company must compare each\nreporting unit\u2019s carrying value to its fair\nvalue. If the carrying value exceeds fair\nvalue, an entity performs the second step,\nwhich assigns the reporting unit\u2019s fair value\nto its assets and liabilities, including\nunrecognized assets and liabilities, in the\nsame manner as required in purchase accounting\nto determine the impairment. This ASU\neliminates the second step. Under the new\nguidance, an impairment of a reporting unit\u2019s\ngoodwill is determined based on the amount by\nwhich the reporting unit\u2019s carrying value\nexceeds its fair value, limited to the amount\nof goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nThere have been no additional changes to our\ncritical accounting policies and estimates\ndescribed in our December 31, 2019 Form 10-K\nunder \u201cMD&A\u2014Critical Accounting Policies and\nEstimates.\u201d\n                                       \n  ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS  \n                                       \nAccounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as\nof September 30, 2020\n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                 The                          \n                 amendments                   \n                 in this ASU    This ASU is   \n                 provide        effective     \n  Reference      optional       from March    \n  Rate Reform    expedients     12, 2020      \n  ASU No.        and            through       \n  2020-04,       exceptions     December 31,  \n  Reference      for            2022 with     \n  Rate Reform    applying       early         \n  (Topic         generally      adoption as   \n  848):Facil\u2026    accepted       of January    \n  of the         accounting     1, 2020       \n  Effect of      principles     permitted.    \n  Reference      (GAAP) to      We are        \n  Rate Reform    contracts,     evaluating    \n  on             hedging        the expected  \n  Financial      relationsh\u2026    impact of     \n  Reporting      and other      and our       \n  Issued         transactio\u2026    operational   \n  March 2020     affected by    readiness     \n                 reference      for this      \n                 rate reform    ASU.          \n                 if certain                   \n                 criteria                     \n                 are met.                     \n                                This ASU is   \n                                effective     \n                                January 1,    \n  Income Tax                    2021 with     \n  Accounting                    early         \n  Simplifica\u2026                   adoption      \n  ASU No.                       permitted,    \n  2019-12,       Simplifies     using the     \n  Income         various        retrospecti\u2026  \n  Taxes          aspects of     modified      \n  (Topic         the            retrospecti\u2026  \n  740):Simpl\u2026    guidance on    and           \n  the            accounting     prospective   \n  Accounting     for income     methods of    \n  for Income     taxes.         adoption.     \n  Taxes                         We are        \n  Issued                        currently     \n  December                      evaluating    \n  2019                          the impact    \n                                of adopting   \n                                this          \n                                standard.     \n                                              \nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d for information on the accounting\nstandards we adopted in 2020.\n                                              \n  34    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                      \n  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  \n                      \nThe level and composition of our capital are\ndetermined by multiple factors, including our\nconsolidated regulatory capital requirements\nand internal risk-based capital assessments\nsuch as internal stress testing and economic\ncapital.

Moreover, the\nBanks, as insured depository institutions, are\nsubject to Prompt Corrective Action (\u201cPCA\u201d)\ncapital regulations.\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rule includes the \u201cBasel\nIII Standardized Approach\u201d and the \u201cBasel III\nAdvanced Approaches.\u201d We entered parallel run\nunder Basel III Advanced Approaches on January\n1, 2015, during which we were required to\ncalculate capital ratios under both the Basel\nIII Standardized Approach and the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches, though we used the\nStandardized Approach for purposes of meeting\nregulatory capital requirements.\n\nIn October 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies\namended the Basel III Capital Rule to provide\nfor tailored application of certain capital\nrequirements across different categories of\nbanking institutions (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). As a\nbank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nthat does not exceed any of the applicable\nrisk-based thresholds, we are a Category III\ninstitution under the Tailoring Rules. As\nsuch, we are no longer subject to the Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches and certain associated\ncapital requirements and have the option of\nexcluding certain elements of accumulated\nother comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our\nregulatory capital. Effective in the first\nquarter of 2020, we excluded certain elements\nof AOCI from our regulatory capital as\npermitted by the Tailoring Rules.\n\nIn July 2019, the Federal Banking Agencies\nfinalized certain changes in the Basel III\nCapital Rule for institutions not subject to\nthe Basel III Advanced Approaches, including\nCapital One (\u201cCapital Simplification Rule\u201d).\nThese changes, effective January 1, 2020,\ngenerally raise the threshold above which\ninstitutions subject to the Capital\nSimplification Rule must deduct certain assets\nfrom their common equity Tier 1 capital,\nincluding certain deferred tax assets,\nmortgage servicing assets, and investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions. While\nthe higher thresholds will not impact our\ncurrent capital levels, in stress scenarios\nthey may provide a benefit by enabling us to\ninclude more deferred tax assets in our common\nequity Tier 1 capital. The Tailoring Rules and\nCapital Simplification Rule have, taken\ntogether, decreased our capital requirements.\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rule requires banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of common equity\nTier 1 capital, above the regulatory minimum\nratios. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve\nissued a final rule to implement the stress\ncapital buffer requirement (\u201cStress Capital\nBuffer Final Rule\u201d). Pursuant to the Stress\nCapital Buffer Final Rule, which became\neffective in May 2020, the Federal Reserve\nwill use the results of its supervisory stress\ntest to determine the size of a banking\ninstitution\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement. In particular, a banking\ninstitution\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement will equal, subject to a floor of\n2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between\nthe banking institution\u2019s starting common\nequity Tier 1 capital ratio and its lowest\nprojected common equity Tier 1 capital ratio\nunder the severely adverse scenario of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test plus\n(ii) the ratio of the banking institution\u2019s\nprojected four quarters of common stock\ndividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters\nof the planning horizon) to the projected\nrisk-weighted assets for the quarter in which\nthe banking institution\u2019s projected common\nequity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nIn addition, Category III institutions,\nincluding the Company and the Banks, are\nsubject to certain capital requirements\nformerly applicable only to Basel III Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations. Category III\ninstitutions are subject to a supplementary\nleverage ratio of 3.0% and their capital\nconservation buffer may be supplemented by an\nincremental countercyclical capital buffer of\nup to 2.5% composed of common equity Tier 1\ncapital and set at the discretion of the\nFederal Banking Agencies. As of September 30,\n2020, the countercyclical capital buffer was\nzero percent in the United States. A\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Banking\nAgencies set an earlier effective date.\n                                              \n  35    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nThe Market Risk Rule requires institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading portfolios. As of September 30,\n2020, the Company and CONA are subject to the\nMarket Risk Rule. See \u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk\nProfile\u201d below for additional information.\n\nAs part of the response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted\na final rule (\u201c2020 CECL Transition Rule\u201d)\nthat provides banking organizations an\noptional five-year transition period to phase\nin the impact of CECL on regulatory capital\n(the \u201c2020 CECL Transition Election\u201d).\n\nPursuant to the 2020 CECL Transition Rule,\nbanking organizations may elect to delay for\ntwo years the estimated impact of CECL on\nregulatory capital and then phase in the\nestimated cumulative impact of the initial\ntwo-year delay over the next three years. The\nestimated cumulative impact of CECL, which\nwill be phased in during the three-year\ntransition period, includes the after-tax\nimpact of adopting the CECL standard and the\nestimated impact of CECL in the initial two\nyears thereafter. The 2020 CECL Transition\nRule introduced a uniform \u201cscaling factor\u201d of\n25% for estimating the impact of CECL during\nthe initial two years. The 25% \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d is an approximation of the impact of\ndifferences in credit loss allowances\nreflected under the CECL standard versus the\nincurred loss methodology. We made the 2020\nCECL Transition Election in the first quarter\nof 2020, and therefore the applicable amounts\npresented in this Report reflect such\nelection.\n\nAs of September 30, 2020, the minimum capital\nrequirements plus the capital conservation\nbuffer of 2.5% and the countercyclical capital\nbuffer (currently set as 0%) for common equity\nTier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total\ncapital ratios were 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%,\nrespectively, for the Company and the Banks. A\ncommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1\ncapital ratio, or total capital ratio below\nthe applicable regulatory minimum ratio plus\nthe applicable capital conservation buffer and\nthe applicable countercyclical buffer (if set\nto an amount greater than 0%) might restrict a\nbanking organization\u2019s ability to distribute\ncapital and make discretionary bonus payments.\n\nUnder the stress capital buffer framework, our\nnew \u201cstandardized approach capital\nconservation buffer\u201d includes the stress\ncapital buffer requirement, the\ncountercyclical capital buffer and any G-SIB\nsurcharge. Our stress capital buffer\nrequirement is 5.6% for the period from\nOctober 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, at\nwhich point a revised stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be applicable to us based on\nour 2021 stress testing results, the\ncountercyclical capital buffer is currently\nset at 0%, and the G-SIB surcharge is not\napplicable to us . Therefore, the Company\u2019s\nminimum capital requirements plus the\nstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier\n1 capital and total capital ratios under the\nstress capital buffer framework are 10.1%,\n11.6% and 13.6%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2020 through September 30,\n2021. If we fail to maintain our capital\nratios above the minimum capital requirements\nplus the standardized approach capital\nconservation buffer, we will face increasingly\nstrict limitations on capital distributions\nand discretionary bonus payments to certain\nexecutive officers.\n\nThe Company exceeded the minimum capital\nrequirements and each of the Banks exceeded\nthe minimum regulatory requirements and were\nwell capitalized under PCA requirements as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n\nFor the description of the regulatory capital\nrules we are subject to, see \u201cMD&A\u2014Supervision\nand Regulation\u201d in this Report and our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period\nended March 31, 2020 as well as \u201cPart I\u2014Item\n1.

We resubmitted our updated capital plan\non November 2, 2020.\n\nPursuant to the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital plan\nrule, a participating banking organization,\nsuch as us, is prohibited from making capital\ndistributions without the prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve following an event\nrequiring the resubmission of its capital\nplan. Specifically for the third quarter of\n2020, the Federal Reserve required all\nparticipating banking organizations, including\nus, to preserve capital by suspending share\nrepurchases and capping common stock dividend\npayments to the lower of (i) the amount paid\nin the second quarter of 2020 and (ii) an\namount equal to the average net income across\nthe four preceding calendar quarters.\nScheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and\nTier 2 capital instruments, such as preferred\nstock and subordinated debt, were not\nsimilarly restricted.\n\nOn September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nannounced the extension of capital\ndistribution restrictions through the fourth\nquarter of 2020 to ensure that large banking\norganizations maintain a high level of capital\nresilience. Specifically, for the fourth\nquarter of 2020, banking organizations with\nmore than $100 billion in total assets,\nincluding us, continue to be required by the\nFederal Reserve to suspend share repurchases\nand to cap common stock dividends.\n\nWe suspended our 2019 Stock Repurchase Program\non March 13, 2020 in response to the COVID-19\npandemic through the program\u2019s expiration at\nthe end of the second quarter of 2020.\n\nConsistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nlimitations on common stock dividend payments\nas described above, we reduced our quarterly\ndividend on our common stock from $0.40 per\nshare to $0.10 per share for the third quarter\nof 2020.\n                                              \n  38    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWhile our third quarter results would have\npermitted us to increase our common stock\ndividend pursuant to the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nlimitations described above, we decided to\nmaintain our quarterly dividend at $0.10 per\nshare in the fourth quarter of 2020 as the\nprocess surrounding our resubmitted capital\nplan has not yet completed.\n\nFor the description of the regulatory capital\nplanning rules we are subject to, see\n\u201cMD&A\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u201d in this\nReport and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the period ended March 31, 2020 as well as\n\u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.

We expect\nthis redemption will reduce net income\navailable to common shareholders by\napproximately $17 million in the fourth\nquarter of 2020 and will reduce our Tier 1\ncapital ratio by an estimated 17 basis points.\n                                              \n  39    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases         \n                                              \nIn the first nine months of 2020, we declared\nand paid common stock dividends of $417\nmillion, or $0.90 per share, and preferred\nstock dividends of $212 million.

As\na BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely\ndependent upon the receipt of dividends or\nother payments from our subsidiaries. The\nBanks are subject to regulatory restrictions\nthat limit their ability to transfer funds to\nour BHC. As of September 30, 2020, funds\navailable for dividend payments from COBNA and\nCONA were $2.3 billion and $917 million,\nrespectively. There can be no assurance that\nwe will declare and pay any dividends to\nstockholders.\n\nConsistent with our 2019 Stock Repurchase\nProgram which was announced on June 27, 2019,\nour Board of Directors authorized the\nrepurchase of up to $2.2 billion of shares of\ncommon stock beginning in the third quarter of\n2019 through the end of the second quarter of\n2020. During the first quarter of 2020, we\nrepurchased approximately $312 million of\nshares of our common stock under the 2019\nStock Repurchase Program before suspending\nfurther repurchases on March 13, 2020 in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic through the\nprogram's expiration at the end of the second\nquarter of 2020. As noted above, for the third\nquarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve required\nall participating banking organizations,\nincluding us, to suspend share repurchases as\na measure of capital preservation.\n\nThe timing and exact amount of any future\ncommon stock repurchases will depend on\nvarious factors, including regulatory\napproval, market conditions, opportunities for\ngrowth, our capital position and the amount of\nretained earnings. Our stock repurchase\nprogram does not include specific price\ntargets, may be executed through open market\npurchases or privately negotiated\ntransactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1\nprograms, and may be suspended at any time.\nFor additional information on dividends and\nstock repurchases, see \u201cMD&A\u2014Capital\nManagement\u2014Capital Planning and Regulatory\nStress Testing\u201d and \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation\u2014Dividends,\nStock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds\u201d in\nour 2019 Form 10-K.\n                                              \n  40    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                   \n  RISK MANAGEMENT  \n                   \n                                              \n   Risk Management Framework                  \n                                              \nOur Risk Management Framework (the\n\u201cFramework\u201d) sets consistent expectations for\nrisk management across the Company. It also\nsets expectations for our \u201cThree Lines of\nDefense\u201d model, which defines the roles,\nresponsibilities and accountabilities for\ntaking and managing risk across the Company.\nAccountability for overseeing an effective\nFramework resides with our Board of Directors\neither directly or through its committees.\n\nThe \u201cFirst Line of Defense\u201d consists of any\nline of business or function that is\naccountable for risk taking and is responsible\nfor: (i) engaging in activities designed to\ngenerate revenue or reduce expenses; (ii)\nproviding operational support or servicing to\nany business function for the delivery of\nproducts or services to customers; or (iii)\nproviding technology services in direct\nsupport of first line business areas. Each\nline of business or first line function is\nresponsible for managing the risks associated\nwith their activities, including identifying,\nassessing, measuring, monitoring, controlling,\nand reporting the risks within its business\nactivities, consistent with the risk\nframework. The \u201cSecond Line of Defense\u201d\nconsists of two types of functions:\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d) and\nSupport Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking\nactivities and assesses risks and issues\nindependent from the first line of defense.\nSupport Functions are centers of specialized\nexpertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting,\nLegal) that provide support services to the\nCompany. The \u201cThird Line of Defense\u201d is\ncomprised of the Internal Audit and Credit\nReview functions. The third line provides\nindependent and objective assurance to senior\nmanagement and to the Board of Directors that\nthe first and second lines of defense have\nsystems and governance processes which are\nwell-designed and working as intended, and\nthat the Framework is appropriate for our\nsize, complexity and risk profile.\n\nOur Framework consists of the following nine\nelements:\n                                              \n  Govern\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Accoun\u2026                                     \n  Strate\u2026                                     \n  and                                         \n  Risk                                        \n  Alignm\u2026                                     \n             Assessm\u2026    Monitor\u2026    Aggreg\u2026  \n  Risk       Measure\u2026    and         Report\u2026  \n  Identi\u2026    and         Testing     and      \n             Response                Escala\u2026  \n  Capital                                     \n  and                                         \n  Liquid\u2026                                     \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n  (inclu\u2026                                     \n  Stress                                      \n  Testin\u2026                                     \n  Risk                                        \n  Data                                        \n  and                                         \n  Enabli\u2026                                     \n  Techno\u2026                                     \n  Culture                                     \n  and                                         \n  Talent                                      \n  Manage\u2026                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  41    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe provide additional discussion of our risk\nmanagement principles, roles and\nresponsibilities, framework and risk appetite\nunder \u201cMD&A\u2014Risk Management\u201d in our 2019 Form\n10-K.\n                                              \n  Risk Categories                             \n                                              \nWe apply our Framework to protect the Company\nfrom the major categories of risk that we are\nexposed to through our business activities.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n                                              \n  45    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 22 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019.\n                                              \n  Table 22: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of           September         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     30, 2020         31, 2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             69  %            67  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or              31               33     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             46  %            48  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660           20               20     \n  620 or              34               32     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

We\ncharge off loans as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses when we determine\nthe loan is uncollectible and record\nsubsequent recoveries of previously charged\noff amounts as increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Uncollectible finance charges\nand fees are reversed through revenue and\ncertain fraud losses are recorded in other\nnon-interest expense. Generally, costs to\nrecover charged-off loans are recorded as\ncollection expenses as incurred and included\nin our consolidated statements of income as a\ncomponent of other non-interest expense. Our\ncharge-off policy for loans varies based on\nthe loan type. See \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d for\ninformation on our charge-off policy for each\nof our loan categories.\n\nTable 27 presents our net charge-off amounts\nand rates, by portfolio segment, in the third\nquarter and first nine months of 2020 and\n2019.\n                                              \n  Table 27: Net Charge-Offs                   \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Net charge-off rates are calculated by\ndividing annualized net charge-offs by average\nloans held for investment for the period for\neach loan category.\n                                              \n  49    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nCOVID-19 Customer Assistance Programs and Loan\nModifications\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nFederal Banking Agencies supported banking\norganizations that are taking actions to\nassist customers in a prudent, safe and sound\nmanner, including through loan modifications.\nAs part of our response to the COVID-19\npandemic, we are offering programs to\naccommodate customer hardship across our lines\nof business.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card\n\nFor our domestic card customers excluding\ncertain retail partnership portfolios, we are\ncurrently offering a one-month payment\ndeferral program with an option to renew and\nfee waivers. Card loans enrolled in the\ndeferral program continue to accrue interest.\nTheir delinquency status is generally frozen\nat the time of enrollment and upon exiting the\nprogram, resumes to the status at the time of\nenrollment. Through September 30, 2020,\nexcluding certain retail partnership\nportfolios, a total of 2.4% of active accounts\nrepresenting $3.4 billion of loans outstanding\nhave received a payment deferral at any time\nthrough this program (including those who are\nno longer enrolled). Approximately 91% of\nthese customers were current at the time of\ntheir first enrollment. As of September 30,\n2020, approximately 0.1% of active accounts,\nrepresenting $247 million of loans\noutstanding, have been approved to skip their\nupcoming payment and have not made that\npayment.\n\nFor our international card customers, we also\noffer short-term payment deferrals and fee\nwaivers. Loans enrolled in the deferral\nprogram continue to accrue interest. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, $62 million of loans were\nenrolled in this program.\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking\n\nFor our auto customers, we are currently\noffering short-term payment extensions with an\noption to renew and fee waivers. Auto loans\nenrolled in short-term payment extensions\ncontinue to accrue interest. The contractual\nterm of the loan is extended by the length of\nthe short-term payment extension and the\ndelinquency status is updated to reflect the\nrevised terms of the loan. For customers that\nwere delinquent at the time of enrollment,\ntheir delinquency status is reduced\ncommensurate with the length of the short-term\npayment extension. Through September 30, 2020,\na total of 16.1% of accounts representing\n$11.7 billion of loans outstanding have\nreceived a short-term payment extension at any\ntime through this program (including those who\nare no longer enrolled). Approximately 74% of\nthese customers were current at the time of\ntheir first enrollment. As of September 30,\n2020, approximately 1% of accounts,\nrepresenting $686 million of loans\noutstanding, have been approved to skip their\nupcoming payment and have not made that\npayment.\n\nFor our retail banking customers, we are\ncurrently offering fee waivers and short-term\npayment deferrals. We also offer PPP loans to\nour small business banking customers. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, $44 million of loans were\nenrolled in the short-term payment deferral\nprogram and $966 million of PPP loans were\noutstanding.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking\n\nFor our commercial banking customers, our\nofferings are more customized, but generally\ninclude short-term payment deferrals.\nPerforming loans enrolled in short-term\npayment deferrals continue to accrue interest,\nand principal and interest are due at\nmaturity. Loans remain in their delinquency\nstatus as of their modification date through\nthe deferment period.

The effective\ninterest rate in effect immediately prior to\nthe loan modification is used as the effective\ninterest rate for purposes of measuring\nimpairment using the present value of expected\ncash flows. If the customer does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then the\ncredit card loan agreement may revert to its\noriginal payment terms, generally resulting in\nany loan outstanding reflected in the\nappropriate delinquency category and charged\noff in accordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, an interest rate reduction or\nprincipal reduction, or a combination of these\nconcessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\nrecorded investment.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of loans modified in TDRs receive an\nextension, with a portion of these loans\nreceiving an interest rate reduction or a\ngross balance reduction. The impairment on\nmodified commercial loans is generally\ndetermined based on the underlying collateral\nvalue.\n\nWe provide additional information on modified\nloans accounted for as TDRs, including the\nperformance of those loans subsequent to\nmodification, in \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans.\u201d\n                                              \n  51    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance.

There is no\nlimit under this shelf registration to the\namount or number of such securities that we\nmay offer and sell, subject to market\nconditions. In addition, we also maintain a\nshelf registration that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $25 billion\nof securitized debt obligations from our\ncredit card loan securitization trust and a\nshelf registration that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $20 billion\nfrom our auto loan securitization trusts.\n\nIn addition to our issuance capacity under the\nshelf registration statements, we also have\naccess to FHLB advances and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The ability to borrow\nutilizing these sources is based on membership\nstatus and the amount is dependent upon the\nBanks\u2019 ability to post collateral. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, we pledged both loans and\nsecurities to FHLB to secure a maximum\nborrowing capacity of $16.2 billion, of which\n$16.1 billion was still available to us to\nborrow. Our FHLB membership is supported by\nour investment in FHLB stock of $30 million\nand $328 million as of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, respectively, which was\ndetermined in part based on our outstanding\nadvances. As of September 30, 2020, we pledged\nloans to secure a borrowing capacity of $21.0\nbillion under the Federal Reserve Discount\nWindow. Our membership with the Federal\nReserve is supported by our investment in\nFederal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3\nbillion as of both September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019.\n                                              \n  Funding                                     \n                                              \nOur primary source of funding comes from\ndeposits, as they are a stable and relatively\nlow cost source of funding.

In\naddition to our existing assets and\nliabilities, we incorporate expected future\nbusiness growth assumptions, such as loan and\ndeposit growth and pricing, and plans for\nprojected changes in our funding mix in our\nbaseline forecast. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\nprojected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we\nassume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel\nshift in the level of interest rates detailed\nin Table 35 below. At the current level of\ninterest rates, our interest rate sensitive\nrevenue is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate\nscenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward\nshocks has increased relative to December 2019\nmainly due to the decline in interest rates\nand the growth in deposits and cash.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity                    \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact on the net\npresent value of our assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivative exposures, resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Key\nassumptions used in the calculation include\nprojecting rate sensitive prepayments for\nmortgage securities, loans and other assets,\nterm structure modeling of interest rates,\ndiscount spreads, and deposit volume and\npricing assumptions. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\neconomic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n35 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity increases in higher\nrate scenarios and decreases in lower interest\nrate scenarios. Similar to the changes in net\ninterest income sensitivity, our current\neconomic value of equity sensitivity to upward\nshocks has also increased since December 2019\nmainly due to the decline in interest rates\nand the growth in deposits and cash.\n\nTable 35 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand economic value of equity calculated under\nthe methodology described above as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. In\ninstances where a declining interest rate\nscenario would result in a rate less than 0%,\nwe assume a rate of 0% for that scenario.\n                                              \n  59    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   Table 35: Interest Rate Sensitivity        \n   Analysis                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n               September         December     \n                30, 2020         31, 2019     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  projected                                   \n  baseline                                    \n  net                                         \n  interest                                    \n  income:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis              7.3  %           1.8  %  \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis              5.3              1.3     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis          2.7              1.1     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis         -0.7             -0.5     \n  points                                      \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  economic                                    \n  value of                                    \n  equity:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis             10.8             -3.6     \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis             10.1              0.5     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis          6.3              0.8     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis        -11.6             -2.4     \n  points                                      \n                                              \nIn addition to these industry standard\nmeasures, we also consider the potential\nimpact of alternative interest rate scenarios,\nsuch as stressed rate shocks as well as\nsteepening and flattening yield curve\nscenarios in our internal interest rate risk\nmanagement decisions.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments. Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on the existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cNote 8\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities.\u201d\n                                              \n  Foreign Exchange Risk                       \n                                              \nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to\nchanges in the values of current holdings and\nfuture cash flows denominated in other\ncurrencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in the pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and\nthe Canadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to\nour businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nintercompany funding outstanding was 430\nmillion GBP and 761 million GBP as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively, and 5.2 billion CAD and 6.6\nbillion CAD as of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, respectively.

We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 1.6 billion\nGBP as of both September 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019, and 1.4 billion CAD as of both\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ an\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal.

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nestablished the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a group of private market\nparticipants and ex-officio members\nrepresenting banking and financial sector\nregulators. The ARRC has recommended the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as\nthe preferred alternative rate for certain\nU.S. dollar derivative and cash instruments.\nWhile the ARRC has recommended SOFR as the\nreplacement rate for LIBOR, there is\nacknowledgment that the development of a\ncredit-sensitive element could be a complement\nto SOFR. It is unclear as to the likelihood\nand timing, but such a development would have\nimpacts to our transition efforts.\n\nWe have exposures to LIBOR, including loans,\nderivative contracts, unsecured debt,\nsecuritizations, vendor agreements and other\ninstruments with attributes that are either\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. To\nfacilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR,\nwe have established a company-wide, cross-\nfunctional initiative to oversee and manage\nour transition away from LIBOR and other\nInterbank Offered Rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d) to\nalternative reference rates.

Specifically, for the fourth\nquarter of 2020, banking organizations with\nmore than $100 billion in total assets,\nincluding us, continue to be required by the\nFederal Reserve to suspend share repurchases\nand to cap common stock dividends.\n\nIn August 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies\nadopted as final the interim final rule issued\nin March 2020 that revised the definition of\n\u201celigible retained income\u201d in the capital rule\nto make any required reduction in capital\ndistributions less sudden and severe and more\ngradual than would have occurred under the\noriginal definition of the term.

The Basel III Capital Rule modified\nthe Advanced Approaches version of Basel II to\ncreate the Basel III Advanced Approaches.\n\nBasel III Capital Rule: The Federal Banking\nAgencies issued a rule in July 2013\nimplementing the Basel III capital framework\ndeveloped by the Basel Committee as well as\ncertain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital\nprovisions.\n\nBasel III Standardized Approach: The Basel III\nCapital Rule modified Basel I to create the\nBasel III Standardized Approach, which\nrequires for Basel III Advanced Approaches\nbanking organizations that have yet to exit\nparallel run to use the Basel III Standardized\nApproach to calculate regulatory capital,\nincluding capital ratios, subject to\ntransition provisions.\n\nCapital One or the Company: Capital One\nFinancial Corporation and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\nSecurity Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d): This was signed\ninto law on March 27, 2020, and among other\nprovisions, authorizes a number of lending\nprograms to support the flow of credit to\nconsumers and businesses.\n\nCarrying value (with respect to loans) : The\namount at which a loan is recorded on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. For loans\nrecorded at amortized cost, carrying value is\nthe unpaid principal balance net of\nunamortized deferred loan origination fees and\ncosts, and unamortized purchase premium or\ndiscount. For loans that are or have been on\nnonaccrual status, the carrying value is also\nreduced by any net charge-offs that have been\nrecorded and the amount of interest payments\napplied as a reduction of principal under the\ncost recovery method. For credit card loans,\nthe carrying value also includes interest that\nhas been billed to the customer, net of any\nrelated reserves.

1994 and\nheadquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) offer a broad\narray of financial products and services to\nconsumers, small businesses and commercial\nclients through digital channels, branches,\nCaf\u00e9s and other distribution channels. As of\nSeptember 30, 2020, our principal subsidiaries\nincluded:\n\u2022 Capital One Bank (USA), National Association\n(\u201cCOBNA\u201d), which offers credit and debit card\nproducts, other lending products and deposit\nproducts; and\n\u2022 Capital One, National Association (\u201cCONA\u201d),\nwhich offers a broad spectrum of banking\nproducts and financial services to consumers,\nsmall businesses and commercial clients.\nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d COBNA and CONA are\ncollectively referred to as the \u201cBanks.\u201d\nWe also offer products outside of the United\nStates of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) principally through\nCapital One (Europe) plc (\u201cCOEP\u201d), an indirect\nsubsidiary of COBNA organized and located in\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), and through a\nbranch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority,\namong other things, to provide credit card\nloans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has\nthe authority to provide credit card loans.\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into threemajor\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We\nprovide details on our business segments, the\nintegration of recent acquisitions, if any,\ninto our business segments and the allocation\nmethodologies and accounting policies used to\nderive our business segment results in \u201cNote\n12\u2014Business Segments and Revenue from\nContracts with Customers.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the U.S. (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d). The preparation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements in conformity with U.S.\nGAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin the consolidated financial statements and\nin the related disclosures. These estimates\nare based on information available as of the\ndate of the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile management makes its best judgments,\nactual amounts or results could differ from\nthese estimates. In the opinion of management,\nall normal, recurring adjustments have been\nincluded for a fair statement of this interim\nfinancial information. Certain prior period\namounts have been reclassified to conform to\nthe current period presentation.\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with\nthe audited consolidated financial statements,\nand related notes thereto, included in Capital\nOne Financial Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K (\u201c2019 Form 10-K\u201d).\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rates in the third quarter\nand first nine months of 2020 were computed\nutilizing the estimated annual effective tax\nrate method and were driven by the\nrelationship of our tax credits in proportion\nto our pre-tax earnings.\nSignificant Accounting Policies Impacted by\nour Adoption of the CECL Standard\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted ASU\nNo. 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (\u201cCECL\nstandard\u201d) and updated the below significant\naccounting policies.\n                                              \n  81    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nInvestment Securities\nWe classify securities as available for sale\nor held to maturity based on our investment\nstrategy and management\u2019s assessment of our\nintent and ability to hold the securities\nuntil maturity. We did not have any securities\nthat were classified as held to maturity as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.\nWe report securities available for sale on our\nconsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The\namortized cost of investment securities\nreflects the amount for which the security was\nacquired, adjusted for accrued interest,\namortization of premiums, discounts, and net\ndeferred fees and costs, collection of cash,\nand charge-offs. We elect to present accrued\ninterest for securities available for sale\nwithin interest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses are\nrecorded, net of tax, as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d). Unamortized premiums, discounts and\nother basis adjustments for available for sale\nsecurities are generally recognized in\ninterest income over the contractual lives of\nthe securities using the effective interest\nmethod. However, premiums on certain callable\ninvestment securities are amortized to the\nearliest call date. We record purchases and\nsales of investment securities available for\nsale on a trade date basis. Realized gains or\nlosses from the sale of debt securities are\ncomputed using the first-in first-out method\nof identification, and are included in non-\ninterest income in our consolidated statements\nof income.\nAn individual debt security is impaired when\nthe fair value of the security is less than\nits amortized cost. If we intend to sell an\navailable for sale security in an unrealized\nloss position or it is more likely than not\nthat we will be required to sell the security\nprior to recovery of its amortized cost basis,\nany allowance for credit losses is reversed\nthrough our provision for credit losses and\nthe difference between the amortized cost\nbasis of the security and its fair value is\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nFor impaired debt securities that we have both\nthe intent and ability to hold, the securities\nare evaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. The allowance for credit losses on our\ninvestment securities is recognized through\nour provision for credit losses and limited by\nthe unrealized losses of a security measured\nas the difference between the security\u2019s\namortized cost and fair value. See further\ndiscussion below under the \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses - Available for Sale Investment\nSecurities\u201d section of this Note.\nOur investment portfolio also includes certain\ndebt securities that, at the time of purchase,\nhad experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Such debt securities are\naccounted for in accordance with accounting\nguidance for purchased financial assets with\ncredit deterioration and are herein referred\nto as purchased credit-deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d)\nsecurities.\nPCD securities require the recognition of an\nallowance for credit losses at the time of\nacquisition. The allowance for credit losses\nis not recognized in earnings. Instead, the\npurchase price and the initial allowance\ncollectively represent the amortized cost\nbasis of a PCD security. Any noncredit\ndiscount or premium at the date of acquisition\nis amortized into interest income over the\nremaining life of the security. Subsequent to\nthe date of purchase, we re-measure the\nallowance for credit losses on the amortized\ncost basis using the same policies as for\nother debt securities available for sale and\nchanges are recognized through our provision\nfor credit losses. See further discussion\nbelow under the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses -\nAvailable for Sale Investment Securities\u201d\nsection of this Note.\nWe charge off any portion of an investment\nsecurity that we determine is uncollectible.\nThe amortized cost basis, excluding accrued\ninterest, is charged off through the allowance\nfor credit losses. Accrued interest is charged\noff as a reduction to interest income.\nRecoveries of previously charged off principal\namounts are recognized in our provision for\ncredit losses when received.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for\ninvestment, including loans underlying our\nconsolidated securitization trusts, and loans\nheld for sale and is divided into three\nportfolio segments: credit card, consumer\nbanking and commercial banking loans. Credit\ncard loans consist of domestic and\ninternational credit card loans. Consumer\nbanking loans consist of auto and retail\nbanking loans. Commercial banking loans\nconsist of commercial and multifamily real\nestate as well as commercial and industrial\nloans.\n                                              \n  82    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nLoan Classification\n\nUpon origination or purchase, we classify\nloans as held for investment or held for sale\nbased on our investment strategy and\nmanagement\u2019s intent and ability with regard to\nthe loans, which may change over time. The\naccounting and measurement framework for loans\ndiffers depending on the loan classification,\nwhether we elect the fair value option,\nwhether the loans are originated or purchased\nand whether purchased loans are considered to\nhave experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. The presentation within the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows is based\non management\u2019s intent at acquisition or\norigination. Cash flows related to loans that\nare acquired or originated with the intent to\nhold for investment are included in cash flows\nfrom investing activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Cash flows related\nto loans that are acquired or originated with\nthe intent to sell are included in cash flows\nfrom operating activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\nLoans Held for Investment\nLoans that we have the ability and intent to\nhold for the foreseeable future and loans\nassociated with consolidated securitization\ntransactions are classified as held for\ninvestment. Loans classified as held for\ninvestment, except for credit card loans, are\nreported at their amortized cost basis,\nexcluding accrued interest. For these loans,\nwe elect to present accrued interest within\ninterest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For credit card loans, billed\nfinance charges and fees are included in loans\nheld for investment. Unbilled finance charges\nand fees on credit card loans are included in\ninterest receivable.\n\nInterest income is recognized on performing\nloans held for investment on an accrual basis.\nWe defer loan origination fees and direct loan\norigination costs on originated loans,\npremiums and discounts on purchased loans and\nloan commitment fees. We recognize these\namounts in interest income as yield\nadjustments over the life of the loan and/or\ncommitment period using the effective interest\nmethod. For credit card loans, loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts are amortized on a straight-line basis\nover a 12-month period. The amortized cost of\nloans held for investment is subject to our\nallowance for credit losses methodology\ndescribed below under the \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses - Loans Held for Investment\u201d\nsection of this Note.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans purchased or originated with the intent\nto sell or for which we do not have the\nability and intent to hold for the foreseeable\nfuture are classified as held for sale.\nMultifamily commercial real estate loans\noriginated with the intent to sell to\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises are accounted\nfor under the fair value option. We elect the\nfair value option on these loans as part of\nour management of interest rate risk with\ncorresponding forward sale commitments. Loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts are recognized as incurred and are\nreported in other non-interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of income. Interest\nincome is calculated based on the loan's\nstated rate of interest and is reported in\ninterest income in the consolidated statements\nof income. Fair value adjustments are recorded\nin other non-interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of income.\n\nAll other loans classified as held for sale\nare recorded at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue. Loan origination fees, direct loan\norigination costs and any discounts and\npremiums are deferred until the loan is sold\nand are then recognized as part of the total\ngain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans\nheld for sale is determined on an aggregate\nportfolio basis for each loan type. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nIf a loan is transferred from held for\ninvestment to held for sale, then on the\ntransfer date, any decline in fair value\nrelated to credit is recorded as a charge-off\nand any allowance for credit losses is\nreversed through our provision for credit\nlosses. The loan is then reclassified to held\nfor sale at its amortized cost at the date of\nthe transfer. A valuation allowance is\nestablished, if needed, such that the loan\nheld for sale is recorded at the lower of cost\nor fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we\nreport write-downs or recoveries in fair value\nup to the carrying value at the date of\ntransfer and realized gains or losses on loans\nheld for sale in our consolidated statements\nof income as a component of other non-interest\nincome. We calculate the gain or loss on loan\nsales as the difference between the proceeds\nreceived and the carrying value of the loans\nsold, net of the fair value of any residual\ninterests retained.\nLoans Acquired\nAll purchased loans, including loans\ntransferred in a business combination, are\ninitially recorded at fair value, which\nincludes consideration of expected future\nlosses, as of the date of the acquisition. To\ndetermine the fair value of loans at\nacquisition, we\n                                              \n  83    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nestimate discounted contractual cash flows due\nusing an observable market rate of interest,\nwhen available, adjusted for factors that a\nmarket participant would consider in\ndetermining fair value. In determining fair\nvalue, contractual cash flows are adjusted to\ninclude prepayment estimates based upon\nhistorical payment trends, forecasted default\nrates and loss severities and other relevant\nfactors. The difference between the fair value\nand the contractual cash flows is recorded as\na loan premium or discount, which may relate\nto either credit or non-credit factors, at\nacquisition.\n\nWe account for purchased loans under the\naccounting guidance for purchased financial\nassets with credit deterioration when, at the\ntime of purchase, the loans have experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination. We also\naccount for loans under this guidance when the\nloans were previously accounted for under the\naccounting guidance for purchased credit\nimpaired loans and debt securities (\u201cPCI\u201d)\nprior to our adoption of Accounting Standards\nCodification (\u201cASC\u201d) 326, Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses , on January 1,\n2020. We refer to these loans which are\naccounted for under accounting guidance for\npurchased financial assets with more-than-\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination as \u201cPCD loans\u201d.\n\nWe recognize an allowance for credit losses on\npurchased loans that have not experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination at the time\nof purchase through earnings in a manner that\nis consistent with originated loans. The\npolicies relating to the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans is described below in the\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\u201d section of this Note.\nLoan Modifications and Restructurings\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide modifications to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty to improve\nlong-term collectability of the loan and to\navoid the need for foreclosure or repossession\nof collateral, if any. Our loan modifications\ntypically include short-term payment\ndeferrals, an extension of the loan term, a\nreduction in the interest rate, a reduction in\nthe loan balance, or a combination of these\nconcessions. A loan modification in which a\nconcession is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty is accounted\nfor and reported as a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d). See \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for\nadditional information on our loan\nmodifications and restructurings, including\nthose in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDelinquent and Nonperforming Loans\nThe entire balance of a loan is considered\ncontractually delinquent if the minimum\nrequired payment is not received by the first\nstatement cycle date equal to or following the\ndue date specified on the customer\u2019s billing\nstatement. Delinquency is reported on loans\nthat are 30or more days past due. Interest and\nfees continue to accrue on past due loans\nuntil the date the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, if applicable. For loan\nmodifications, delinquency and nonaccrual\nstatus are reported in accordance with the\nrevised terms of the loans. We generally place\nloans on nonaccrual status when we believe the\ncollectability of interest and principal is\nnot reasonably assured.\n\nNonperforming loans generally include loans\nthat have been placed on nonaccrual status. We\ndo not report loans classified as held for\nsale as nonperforming.\n\nOur policies for classifying loans as\nnonperforming, by loan category, are as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 Credit card loans: As permitted by\nregulatory guidance issued by the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council\n(\u201cFFIEC\u201d), our policy is generally to exempt\ncredit card loans from being classified as\nnonperforming, as these loans are generally\ncharged off in the period the account becomes\n180days past due. Consistent with industry\nconventions, we generally continue to accrue\ninterest and fees on delinquent credit card\nloans until the loans are charged off.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We classify consumer\nbanking loans as nonperforming when we\ndetermine that the collectability of all\ninterest and principal on the loan is not\nreasonably assured, generally when the loan\nbecomes 90days past due.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans : We classify\ncommercial banking loans as nonperforming as\nof the date we determine that the\ncollectability of all interest and principal\non the loan is not reasonably assured.\n                                              \n  84    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Modified loans and troubled debt\nrestructurings: Modified loans, including\nTDRs, that are current at the time of the\nrestructuring remain on accrual status if\nthere is demonstrated performance prior to the\nrestructuring and continued performance under\nthe modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the\nmodified loan is classified as nonperforming.\n\nInterest and fees accrued but not collected at\nthe date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status\nare reversed against earnings. In addition,\nthe amortization of deferred loan fees, costs,\npremiums and discounts is suspended. Interest\nand fee income are subsequently recognized\nonly upon the receipt of cash payments.\nHowever, if there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectability of loan principal,\ncash received is generally applied against the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status\nwhen all principal and interest is current and\nrepayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest is reasonably assured,\nor when the loan is both well-secured and in\nthe process of collection and collectability\nis no longer doubtful.\nCharge-Offs - Loans\nWe charge off loans when we determine that the\nloan is uncollectible. The amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, is charged\noff as a reduction to the allowance for credit\nlosses based on the time frames presented\nbelow. Accrued interest on loans other than\ncredit card loans determined to be\nuncollectible is reversed as a reduction of\ninterest income when the loan is classified as\nnonperforming. For credit card loans, accrued\ninterest is charged off simultaneously with\nthe charge off of other components of\namortized cost and as a reduction of interest\nincome. When received, recoveries of\npreviously charged off amounts are recorded as\nan increase to the allowance for credit losses\n(see the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note for\ninformation on how we account for expected\nrecoveries). Costs to recover charged off\nloans are recorded as collection expense and\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense as incurred. Our charge-off time\nframes by loan type are presented below.\n\n\u2022 Credit card loans : We generally charge off\ncredit card loans in the period the account\nbecomes 180days past due. We charge off\ndelinquent credit card loans for which\nrevolving privileges have been revoked as part\nof loan workout when the account becomes\n120days past due. Credit card loans in\nbankruptcy are generally charged off by the\nend of the month following 30days after the\nreceipt of a complete bankruptcy notification\nfrom the bankruptcy court. Credit card loans\nof deceased account holders are generally\ncharged off 5days after receipt of\nnotification.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We generally charge\noff consumer banking loans at the earlier of\nthe date when the account is a specified\nnumber of days past due or upon repossession\nof the underlying collateral. Our charge-off\nperiod for auto loans is 120days past due.\nSmall business banking loans generally charge\noff at 120days past due based on the date the\namortized cost basis is deemed uncollectible.\nAuto loans that have not been previously\ncharged off where the borrower has filed for\nbankruptcy and the loan has not been\nreaffirmed charge off in the period that the\nloan is 60days from the bankruptcy\nnotification date, regardless of delinquency\nstatus. Auto loans that have not been\npreviously charged off and have been\ndischarged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are\ncharged off at the end of the month in which\nthe bankruptcy discharge occurs. Remaining\nconsumer loans generally are charged off\nwithin 40days of receipt of notification from\nthe bankruptcy court. Consumer loans of\ndeceased account holders are charged off by\nthe end of the month following 60days of\nreceipt of notification.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans: We charge off\ncommercial loans in the period we determine\nthat the amortized cost basis is\nuncollectible.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\n(\u201callowance\u201d) that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\nover the contractual terms of our loans held\nfor investment and investment securities\nclassified as available for sale. We measure\nthe allowance on a quarterly basis through\nconsideration of past events, including\nhistorical experience, current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\nWe measure current expected credit losses over\nthe contractual terms of our loans. The\ncontractual terms are adjusted for expected\nprepayments but are not extended for renewals\nor extensions, except when an extension or\nrenewal arises from a borrower option that is\nnot unconditionally cancellable or through a\nTDR that is reasonably expected to occur.\n                                              \n  85    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe aggregate loans sharing similar risk\ncharacteristics into pools for purposes of\nmeasuring expected credit losses. Pools are\nreassessed periodically to confirm that all\nloans within each pool continue to share\nsimilar risk characteristics. Expected credit\nlosses for loans that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with other financial\nassets are measured individually.\n\nExpected recoveries of amounts previously\ncharged off or expected to be charged off are\nrecognized within the allowance, with a\ncorresponding reduction to our provision for\ncredit losses. At times expected recoveries\nmay result in a negative allowance. We limit\nthe allowance to amounts previously charged\noff and expected to be charged off. Charge-\noffs of uncollectible amounts result in a\nreduction to the allowance and recoveries of\npreviously charged off amounts result in an\nincrease to the allowance.\n\nWhen developing an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information, or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Significant judgment is\napplied to the development and duration of\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used in\nour estimation of lifetime losses. We estimate\nexpected credit losses over the duration of\nthose forecasts and then revert, on a rational\nand systematic basis, to historical losses at\neach relevant loss component of the estimate.\nExpected losses for contractual terms\nextending beyond the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast and reversion periods are\nbased on those historical losses.\n\nManagement will consider and may qualitatively\nadjust for conditions, changes and trends in\nloan portfolios that may not be captured in\nmodeled results. These adjustments are\nreferred to as qualitative factors and\nrepresent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses. Management\u2019s\njudgment may involve an assessment of current\nand forward-looking conditions including but\nnot limited to changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, nature and volume of the\nportfolio, external factors, and uncertainty\nas it relates to economic, model or forecast\nrisks, where not already captured in the\nmodeled results.\n\nExpected credit losses for collateral-\ndependent loans are based on the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral. When we intend to\nliquidate the collateral, the fair value of\nthe collateral is adjusted for expected costs\nto sell. A loan is deemed to be a collateral-\ndependent loan when (i) we determine\nforeclosure or repossession of the underlying\ncollateral is probable, or (ii) foreclosure or\nrepossession is not probable, but the borrower\nis experiencing financial difficulty and we\nexpect repayment to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the\ncollateral. The allowance for a collateral-\ndependent loan reflects the difference between\nthe loan\u2019s amortized cost basis and the fair\nvalue (less selling costs, where applicable)\nof the loan's underlying collateral.\n\nOur credit card and consumer banking loan\nportfolios consist of smaller-balance,\nhomogeneous loans. The consumer banking loan\nportfolio is divided into twoprimary portfolio\nsegments: auto loans and retail banking loans.\nThe credit card and consumer banking loan\nportfolios are further divided by our business\nunits into groups based on common risk\ncharacteristics, such as origination year,\ncontract type, interest rate, credit bureau\nscore and geography. The commercial banking\nloan portfolio is primarily composed of\nlarger-balance, non-homogeneous loans. These\nloans are subject to reviews that result in\ninternal risk ratings. In assessing the risk\nrating of a particular commercial banking\nloan, among the factors we consider are the\nfinancial condition of the borrower,\ngeography, collateral performance, historical\nloss experience and industry-specific\ninformation that management believes is\nrelevant in determining and measuring expected\ncredit losses. Subjective assessment and\ninterpretation are involved. Emphasizing one\nfactor over another or considering additional\nfactors could impact the risk rating assigned\nto that commercial banking loan.\n\nFor consumer banking and commercial banking\nloans, the contractual period typically does\nnot include renewals or extensions because the\nrenewals and extensions are generally not at\nthe borrower\u2019s exclusive option to exercise.\nManagement has determined that the undrawn\ncredit exposure that is associated with our\ncredit card loans is unconditionally\ncancellable. For this reason, expected credit\nlosses are measured based on the drawn balance\nat each quarterly measurement date, but not on\nthe undrawn exposure. Because credit card\nloans do not have a defined contractual life,\nmanagement estimates both the volume and\napplication of payments to determine a\ncontractual life of the drawn balance at the\nmeasurement date over which expected credit\nlosses are developed for credit card loans.\n                                              \n  86    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWith the exception of credit card loans, we\nhave made a policy election to not measure an\nallowance on accrued interest for loans held\nfor investment because we reverse\nuncollectible accrued interest in a timely\nmanner. See the \u201cDelinquent and Nonperforming\nLoans\u201d and \u201cCharge-Offs - Loans\u201d sections of\nthis Note for information on what we consider\ntimely. For credit card loans, we do not make\nthis election, as we reserve for uncollectible\naccrued interest relating to credit card loans\nin the allowance.\n\nThe allowance related to credit card and\nconsumer banking loans assessed on a pooled\nbasis is based on a modeled calculation, which\nis supplemented by management judgment as\ndescribed above. Because of the homogeneous\nnature of our consumer loan portfolios, the\nallowance is based on the aggregated portfolio\nsegment evaluations. The allowance is\nestablished through a process that begins with\nestimates of historical losses in each pool\nbased upon various statistical analyses, with\nadjustments for current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions, which includes expected economic\nconditions. Loss forecast models are utilized\nto estimate expected credit losses and\nconsider several portfolio indicators\nincluding, but not limited to, expected\neconomic conditions, historical loss\nexperience, account seasoning, the value of\ncollateral underlying secured loans, estimated\nforeclosures or defaults based on observable\ntrends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings,\nunemployment, credit bureau scores and general\nbusiness trends. Management believes these\nfactors are relevant in estimating expected\ncredit losses and also considers an evaluation\nof overall portfolio credit quality based on\nindicators such as changes in our credit\nevaluation, underwriting and collection\nmanagement policies, the effect of other\nexternal factors such as competition and legal\nand regulatory requirements, general economic\nconditions and business trends, and\nuncertainties in forecasting and modeling\ntechniques used in estimating our allowance.\n\nThe allowance related to commercial banking\nloans assessed on a pooled basis is based on\nour historical loss experience for loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics and consideration\nof the current credit quality of the\nportfolio, which is supplemented by management\njudgment as described above. These are\nadjusted for current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions likely to cause future losses which\nvary from historical levels. We apply internal\nrisk ratings to commercial banking loans,\nwhich we use to assess credit quality and\nderive a total loss estimate based on an\nestimated probability of default (\u201cdefault\nrate\u201d) and loss given default (\u201closs\nseverity\u201d). Management may also apply judgment\nto adjust the loss factors derived, taking\ninto consideration both quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including general\neconomic conditions, industry-specific and\ngeographic trends, portfolio concentrations,\ntrends in internal credit quality indicators,\nand current and past underwriting standards\nthat have occurred but are not yet reflected\nin the historical data underlying our loss\nestimates.\n\nThe allowance related to smaller-balance\nhomogeneous credit card and consumer banking\nloans whose terms have been modified in a TDR\nis calculated on a pool basis using historical\nloss experience, adjusted for current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of conditions likely to cause future\nlosses which vary from historical levels for\nthe respective class of assets. The allowance\nrelated to consumer banking loans that are\nassessed at a loan-level is determined based\non key considerations that include the\nborrower\u2019s overall financial condition,\nresources and payment history, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, and when applicable, the estimated\nrealizable value of any collateral. The\nallowance related to commercial banking loans\nthat are assessed at a loan-level is generally\ndetermined in accordance with our policy for\nestimating expected credit losses for\ncollateral-dependent loans as described above.\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures\nIn addition to the allowance, we also measure\nexpected credit losses related to unfunded\nlending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable in our Commercial\nBanking business. This reserve is measured\nusing the same measurement objectives as the\nallowance for loans held for investment and is\nrecorded within other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. These commitments\nare segregated by risk according to our\ninternal risk rating scale, which we use to\nassess credit quality and derive an expected\ncredit loss estimate. We assess these risk\nclassifications, taking into consideration\nboth quantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of conditions likely to\ncause future losses which vary from historical\nlevels, and utilization assumptions to\nestimate the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Expected credit losses are not\nmeasured on unfunded lending commitments that\nare unconditionally cancellable, including all\nof our unfunded credit card and consumer\nbanking lending commitments and certain of our\nunfunded commercial banking lending\ncommitments.\n                                              \n  87    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nDetermining the appropriateness of the\nallowance and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is complex and requires judgment\nby management about the effect of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. Subsequent\nevaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of\nthe factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments in future\nperiods. See \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments\u201d for additional information.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Available for\nSale Investment Securities\nWhen an investment security available for sale\nis impaired due to credit factors, we\nrecognize a provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and an\nallowance for credit losses on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Credit losses\nrecognized in the allowance for credit losses\nare limited to the amount by which the\ninvestment security\u2019s amortized cost basis\nexceeds its fair value. Investment securities\nin unrealized gain positions do not have an\nallowance for credit losses as the investment\nsecurity could be sold at its fair value to\nprevent realization of credit losses. We\nexclude accrued interest from the fair value\nand amortized cost basis of an investment\nsecurity for purposes of measuring impairment.\nCharge-offs of uncollectible amounts of\ninvestment securities are deducted from the\nallowance for credit losses.\n\nFor certain of our securities available for\nsale, we have determined that there is no risk\nof impairment due to credit factors. These\ninvestment securities include high quality\ndebt instruments that are issued and\nguaranteed by the United States government and\nits agencies or are issued through certain\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises. Management\nperforms periodic assessments to reevaluate\nthis conclusion by considering any changes in\nhistorical losses, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\n\nWe evaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at\nthe individual security level and determine\nwhether any portion of the decline in fair\nvalue is due to a credit loss. We make this\ndetermination through the use of quantitative\nand qualitative analyses. Our qualitative\nanalysis includes factors such as the extent\nto which fair value is less than amortized\ncost, any changes in the security\u2019s credit\nrating, past defaults or delayed payments, and\nadverse conditions impacting the security or\nissuer. A credit loss exists to the extent\nthat management does not expect to recover the\namortized cost basis.\n\nFor investment securities which require\nfurther assessment, we perform a quantitative\nanalysis using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology and compare the present value of\nexpected future cash flows from the security\navailable for sale to the security\u2019s amortized\ncost basis. Projected future cash flows\nreflect management\u2019s best estimate and are\nbased on our understanding of past events,\ncurrent conditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts, and are discounted by the\nsecurity\u2019s effective interest rate adjusted\nfor prepayments. The allowance for credit\nlosses for investment securities reflects the\ndifference by which the amortized cost basis\nexceeds the present value of future cash flows\nand is limited to the amount by which the\nsecurity\u2019s amortized cost exceeds its fair\nvalue. See \u201cNote 2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for\nadditional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest Income and Fees\nInterest income and fees on loans and\ninvestment securities are recognized based on\nthe contractual provisions of the underlying\narrangements.\nLoan origination fees and costs and premiums\nand discounts on loans held for investment are\ndeferred and generally amortized into interest\nincome as yield adjustments over the\ncontractual life and/or commitment period\nusing the effective interest method. Costs\ndeferred include direct origination costs such\nas bounties paid to third parties for new\naccounts and incentives paid to our network of\nauto dealers for loan referrals. In certain\ncircumstances, we elect to factor prepayment\nestimates into the calculation of the constant\neffective yield necessary to apply the\ninterest method. Prepayment estimates are\nbased on historical prepayment data, existing\nand forecasted interest rates, and economic\ndata. For credit card loans, loan origination\nfees and direct loan origination costs are\namortized on a straight-line basis over a\n12-month period.\nUnamortized premiums, discounts and other\nbasis adjustments on investment securities are\ngenerally recognized in interest income over\nthe contractual lives of the securities using\nthe effective interest method. However,\npremiums for certain callable investment\nsecurities are amortized to the earliest call\ndate.\n                                              \n  88    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare recorded in revenue when earned.

Agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities (\u201cCMBS\u201d)\nand other securities. Agency securities\ninclude Government National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d) guaranteed\nsecurities, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d)\nissued securities. The carrying value of our\ninvestments in U.S. Treasury and Agency\nsecurities represented 96% of our total\ninvestment securities portfolio as of both\nSeptember 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the\nCECL standard. For our purchased credit-\ndeteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d) securities, which are\nclassified as available for sale, this\nadoption resulted in an increase of their\namortized cost basis and related allowance for\ncredit losses. The allowance for credit losses\nfor these PCD securities is limited to the\namount by which the amortized cost basis of\nthe security exceeds its fair value. This\nlimitation resulted in an increase of $\n11million to our retained earnings with a\ncorresponding decrease in AOCI at adoption.\nWe exclude accrued interest receivable from\nthe amortized cost disclosed in this note. Our\ndisclosures below reflect these adoption\nchanges. Prior period presentation was not\nreclassified to conform to the current period\npresentation.

We present our\nauto loan portfolio by FICO scores at\norigination and our retail banking loan\nportfolio by delinquency status, which\nincludes all past due loans, both performing\nand nonperforming.\nTable 3.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by\nCredit Quality Indicator\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Amounts represent period-end loans held\nfor investment in each credit score category.\nAuto credit scores generally represent average\nFICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus\nat the time of application and are not\nrefreshed thereafter.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n                                              \n  96    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses for commercial loans. Generally,\nloans that are designated as criticized\nperforming and criticized nonperforming are\nreviewed quarterly by management to determine\nif they are appropriately classified/rated and\nwhether any impairment exists. Noncriticized\nloans are also generally reviewed, at least\nannually, to determine the appropriate risk\nrating. In addition, we evaluate the risk\nrating during the renewal process of any loan\nor if a loan becomes past due.\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019. The internal risk\nrating status includes all past due loans,\nboth performing and nonperforming.\nTable 3.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by\nInternal Risk Ratings\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n             %             %             %    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n                                              \n      $      \u2026      $      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n             \u2026             \u2026             \u2026    \n      $      \u2026      $      \u2026      $      \u2026    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Criticized exposures correspond to the\n\u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d and\n\u201cDoubtful\u201d asset categories defined by bank\nregulatory authorities.\n                                              \n  97    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n(2) Includes PPP loans of $ 242million as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.\nRevolving Loans Converted to Term Loans\nFor the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2020, we converted $ 250million and $\n499million of revolving loans to term loans,\nrespectively, primarily in our domestic credit\ncard and commercial banking loan portfolios.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nFederal Banking Agencies issued an interagency\nstatement that provides banking organizations\nwith additional guidance and relief on\naccounting for certain customer concessions\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpecifically, TDR accounting relief is\navailable for short-term modifications of\nloans that were not more than 30 days past due\nwhere concessions do not extend beyond six\nmonths.

Accordingly, our disclosures\nbelow reflect these adoption changes. Prior\nperiod presentation was not modified to\nconform to the current period presentation.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d for additional information.\nConcurrent with this adoption, we reclassified\nour finance charge and fee reserve to our\nallowance for credit losses, with a\ncorresponding increase to credit card loans\nheld for investment.\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. When developing an estimate of\nexpected credit losses, we use both\nquantitative and qualitative methods in\nconsidering all available information relevant\nto assessing collectability. This may include\ninternal information, external information, or\na combination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes, and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nSignificant judgment is applied in our\nestimation of lifetime credit losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019. The allowance\nbalance as of September 30, 2020 reflects the\ncumulative effects from adoption of the CECL\nstandard and the change to include finance\ncharge and fee reserve in the allowance for\ncredit losses. The reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments balance as of September\n30, 2020 also reflects the cumulative effects\nfrom adoption of the CECL standard, including\nthe component of loss sharing agreements with\nthe government-sponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d)\non multifamily commercial real estate loans\nthat are within the scope of the CECL\nstandard.\nWhen developing an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. Management will consider and\nmay make adjustments for qualitative factors,\nwhich represent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses. Our allowance\nfor credit losses increased by $ 8.9billion to\n$ 16.1billion as of September 30, 2020 from\nDecember 31, 2019, primarily driven by the\nallowance builds in the first and

that are presented within our\nconsolidated financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and provision for credit losses.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d in our 2019 Form 10-K

course of business, we enter\ninto various types of transactions with\nentities that are considered to be VIEs. Our\nprimary involvement with VIEs has been related\nto our securitization transactions in which we\ntransferred assets to securitization trusts.\nWe have primarily securitized credit card and\nauto loans, which have provided a source of\nfunding for us and enabled us to transfer a\ncertain portion of the economic risk of the\nloans or related debt securities to third\nparties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet our maximum remaining funding\nobligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nvariable interest, aggregated based on VIEs\nwith similar characteristics as of September\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. We separately\npresent information for consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       18       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       69       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       87       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  106    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026        7       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       69       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       76       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities owned by the VIE, which\nincludes the seller\u2019s interest and repurchased\nnotes held by other related parties.\n\n(2) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n631million of liabilities as of September 30,\n2020, and $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n741million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2019.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to securitization\ntrusts of GSEs. We retain the related Mortgage\nservicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service the\ntransferred loans pursuant to the guidelines\nset forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold\nprimarily RMBS, CMBS, and ABS in our\ninvestment securities portfolio, which\nrepresent variable interests in the respective\nsecuritization trusts from which those\nsecurities were issued. We exclude these VIEs\nfrom the tables within this note because we do\nnot consider our continuing involvement with\nthese VIEs to be significant as we either\ninvest in securities issued by the VIE and\nwere not involved in the design of the VIE or\nno transfers have occurred between the VIE and\nus.

Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritization involves the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nMortgage Securitizations\nWe had previously securitized mortgage loans\nby transferring these loans to securitization\ntrusts that had issued mortgage-backed\nsecurities to investors. These mortgage trusts\nconsist of option-adjustable rate mortgage\n(\u201coption-ARM\u201d) securitizations and\nsecuritizations from our discontinued\noperations which include the mortgage\norigination operations of our wholesale\nmortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage\nFunding, Inc. (\u201cGreenPoint\u201d) and the\nmanufactured housing operations of GreenPoint\nCredit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint\n(collectively \u201cGreenPoint securitizations\u201d).\nWe retain rights to certain future cash flows\narising from these securitizations. We do not\nconsolidate the mortgage securitizations\nbecause we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of the trusts, and the\nright to receive the benefits or the\nobligation to absorb losses that could\npotentially be significant to the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain of our investments in\n                                              \n  108    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nqualified affordable housing projects using\nthe proportional amortization method if\ncertain criteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2020 and 2019, we recognized\namortization of $ 428million and $ 417million\n, respectively, and tax credits of $ 47million\nand $ 516million, respectively, associated\nwith these investments within income tax\nprovision or benefit. The carrying value of\nour equity investments in these qualified\naffordable housing projects was $ 4.5billion\nand $ 4.4billion as of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, respectively. We are\nperiodically required to provide additional\nfinancial or other support during the period\nof the investments. Our liability for these\nunfunded commitments was $ 1.5billion as of\nboth September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nand is largely expected to be paid from 2020\nto 2022 .\n\nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.6billion as of both September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019. The creditors of the VIEs\nhave no recourse to our general credit and we\ndo not provide additional financial or other\nsupport other than during the period that we\nare contractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n10.8billion and $ 10.9billion as of September\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.0billion and $ 1.9billion as\nof September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively, are reflected on our\nconsolidated balance sheets in cash, loans\nheld for investment, and other assets. The\nliabilities are reflected in other\nliabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no\nrecourse to our general credit. We have not\nprovided additional financial or other support\nother than during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it.\n\nOther\n\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We were not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance. Our maximum exposure to these\nVIEs is limited to the investments on our\nconsolidated balance sheets of $ 466million\nand $ 502million as of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, respectively. The creditors\nof the other VIEs have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit. We have not provided\nadditional financial or other support other\nthan during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it.\n                                              \n  109    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  NOTE\u00a06\u2014GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  \n                                         \nThe table below presents our goodwill,\nintangible assets and MSRs as of September 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019.

We also\nuse a variety of other funding sources\nincluding short-term borrowings, senior and\nsubordinated notes, securitized debt\nobligations and other borrowings. In addition,\nwe utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by\ncertain portions of our loan and investment\nsecurities portfolios. Securitized debt\nobligations are presented separately on our\nconsolidated balance sheets, as they represent\nobligations of consolidated securitization\ntrusts, while federal funds purchased and\nsecurities loaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, senior and subordinated notes and\nother borrowings, including FHLB advances, are\nincluded in other debt on our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nOur total short-term borrowings generally\nconsist of federal funds purchased and\nsecurities loaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase and short-term FHLB advances. Our\nlong-term debt consists of borrowings with an\noriginal contractual maturity of greater than\none year. The following tables summarize the\ncomponents of our deposits, short-term\nborrowings and long-term debt as of September\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

                      \nUse of Derivatives and Accounting for\nDerivatives\nWe regularly enter into derivative\ntransactions to support our overall risk\nmanagement activities. Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency derivatives to hedge, but we\nmay also use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We then enter\ninto derivative contracts with counterparties\nto economically hedge substantially all of our\nsubsequent exposures.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of AOCI. Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the forecasted transactions\nimpact earnings and presented in the same line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income\nas the earnings effect of the hedged items.\nOur cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps\nand floors that are intended to hedge the\nvariability in interest receipts or interest\npayments on some of our variable-rate\nfinancial assets or liabilities. We also enter\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  112    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that arises from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d) and\nthe LCH Group (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs in our\ncentrally cleared contracts. In our uncleared\nbilateral contracts, we enter into agreements\ndirectly with our derivative counterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements, where possible, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. The amount of collateral\nexchanged is dependent upon the fair value of\nthe derivative instruments as well as the fair\nvalue of the pledged collateral and will vary\nover time as market variables change. When\nvaluing collateral, an estimate of the\nvariation in price and liquidity over time is\nsubtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d to\ndiscount the value of the collateral pledged.\nOur exposure to derivative counterparty credit\nrisk, at any point in time, is equal to the\namount reported as a derivative asset on our\nbalance sheet. The fair value of our\nderivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis\nto take into consideration the effects of\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand any associated cash collateral received or\npledged. See Table 8.3 for our net exposure\nassociated with derivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. Futures commission merchants\n(\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the intermediary between\nCCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial\nand variation margin through our FCMs to\nmitigate the risk of non-payment or default.\nInitial margin is required upfront by CCPs as\ncollateral against potential losses on our\ncleared derivative contracts and variation\nmargin is exchanged on a daily basis to\naccount for mark-to-market changes in those\nderivative contracts. For CME and LCH-cleared\nOTC derivatives, we characterize variation\nmargin cash payments as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nand collateral agreements, where possible,\nwith bilateral derivative counterparties to\nmitigate the risk of default. We review our\ncollateral positions on a daily basis and\nexchange collateral with our counterparties in\naccordance with these agreements. These\nbilateral agreements typically provide the\nright to offset exposure with the same\ncounterparty and require the party in a net\nliability position to post collateral.\nAgreements with certain bilateral\ncounterparties require both parties to\nmaintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of derivative instruments exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty. We also\nrecord debit valuation adjustments (\u201cDVAs\u201d) to\nadjust the fair values of our derivative\nliabilities to reflect the impact of our own\ncredit quality.\n                                              \n  113    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nBalance Sheet Presentation\nThe following table summarizes the notional\namounts and fair values of our derivative\ninstruments as of September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019, which are segregated by\nderivatives that are designated as accounting\nhedges and those that are not, and are further\nsegregated by type of contract within those\ntwo categories.

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity\nand credit spreads, in isolation, would result\nin a decrease in the fair value measurement.\nIn addition, an increase in default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by a decrease\nin recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and\nan increase in liquidity spreads.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements\n\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess provides a funds credit for sources of\nfunds, such as deposits generated by our\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a funds charge for the use of\nfunds by each segment. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate third-party rates. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d in\nour 2019 Form 10-K.\nSegment Results and Reconciliation\nWe may periodically change our business\nsegments or reclassify business segment\nresults based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies or changes\nin organizational alignment.

The contractual amount of these\ncommitments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to us should the counterparty draw\nupon the commitment. We generally manage the\npotential risk of unfunded lending commitments\nby limiting the total amount of arrangements,\nmonitoring the size and maturity structure of\nthese portfolios, and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of September 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019.

We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of the loans.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair\nvalue option on new loss sharing agreements.\nUnrealized gains and losses are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income. For those loss sharing\nagreements entered into as of December 31,\n2019, we amortize the liability recorded at\ninception into non-interest income as we are\nreleased from risk of payment under the loss\nsharing agreement and record our estimate of\nexpected credit losses each period in\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The\nliability recognized on our consolidated\nbalance sheets for these loss sharing\nagreements was $ 99million and $ 75million as\nof September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019,\nrespectively.\n                                              \n  138    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nSee \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and\nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for\nmore information related to our credit card\npartnership loss sharing arrangements.\n\nU.K. Payment Protection Insurance\n\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). In response to\nan elevated level of customer complaints\nacross the industry, heightened media coverage\nand pressure from consumer advocacy groups,\nthe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d),\nformerly the Financial Services Authority,\ninvestigated and raised concerns about the way\nthe industry has handled complaints related to\nthe sale of these insurance policies. For the\npast several years, the U.K.\u2019s Financial\nOmbudsman Service (\u201cFOS\u201d) has been\nadjudicating customer complaints relating to\nPPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree\nwith the rejection of their complaint by\nfirms, leading to customer remediation\npayments by us and others within the industry.\nIn August 2017, the FCA issued final rules and\nguidance on the PPI complaints. This set the\ndeadline for complaints as August 29, 2019. It\nalso provided clarity on how to handle PPI\ncomplaints under s.140A of the Consumer Credit\nAct, including guidance on how redress for\nsuch complaints should be calculated.\n\nCOEP has now materially completed the handling\nof PPI complaints that were received prior to\nthe deadline set by the FCA. Escalations to\nthe FOS (by customers or their\nrepresentatives) may still take place until\nthe first quarter of 2021. Throughout this\ntime, the FCA will continue to supervise firms\nthat handle PPI complaints and the supporting\nprocesses, people and systems.\n\nOur U.K. PPI reserve declined to a de minimis\namount at September 30, 2020 from $ 188million\nas of December 31, 2019. We do not believe\nthere are significant reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserve as of\nSeptember 30, 2020.\n\nIn determining our best estimate of incurred\nlosses for future remediation payments,\nmanagement considers numerous factors,\nincluding (i) the number of customer\ncomplaints or information requests still to be\nprocessed; (ii) our expectation of upholding\nthose complaints; (iii) the expected number of\ncomplaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv)\nour expectation of the FOS upholding such\nescalated complaints; (v) the number of\ncomplaints that fall under s.140A of the\nConsumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated\nremediation payout to customers. We monitor\nthese factors each quarter and adjust our\nreserves to reflect the latest data.\nLitigation\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for litigation-related matters that\narise from the ordinary course of our business\nactivities when it is probable that a loss\nassociated with a claim or proceeding has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of\nSeptember 30, 2020 are approximately $\n1.0billion. Our reserve and reasonably\npossible loss estimates involve considerable\njudgment and reflect that there is still\nsignificant uncertainty regarding numerous\nfactors that may impact the ultimate loss\nlevels. Notwithstanding our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlitigation matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and the range of reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed here. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in these matters,\nespecially those involving governmental\nagencies, and the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these matters, there\nis significant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these litigation\nmatters and an adverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be material to our\nresults of operations or cash flows for any\nparticular reporting period.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did\n                                              \n  139    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nnot name any issuing banks, Visa, MasterCard\nand issuers, including Capital One, have\nentered settlement and judgment sharing\nagreements allocating the liabilities of any\njudgment or settlement arising from all\ninterchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds settlements for its member\nbanks, and any settlements related to\nMasterCard-allocated losses have either\nalready been paid or are reflected in our\nreserves.\nMortgage Representation and Warranty\nWe face residual exposure related to\nsubsidiaries that originated residential\nmortgage loans and sold these loans to various\npurchasers, including purchasers who created\nsecuritization trusts. In connection with\ntheir sales of mortgage loans, these\nsubsidiaries entered into agreements\ncontaining varying representations and\nwarranties about, among other things, the\nownership of the loan, the validity of the\nlien securing the loan, the loan\u2019s compliance\nwith any applicable criteria established by\nthe purchaser, including underwriting\nguidelines and the existence of mortgage\ninsurance, and the loan\u2019s compliance with\napplicable federal, state and local laws. Each\nof these subsidiaries may be required to\nrepurchase mortgage loans or indemnify certain\npurchasers and others against losses they\nincur in the event of certain breaches of\nthese representations and warranties.\n\nThe substantial majority of our representation\nand warranty exposure has been resolved\nthrough litigation, and our remaining\nrepresentation and warranty exposure is almost\nentirely litigation-related. Accordingly, we\nestablish litigation reserves for\nrepresentation and warranty losses that we\nconsider to be both probable and reasonably\nestimable. The reserve process relies heavily\non estimates, which are inherently uncertain,\nand requires the application of judgment. Our\nreserves and estimates of reasonably possible\nlosses could be impacted by claims which may\nbe brought by securitization trustees and\nsponsors, bond-insurers, investors, and GSEs,\nas well as claims brought by governmental\nagencies.\nAnti-Money Laundering\nIn October 2018, we paid a civil monetary\npenalty of $ 100million to resolve the\nmonetary component of a July 2015 Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d)\nconsent order relating to our anti-money\nlaundering (\u201cAML\u201d) program. The OCC lifted the\nAML consent order in November 2019.\n\nThe Department of Justice and the New York\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office have closed their\ninvestigations into certain former check\ncasher clients of the Commercial Banking\nbusiness and our AML program. We are in\ndiscussions with the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury to explore a potential\nregulatory resolution of its investigation\ninto our AML program, which could include a\nmonetary penalty.\nCybersecurity Incident\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident\nannounced on July 29, 2019, we are subject to\nnumerous legal proceedings and other inquiries\nand could be the subject of additional\nproceedings and inquiries in the future.\n\nConsumer class actions . To date, we have been\nnamed as a defendant in approximately\n73putative consumer class action cases ( 61in\nU.S. federal courts and 12in Canadian courts)\nalleging harm from the Cybersecurity Incident\nand seeking various remedies, including\nmonetary and injunctive relief. The lawsuits\nallege breach of contract, negligence,\nviolations of various privacy laws and a\nvariety of other legal causes of action. The\nU.S. consumer class actions have been\nconsolidated for pretrial proceedings before a\nmulti-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District\nof Virginia, Alexandria Division. In the third\nquarter of 2020, the MDL panel denied in part\nand granted in part Capital One\u2019s motion to\ndismiss and permitted pretrial discovery to\ncontinue.\n                                              \n  140    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nSecurities class action . The Company and\ncertain officers have also been named as\ndefendants in a putative class action pending\nin the MDL alleging violations of certain\nfederal securities laws in connection with\nstatements and alleged omissions in securities\nfilings relating to our information security\nstandards and practices. The complaint seeks\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief.\n\nGovernmental inquiries . We have received\ninquiries and requests for information\nrelating to the Cybersecurity Incident from\nCongress, federal banking regulators, relevant\nCanadian regulators, the Department of\nJustice, and the offices of approximately\nfourteen state Attorneys General. We are\ncooperating with these offices and responding\nto their inquiries.\n\nIn August 2020, we entered into consent orders\nwith the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\nand the OCC resulting from regulatory reviews\nof the Cybersecurity Incident and relating to\nongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and\noperational risk management processes. We paid\nan $ 80million penalty to the U.S. Treasury as\npart of the OCC agreement. The Federal Reserve\nBoard agreement did not contain a monetary\npenalty.\nTaxi Medallion Finance Investigations\nBeginning in 2019, we have received subpoenas\nfrom the New York Attorney General\u2019s office\nand from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nSouthern District of New York, Civil and\nCriminal Divisions, relating to investigations\nof the taxi medallion finance industry we\nexited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek,\namong other things, information regarding our\nlending counterparties and practices. We are\ncooperating with these investigations.\nU.K. PPI Litigation\nSome of the claimants in the U.K. PPI\nregulatory claims process described above have\ninitiated legal proceedings. The significant\nincrease in PPI regulatory claim volumes\nshortly before the August 29, 2019 claims\nsubmission deadline increases the potential\nexposure for PPI-related litigation, which is\nnot subject to the August 29, 2019 deadline.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions, is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  141    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.
