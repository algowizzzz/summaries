           \n  Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure.  \n                                        \nOn April 6, 2023, Capital One, National\nAssociation, a subsidiary of\nCapital One Financial Corporation (\u201cCapital\nOne\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), received from Walmart\na notice of termination\nof the credit card partnership agreement (the\n\u201cCCPA\u201d) under which Capital One is the\nexclusive issuer of Walmart\u2019s private\nlabel and co-branded credit card program in\nthe U.S. (the \u201cCard Program\u201d). On April 7,\n2023, Walmart filed a lawsuit in the\nSouthern District of New York seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment that it has the\ncontractual right to terminate the Card\nProgram early. Capital\nOne disputes that Walmart has any right to\nterminate the Card Program mid-stream and will\nvigorously defend our contractual rights in\ncourt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Card Program\nconsisted of approximately\n$8.3 billion in ending outstanding loan\nbalances and the allowance for credit losses\nrelated to the Card Program portfolio was\napproximately\n$314 million. The allowance for credit losses\nas well as the capital we hold against the\nCard Program portfolio are lower than they\nwould\nbe otherwise due to the loss sharing\narrangement agreed to as part of the Card\nProgram. For the year ended December 31, 2022,\nthe Card\nProgram produced approximately $214 million in\nnet income after taxes. Any future financial\nimpacts will depend on the timing and final\nresolution of this matter, including the\nrelated litigation, and future management\nactions.\n\nIf a court finds that Walmart is permitted to\nterminate the Card Program\nearly, we would expect the resulting transfer\nof the card portfolio to a new issuer to occur\nno earlier than January 2025. The CCPA also\nrequires that Walmart or one or more new\nissuers pay to Capital One a purchase price\nthat is equal to par for the private label\naccounts,\nand equal to fair market value for the co-\nbranded accounts, in each case, that are part\nof the Card Program. Capital One is entitled\nunder\nthe CCPA to retain any premium above 1.5% of\nthe par value of the co-branded accounts upon\nsale.\n\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements.\n\nThe information provided in this Form 8-K\ncontains forward-looking\nstatements, which involve a number of risks\nand uncertainties. The Company cautions\nreaders that any forward-looking information\nis not\na guarantee of future performance and that\nactual results could differ materially from\nthose contained in the forward-looking\ninformation\ndue to a number of factors, including those\nlisted from time to time in reports that the\nCompany files with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, including, but not limited to, the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.
