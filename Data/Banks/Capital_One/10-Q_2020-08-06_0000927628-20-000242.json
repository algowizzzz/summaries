As of June 30, 2020 ,\nour principal subsidiaries included:\n                                              \n     Capital One Bank (USA), National         \n     Association (\u201cCOBNA\u201d), which offers      \n  \u2022  credit and debit card products, other    \n     lending products and deposit products;   \n     and                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n     Capital One, National Association        \n     (\u201cCONA\u201d), which offers a broad spectrum  \n  \u2022  of banking products and financial        \n     services to consumers, small businesses  \n     and commercial clients.                  \n                                              \nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d COBNA and CONA are\ncollectively referred to as the \u201cBanks.\u201d\nCertain business terms used in this document\nare defined in the \u201cMD&A\u2014Glossary and\nAcronyms\u201d and should be read in conjunction\nwith the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Report. Our consolidated\ntotal net revenues are derived primarily from\nlending to consumer, small business and\ncommercial customers net of funding costs\nassociated with interest on deposits, short-\nterm borrowings and long-term debt. We also\nearn non-interest income which primarily\nconsists of interchange income net of reward\nexpenses, and service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees. Our expenses primarily\nconsist of the provision for credit losses,\noperating expenses, marketing expenses and\nincome taxes. Our principal operations are\norganized for management reporting purposes\ninto three major business segments, which are\ndefined primarily based on the products and\nservices provided or the types of customer\nserved: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking. The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at\nthe consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments,\nare included in the Other category.\n                                              \n     Credit Card:Consists of our domestic     \n     consumer and small business card         \n  \u2022  lending, and international card          \n     businesses in Canada and the United      \n     Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d).                        \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n     Consumer Banking:Consists of our         \n  \u2022  deposit gathering and lending            \n     activities for consumers and small       \n     businesses, and national auto lending.   \n                                              \n                                              \n     Commercial Banking:Consists of our       \n     lending, deposit gathering, capital      \n     markets and treasury management          \n     services to commercial real estate and   \n  \u2022  commercial and industrial customers.     \n     Our commercial and industrial customers  \n     typically include companies with annual  \n     revenues between $20 million and $2      \n     billion.                                 \n                                              \nBusiness Developments We regularly explore and\nevaluate opportunities to acquire financial\nservices and products as well as financial\nassets, including credit card and other loan\nportfolios, and enter into strategic\npartnerships as part of our growth strategy.\nWe also explore opportunities to acquire\ntechnology companies and related assets to\nimprove our information technology\ninfrastructure and to deliver on our digital\nstrategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund\nour acquisitions. In addition, we regularly\nconsider the potential disposition of certain\nof our assets, branches, partnership\nagreements or lines of business. On September\n24, 2019, we launched a new credit card\nissuance program with Walmart Inc. (\u201cWalmart\u201d)\nand are now the exclusive issuer of Walmart\u2019s\ncobrand and private label credit card program\nin the U.S. On October 11, 2019, we completed\nthe acquisition of the existing portfolio of\nWalmart\u2019s cobrand and private label credit\ncard receivables, which added approximately\n$8.1 billion to our domestic credit card loans\nheld for investment portfolio as of the\nacquisition date. In the second quarter of\n2019, we made the decision to exit several\nsmall partnership portfolios in our Credit\nCard business. We sold approximately $900\nmillion of receivables and transferred\napproximately $100 million to loans held for\nsale as of June 30, 2019, which resulted in a\ngain on sale of $49 million recognized in\nother non-interest income and an allowance\nrelease of $68 million. Coronavirus Disease\n2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic\nhas resulted in a global public-health crisis,\ndisrupting economies and introducing\nsignificant volatility into financial markets\nand uncertainty as to when economic and\noperating conditions will return to normalcy.\nThis crisis continues to impact individuals,\nhouseholds and businesses in a multitude of\nways. Companies in the U.S. and abroad have\nexperienced unprecedented disruptions to\nnormal business operations, including\ncustomer-facing interactions, supply chains,\noffice closures, changes in demand for\nproducts and services, and others. Financial\ninstitutions, including us, have been deemed\nan essential service and exempted from the\nmyriad of shutdowns across the country. We\nhave transformed how we work in order to\nprotect the well-being of our associates and\nour customers, serve our customers, support\nour communities, and position ourselves to\nnavigate the challenges ahead. Since the start\nof the pandemic, a significant majority of our\nassociates across our workforce have\ntransitioned to working remotely, relying on\nour technology infrastructure and systems that\nwe have designed for resilience and security.\nThe majority of our associates will continue\nto work remotely throughout 2020, as we\ncontinue to prioritize the safety of our\nassociates while planning our return to the\noffice. We have been able to continue serving\ncustomers, successfully managing critical\nfunctions and keeping our lines of business\noperating. During the second quarter of 2020,\nwe maintained the additional paid benefits and\nflexible attendance policies that are intended\nto enable our associates to care for their\nfamilies and loved ones. This included the\nincreased pay implemented in the first quarter\nof 2020 for branch associates working in open\nlocations and associates that perform\nessential and time-sensitive banking\nactivities that cannot be performed remotely,\nas well as a pay increase for other U.S.-based\nassociates in roles instrumental to\nmaintaining essential customer support, such\nas our call center agents and branch\nassociates. We continue to monitor and revise\nour safety precautions and policies at banking\nlocations as government authorities continue\nto implement and modify measures to contain\nthe further spread of COVID-19. In our Retail\nBanking business, over 90% of our branches\nwere open at the end of the second quarter\nwith increased safety precautions as we\ncontinue to provide critical banking services.\nWe will continue to monitor local conditions\nand may open the remaining branches and Caf\u00e9s\nwhere conditions warrant. We continue to offer\na range of policies and programs to\naccommodate customer hardship across our lines\nof business. In our Credit Card and Auto\nFinance businesses, our customers can seek\nforbearance primarily in the form of short-\nterm payment deferrals or extensions and fee\nwaivers. In our Domestic Card business,\nexcluding certain retail partnership\nportfolios, enrollments were approximately\n50,000 accounts per week at the end of the\nsecond quarter, down from around 150,000\naccounts per week at the end of first quarter,\nand approximately two-thirds of the recent\nweekly enrollments were renewals. Through June\n30, 2020, we have enrolled a total of 2% of\nactive accounts representing 3% of loans\noutstanding, and approximately 92% of these\ncustomers\n                                              \n  5  Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)  \n                                              \nTable of Contents were current at the time of\ntheir first enrollment. In our Auto business,\nenrollments were approximately 30,000 accounts\nper week at the end of second quarter, down\nfrom around 100,000 accounts per week at end\nof the first quarter, and approximately 60% of\nthe recent weekly enrollments were renewals.\nThrough June 30, 2020, we have enrolled a\ntotal of 14% of accounts representing 16% of\nloans outstanding, and approximately 75% of\nthese customers were current at the time of\ntheir first enrollment. In our Retail Banking\nbusiness, we are waiving select fees for\nimpacted customers and offering short-term\npayment deferrals for our small business\nbanking customers. We are also working with\nour Commercial Banking customers on a more\ncustomized basis. In addition, we have also\nparticipated in the Paycheck Protection\nProgram (\u201cPPP\u201d), established by the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security\nAct (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) enacted in March 2020\nand implemented by the Small Business\nAdministration. As of June 30, 2020, we funded\n$1.2 billion of PPP loans. See \u201cMD&A\u2014 Credit\nRisk Profile \u201d for more information about our\ncustomer assistance programs. Our results for\nthe second quarter and the first six months of\n2020 were a net loss of $918 million, or $2.21\nper share, and a net loss of $2.2 billion, or\n$5.31 per share, respectively, primarily\ndriven by allowance builds due to the\nexpectations of economic worsening and\nuncertainty as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic . In addition, the combination of\nthese allowance builds and the adoption impact\nof the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nstandard more than doubled our allowance\ncoverage ratio to 6.7% as of June 30, 2020\nfrom 2.7% as of December 31, 2019.

In the\nsecond quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic\ncontinued to impact the demand for our\nproducts and services. In our Domestic Card\nbusiness, purchase volumes and loan balances\ndeclined from consumers reducing spending and\npaying down their balances. In our Auto\nbusiness, we saw an increase in origination\nvolumes and loan growth from the sharp decline\nat the end of the first quarter, with the\nrebound stronger in the market segments where\nwe are focused. Our loan growth was largely\ndriven by increased originations from our\ndealer business as a result of our\nrelationship strategy and digital capabilities\nas well as our direct-to-consumer business\nenabled by our digital products and services.\nIn our Retail Banking business, we saw strong\ndeposit growth from increased consumer savings\nincluding the impact of the government\nstimulus. There is still great uncertainty\nsurrounding the course of this pandemic and\nthe magnitude and duration of the disruption\nto economic activity and how this disruption\nwill continue to impact demand for our\nproducts and services across all of our\nofferings. We are actively monitoring and\nresponding to developments across the myriad\nof landscapes affected by the COVID-19\npandemic, including social, financial, legal,\nregulatory and governmental. We continue to\nevaluate the impacts of the CARES Act on us\nand our customers. As other guidance is issued\nby our regulators, we continue to assess the\nimpacts to us. As government authorities\ncontinue to implement and modify social\ndistancing and reopening plans and other\nmeasures to contain the further spread of\nCOVID-19, we will continue to adjust our\nbusiness operations, policies and practices,\nkeeping the best interests of our associates,\ncustomers and business partners at the\nforefront. See \u201c Part II \u2014 Item 1A. Risk\nFactors \u201d in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the period ended March 31, 2020 for\nadditional information regarding risks and the\nsignificant uncertainties relating to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Cybersecurity Incident On\nJuly 29, 2019, we announced that on March 22\nand 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nWe retained a leading independent\ncybersecurity firm that confirmed we correctly\nidentified and fixed the specific\nconfiguration vulnerability exploited in the\nCybersecurity Incident. We continue to invest\nsignificantly in cybersecurity and related\nrisk management activities and expect to make\nadditional investments as we continue to\nassess our cybersecurity program. During the\nsecond quarter of 2020, we incurred $27\nmillion of incremental expenses related to the\nremediation of and response to the\nCybersecurity Incident, offset by $16 million\nof insurance recoveries. To date, we have\nincurred $113 million of incremental expenses,\noffset by $60 million of insurance recoveries\npursuant to the cyber risk insurance coverage\nwe carry. These expenses mainly consist of\ncustomer notifications, credit monitoring,\ntechnology costs, and professional support. We\nexpect total incremental costs through the end\nof 2020 will be at the high end of the $100\nmillion to $150 million range previously\ndisclosed. As the timing\n                                              \n  6  Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)  \n                                              \nTable of Contents of recognizing insurance\nreimbursements may differ from the timing of\nrecognizing the associated expenses, any such\nreimbursements are not considered in this\nrange, though we continue to expect that a\nsignificant portion of these expenses will be\ncovered by insurance. We carry insurance to\ncover certain costs associated with a cyber\nrisk event. This insurance has a total\ncoverage limit of $400 million and is subject\nto a $10 million deductible, which was met in\nthe third quarter of 2019, as well as standard\nexclusions. We continue to treat these\nexpenses and insurance reimbursements as\nadjusting items as they relate to our\nfinancial results (\u201cCyber Adjusting Items\u201d).\nOur reported results excluding adjusting\nitems, including the Cyber Adjusting Items,\nrepresent non-GAAP measures which we believe\nhelp users of our financial information\nunderstand the impact of these adjusting items\non our reported results as well as provide an\nalternate measurement of our operating\nperformance. Although the ultimate magnitude\nand timing of expenses or other impacts to our\nbusiness or reputation related to the\nCybersecurity Incident are uncertain, they may\nbe significant, and some of the costs may not\nbe covered by insurance. However, we do not\nbelieve that this incident will materially\nimpact our strategy or our long-term financial\nhealth.

Net Interest Income Net interest\nincome represents the difference between the\ninterest income, including certain fees,\nearned on our interest-earning assets and the\ninterest expense incurred on our interest-\nbearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets\ninclude loans, investment securities and other\ninterest-earning assets, while our interest-\nbearing liabilities include interest-bearing\ndeposits, securitized debt obligations, senior\nand subordinated notes, other borrowings and\nother interest-bearing liabilities. Generally,\nwe include in interest income any past due\nfees on loans that we deem collectible.

Income Taxes We recorded an\nincome tax benefit of $543 million ( 37.2%\neffective income tax rate) and $1.1 billion (\n32.9% effective income tax rate) in the second\nquarter and first six months of 2020 ,\nrespectively, compared to an income tax\nexpense of $387 million (19.3% effective\nincome tax rate) and $696 million (18.7%\neffective income tax rate) in the second\nquarter and first six months of 2019 ,\nrespectively. Our effective income tax rate\nincreased in 2020 as compared to 2019\nprimarily driven by the relationship of our\ntax credits in proportion to our pre-tax\nearnings.

Total liabilities increased by $32.9\nbillion to $365.3 billion as of June 30, 2020\nfrom December 31, 2019 primarily driven by\ndeposit growth from increased consumer savings\nincluding the impact of government stimulus.\nStockholders\u2019 equity decreased by $2.0 billion\nto $56.0 billion as of June 30, 2020 from\nDecember 31, 2019 primarily driven by the $2.2\nbillion of retained earnings impact of the\nCECL standard adoption in the first quarter\nand our net loss for the first six months of\n2020, partially offset by an increase in\naccumulated other comprehensive income from an\nincrease in the fair value of our investment\nsecurities and derivatives driven by the\ndecline in interest rates. The following is a\ndiscussion of material changes in the major\ncomponents of our assets and liabilities\nduring the first six months of 2020 . Period-\nend balance sheet amounts may vary from\naverage balance sheet amounts due to liquidity\nand balance sheet management activities that\nare intended to support the adequacy of\ncapital while managing our liquidity\nrequirements, our customers and our market\nrisk exposure in accordance with our risk\nappetite. Investment Securities Our investment\nsecurities portfolio consists primarily of the\nfollowing: U.S. Treasury securities, U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored enterprise or agency\n(\u201cAgency\u201d) and non-agency residential\nmortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d), Agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities\n(\u201cCMBS\u201d), and other securities. Agency\nsecurities include Government National\nMortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d) guaranteed\nsecurities, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d)\nissued securities. The U.S. Treasury and\nAgency securities generally have high credit\nratings and low credit risks, and our\ninvestments in U.S. Treasury and Agency\nsecurities represented 97% and 96% of our\ntotal investment securities portfolio, as of\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively. The fair value of our available\nfor sale securities portfolio increased by\n$8.6 billion to $87.9 billion as of June 30,\n2020 from December 31, 2019 , primarily driven\nby net purchases and fair value gains from the\ndecline in interest rates.

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a segment, such as management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio and\nasset/liability management by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and residual tax\nexpense or benefit to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate that is not\nassessed to our primary business segments, are\nincluded in the Other category. The results of\nour individual businesses, which we report on\na continuing operations basis, reflect the\nmanner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources. We\nmay periodically change our business segments\nor reclassify business segment results based\non modifications to our management reporting\nmethodologies and changes in organizational\nalignment. Our business segment results are\nintended to reflect each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. We use an internal\nmanagement and reporting process to derive our\nbusiness segment results. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process employs\nvarious allocation methodologies, including\nfunds transfer pricing, to assign certain\nbalance sheet assets, deposits and other\nliabilities and their related revenue and\nexpenses directly or indirectly attributable\nto each business segment. Total interest\nincome and non-interest income are directly\nattributable to the segment in which they are\nreported. The net interest income of each\nsegment reflects the results of our funds\ntransfer pricing process, which is primarily\nbased on a matched funding concept that takes\ninto consideration market interest rates. Our\nfunds transfer pricing process provides a\nfunds credit for sources of funds, such as\ndeposits generated by our Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking businesses, and a charge\nfor the use of funds by each segment. The\nallocation process is unique to each business\nsegment and acquired businesses. We regularly\nassess the assumptions, methodologies and\nreporting classifications used for segment\nreporting, which may result in the\nimplementation of refinements or changes in\nfuture periods. We provide additional\ninformation on the allocation methodologies\nused to derive our business segment results in\n\u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments and Revenue from\nContracts with Customers\u201d in our 2019 Form\n10-K. We refer to the business segment results\nderived from our internal management\naccounting and reporting process as our\n\u201cmanaged\u201d presentation, which differs in some\ncases from our reported results prepared based\non U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore,\nthe managed presentation of our business\nsegment results may not be comparable to\nsimilar information provided by other\nfinancial services companies.

We provide a summary of our\nsignificant accounting policies under \u201c Note\n1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \u201d\nin this Report and in our 2019 Form 10-K. We\nhave identified the following accounting\nestimates as critical because they require\nsignificant judgments and assumptions about\nhighly complex and inherently uncertain\nmatters and the use of reasonably different\nestimates and assumptions could have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations\nor financial condition. Our critical\naccounting policies and estimates are as\nfollows:\n                         \n  \u2022  Loan loss reserves  \n                         \n                       \n  \u2022  Asset impairment  \n                       \n                                          \n  \u2022  Fair value of financial instruments  \n                                          \n                               \n  \u2022  Customer rewards reserve  \n                               \nWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates\nand judgments on an ongoing basis and update\nthem as necessary, based on changing\nconditions.\n                                              \n  31  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents Loan Loss Reserves In the\nfirst quarter of 2020, we adopted Accounting\nStandards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments (\u201cCECL\u201d) and updated our\ncritical accounting policy and estimate for\nloan loss reserves. We maintain an allowance\nfor credit losses that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\ninherent in our credit card, consumer banking\nand commercial banking loans held for\ninvestment as of each balance sheet date. We\nalso separately reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments that are not unconditionally\ncancellable. For all such loans and unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimate of expected\ncredit losses includes a reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period of one year and\nthen reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses. We build our allowance for\ncredit losses and reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments through the provision for credit\nlosses, which is driven by charge-offs,\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses and\nchanges in the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The allowance for credit losses\nwas $16.8 billion as of June 30, 2020 and $7.2\nbillion as of December 31, 2019 . We have an\nestablished process, using analytical tools\nand management judgment, to determine our\nallowance for credit losses. Establishing the\nallowance each quarter involves evaluating\nmany factors including, but not limited to,\nhistorical loss and recovery experience,\nrecent trends in delinquencies and charge-\noffs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy\nfilings, the value of collateral underlying\nsecured loans, account seasoning, changes in\nour credit evaluation, underwriting and\ncollection management policies, seasonality,\ncredit bureau scores, current general economic\nconditions, our reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions,\nchanges in the legal and regulatory\nenvironment and uncertainties in forecasting\nand modeling techniques used in estimating our\nallowance for credit losses. Key factors that\nhave a significant impact on our allowance for\ncredit losses include assumptions about\nemployment levels, home prices and the\nvaluation of commercial properties,\nautomobiles and other collateral. We have a\ngovernance framework intended to ensure that\nour estimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses is appropriate. Our governance\nframework provides for oversight of methods,\nmodels, qualitative adjustments, process\ncontrols and results. At least quarterly,\nrepresentatives from the Finance and Risk\nManagement organizations review and assess our\nallowance methodologies, key assumptions and\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for\ncredit losses. Groups independent of our\nestimation functions participate in the review\nand validation process. Tasks performed by\nthese groups include periodic review of the\nrationale for and quantification of inputs\nrequiring judgment as well as adjustments to\nresults. We have a model policy, established\nby an independent Model Risk Office, which\ngoverns the validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for estimating\ncredit losses. The Model Risk Office validates\nall models and requires ongoing monitoring of\ntheir performance. In addition to the\nallowance for credit losses, on a quarterly\nbasis, we review and assess our estimate of\nexpected losses related to unfunded lending\ncommitments that are not unconditionally\ncancellable. The factors impacting our\nassessment generally align with those\nconsidered in our evaluation of the allowance\nfor credit losses for the Commercial Banking\nbusiness. Changes to the reserve for losses on\nunfunded lending commitments are recorded\nthrough the provision for credit losses in the\nconsolidated statements of income and to other\nliabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets. Although we examine a variety of\nexternally available data, as well as our\ninternal loan performance data, to determine\nour allowance for credit losses and reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments, our\nestimation process is subject to risks and\nuncertainties, including a reliance on\nhistorical loss and trend information that may\nnot be representative of current conditions\nand indicative of future performance as well\nas economic forecasts that may not align with\nactual future economic conditions.\nAccordingly, our actual credit loss experience\nmay not be in line with our expectations. We\nprovide additional information on the\nmethodologies and key assumptions used in\ndetermining our allowance for credit losses\nfor each of our loan portfolio segments in \u201c\nNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies \u201d and changes in our allowance in \u201c\nNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve\nfor Unfunded Lending Commitments .\u201d Finance\nCharge and Fee Reserve Finance charges and\nfees on credit card loans are recorded in\nrevenue when earned. Billed finance charges\nand fees on credit card loans are included in\nloans held for investment while unbilled\nfinance charges and fees are included in\ninterest receivable. We continue to accrue\nfinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nuntil the account is charged off. Billed\nfinance charges and fees that are charged-off\nare reflected as a reduction to revenue.\nConcurrent with our adoption of the CECL\nstandard in the first quarter of 2020, we\nreclassified our finance charge and fee\nreserve of $462 million to our allowance for\ncredit losses, with a corresponding increase\nto credit card loans held for investment. We\n                                              \n  32  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents review and assess the\nappropriateness of our finance charge and fee\nreserve on a quarterly basis. Our methodology\nfor estimating the uncollectible portion of\nfinance charges and fees is consistent with\nthe methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on the principal\nportion of our credit card loan receivables.\nAsset Impairment In addition to our loan\nportfolio, we review other assets for\nimpairment on a regular basis in accordance\nwith applicable accounting guidance. This\nprocess requires significant management\njudgment and involves various estimates and\nassumptions. Goodwill We perform our goodwill\nimpairment test annually on October 1 at a\nreporting unit level. As of our last annual\ntest and as of June 30, 2020, we had four\nreporting units which included Credit Card,\nAuto Finance, Other Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking. We are also required to\ntest goodwill for impairment when a triggering\nevent occurs that indicates it is more likely\nthan not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is below its carrying amount. The\nmacroeconomic, industry and market factors\npreviously identified in the first quarter of\n2020 coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic\npersisted in the second quarter as there\ncontinued to be disruption in the economy and\ninterest rates remain low. We determined it\nwas more likely than not that the fair value\nof our reporting units remained substantially\nin excess of their carrying values as of June\n30, 2020. We will continue to monitor\ndevelopments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic\nand measures implemented in response to the\npandemic, our market capitalization, overall\neconomic conditions and any other triggering\nevents or circumstances that may cause an\nimpairment of goodwill in the future. In the\nfirst quarter of 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04,\nIntangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):\nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\nand updated our critical accounting policy for\ngoodwill impairment. Historical guidance for\ngoodwill impairment testing prescribed that\nthe company must compare each reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value to its fair value. If the\ncarrying value exceeds fair value, an entity\nperforms the second step, which assigns the\nreporting unit\u2019s fair value to its assets and\nliabilities, including unrecognized assets and\nliabilities, in the same manner as required in\npurchase accounting to determine the\nimpairment.

The level and composition of our\ncapital may also be influenced by rating\nagency guidelines, subsidiary capital\nrequirements, business environment, conditions\nin the financial markets and assessments of\npotential future losses due to adverse changes\nin our business and market environments.\nCapital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards\nadopted by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d),\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(\u201cOCC\u201d) and Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) (collectively, the\n\u201cFederal Banking Agencies\u201d), including the\ncapital rules that implemented the Basel III\ncapital framework (\u201cBasel III Capital Rule\u201d)\ndeveloped by the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d). Moreover, the\nBanks, as insured depository institutions, are\nsubject to Prompt Corrective Action (\u201cPCA\u201d)\ncapital regulations. The Basel III Capital\nRule includes the \u201cBasel III Standardized\nApproach\u201d and the \u201cBasel III Advanced\nApproaches.\u201d We entered parallel run under\nBasel III Advanced Approaches on January 1,\n2015, during which we were required to\ncalculate capital ratios under both the Basel\nIII Standardized Approach and the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches, though we used the\nStandardized Approach for purposes of meeting\nregulatory capital requirements. In October\n2019, the Federal Banking Agencies amended the\nBasel III Capital Rule to provide for tailored\napplication of certain capital requirements\nacross different categories of banking\ninstitutions (\u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). As a bank\nholding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nthat does not exceed any of the applicable\nrisk-based thresholds, we are a Category III\ninstitution under the Tailoring Rules. As\nsuch, we are no longer subject to the Basel\nIII Advanced Approaches and certain associated\ncapital requirements and have the option of\nexcluding certain elements of Accumulated\nother comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our\nregulatory capital. Effective in the first\nquarter of 2020, we excluded certain elements\nof AOCI from our regulatory capital as\npermitted by the Tailoring Rules. In July\n2019, the Federal Banking Agencies finalized\ncertain changes in the Basel III Capital Rule\nfor institutions not subject to the Basel III\nAdvanced Approaches, including Capital One\n(\u201cCapital Simplification Rule\u201d). These\nchanges, effective January 1, 2020, generally\nraise the threshold above which institutions\nsubject to the Capital Simplification Rule\nmust deduct certain assets from their common\nequity Tier 1 capital, including certain\ndeferred tax assets, mortgage servicing\nassets, and investments in unconsolidated\nfinancial institutions. While the higher\nthresholds will not impact our current capital\nlevels, in stress scenarios they may provide a\nbenefit by enabling us to include more\ndeferred tax assets in our common equity Tier\n1 capital. The Tailoring Rules and Capital\nSimplification Rule have, taken together,\ndecreased our capital requirements. The Basel\nIII Capital Rule requires banking institutions\nto maintain a capital conservation buffer,\ncomposed of common equity Tier 1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. In March\n2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule\nto implement the stress capital buffer\nrequirement (\u201cStress Capital Buffer Final\nRule\u201d). Pursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer\nFinal Rule, which became effective in May\n2020, the Federal Reserve will use the results\nof its supervisory stress test to determine\nthe size of a banking institution\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement. In particular, a\nbanking institution\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement will equal, subject to a floor of\n2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between\nthe banking institution\u2019s starting common\nequity Tier 1 capital ratio and its lowest\nprojected common equity Tier 1 capital ratio\nunder the severely adverse scenario of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test plus\n(ii) the ratio of the banking institution\u2019s\nprojected four quarters of common stock\ndividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters\nof the planning horizon) to the projected\nrisk-weighted assets for the quarter in which\nthe banking institution\u2019s projected common\nequity Tier 1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test. In\naddition, Category III institutions, including\nthe Company and the Banks, are subject to\ncertain capital requirements formerly\napplicable only to Basel III Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations. Category III\ninstitutions are subject to a supplementary\nleverage ratio of 3.0% and their capital\nconservation buffer may be supplemented by an\nincremental countercyclical capital buffer of\nup to 2.5% composed of common equity Tier 1\ncapital and set at the discretion of the\nFederal Banking Agencies. As of June 30, 2020,\nthe countercyclical capital buffer was zero\npercent in the United States. A determination\nto increase the countercyclical capital buffer\ngenerally would be effective twelve months\nafter the announcement of such an increase,\nunless the Federal Banking Agencies set an\nearlier effective date.\n                                              \n  34  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents The Market Risk Rule\nrequires institutions subject to the rule to\nadjust their risk-based capital ratios to\nreflect the market risk in their trading\nportfolios. As of June 30, 2020, the Company\nand CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule.\nSee \u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d below for\nadditional information. In March 2020, as part\nof the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nFederal Banking Agencies announced an interim\nfinal rule (\u201c2020 CECL IFR\u201d) that provides\nbanking organizations an optional five-year\ntransition period to phase in the impact of\nCECL on regulatory capital (the \u201c2020 CECL\nTransition Election\u201d). Pursuant to the 2020\nCECL IFR, banking organizations may elect to\ndelay for two years the estimated impact of\nCECL on regulatory capital and then phase in\nthe estimated cumulative impact of the initial\ntwo-year delay over the next three years. The\nestimated cumulative impact of CECL, which\nwill be phased in during the three-year\ntransition period, includes the after-tax\nimpact of adopting the CECL standard and the\nestimated impact of CECL in the initial two\nyears thereafter. The 2020 CECL IFR introduced\na uniform \u201cscaling factor\u201d of 25% for\nestimating the impact of CECL during the\ninitial two years. The 25% \u201cscaling factor\u201d is\nan approximation of the impact of differences\nin credit loss allowances reflected under the\nCECL standard versus the incurred loss\nmethodology. We reflected the 2020 CECL\nTransition Election in the applicable amounts\npresented in this Report and the corresponding\namounts as of March 31, 2020. As of June 30,\n2020, the minimum capital requirements plus\nthe capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer (currently\nset as 0%) for common equity Tier 1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios were\n7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively, for the\nCompany and the Banks. A common equity Tier 1\ncapital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, or total\ncapital ratio below the applicable regulatory\nminimum ratio plus the applicable capital\nconservation buffer and the applicable\ncountercyclical bu ffer (if set to an amount\ngreater than 0%) might restrict a banking\norganization\u2019s ability to distribute capital\nand make discretionary bonus payments.\nEffective October 1, 2020, our stress capital\nbuffer requirement will replace the existing\n2.5% capital conservation buffer.

The Federal Reserve has\nrequired all participating banks, including\nus, to update and resubmit their capital plans\nlater this year. Pursuant to the Federal\nReserve\u2019s capital plan rule, a participating\nbank, such as us, is prohibited from making\ncapital distributions without the prior\napproval of the Federal Reserve following an\nevent requiring the resubmission of its\ncapital plan. Specifically for the third\nquarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve has\nrequired all participating banks, including\nus, to preserve capital by suspending share\nrepurchases and capping common stock dividend\npayments to the lower of (i) the amount paid\nin the second quarter of 2020 and (ii) an\namount equal to the average net income across\nthe four preceding calendar quarters. Such\nrestrictions may be extended by the Federal\nReserve quarter-by-quarter as economic\nconditions continue to evolve. Scheduled\npayments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2\ncapital instruments, such as preferred stock\nand subordinated debt, are not similarly\nrestricted. As part of the 2020 CCAR process,\nthe Federal Reserve calculated our indicative\nstress capital buffer requirement as 5.6%. Our\nstress capital buffer requirement will be\nfinalized by August 31, 2020 and will become\neffective October 1, 2020. When combined with\nour minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio\nof 4.5%, our common equity Tier 1 capital\nratio requirement under the stress capital\nbuffer framework is expected to be 10.1%.

Equity Offerings and\nTransactions On January 31, 2020, we issued\n50,000,000 depositary shares, each\nrepresenting a 1/40th interest in a share of\nFixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred\nStock, Series J, $0.01 par value, with a\nliquidation preference of $25 per depositary\nshare (\u201cSeries J Preferred Stock\u201d). The net\nproceeds of the offering of Series J Preferred\nStock were approximately $1.2 billion, after\ndeducting underwriting commissions and\noffering expenses. Dividends on the Series J\nPreferred Stock are payable quarterly in\narrears at a rate of 4.80% per annum. On March\n2, 2020, we redeemed all outstanding shares of\nour Fixed Rate 6.00% Non-Cumulative Perpetual\nPreferred Stock Series B.

As\na BHC, our ability to pay dividends is largely\ndependent upon the receipt of dividends or\nother payments from our subsidiaries. The\nBanks are subject to regulatory restrictions\nthat limit their ability to transfer funds to\nour BHC. As of June 30, 2020 , there were $1.4\nbillion of funds available for dividend\npayments from COBNA and no funds available for\ndividend payments from CONA. There can be no\nassurance that we will declare and pay any\ndividends to stockholders. Consistent with our\n2019 Stock Repurchase Program which was\nannounced on June 27, 2019, our Board of\nDirectors authorized the repurchase of up to\n$2.2 billion of shares of common stock\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2019 through\nthe end of the second quarter of 2020.

The timing and exact amount of any\nfuture common stock repurchases will depend on\nvarious factors, including regulatory\napproval, market conditions, opportunities for\ngrowth, our capital position and the amount of\nretained earnings.

It also sets expectations for our\n\u201cThree Lines of Defense\u201d model, which defines\nthe roles, responsibilities and\naccountabilities for taking and managing risk\nacross the Company. Accountability for\noverseeing an effective Framework resides with\nour Board of Directors either directly or\nthrough its committees. The \u201cFirst Line of\nDefense\u201d consists of any line of business or\nfunction that is accountable for risk taking\nand is responsible for: (i) engaging in\nactivities designed to generate revenue or\nreduce expenses; (ii) providing operational\nsupport or servicing to any business function\nfor the delivery of products or services to\ncustomers; or (iii) providing technology\nservices in direct support of first line\nbusiness areas. Each line of business or first\nline function is responsible for managing the\nrisks associated with their activities,\nincluding identifying, assessing, measuring,\nmonitoring, controlling, and reporting the\nrisks within its business activities,\nconsistent with the risk framework. The\n\u201cSecond Line of Defense\u201d consists of two types\nof functions: Independent Risk Management\n(\u201cIRM\u201d) and Support Functions. IRM oversees\nrisk-taking activities and assesses risks and\nissues independent from the first line of\ndefense. Support Functions are centers of\nspecialized expertise (e.g., Human Resources,\nAccounting, Legal) that provide support\nservices to the Company. The \u201cThird Line of\nDefense\u201d is comprised of the Internal Audit\nand Credit Review functions. The third line\nprovides independent and objective assurance\nto senior management and to the Board of\nDirectors that the first and second lines of\ndefense have systems and governance processes\nwhich are well-designed and working as\nintended, and that the Framework is\nappropriate for our size, complexity and risk\nprofile.

The\nFramework was revised in July 2020 to remove\nLegal risk as a standalone risk category and\nthe risk methodology was refined to\nincorporate the assessment of legal impacts\nacross the remaining risk categories. These\nenhancements are aligned with regulatory\nguidance and industry practices. These changes\ncontinue to enable effective outcomes of our\nkey processes supporting the identification,\nassessment, measurement, monitoring, and\ncontrolling and reporting of risk, as well as\nthe Legal Department\u2019s role as a Second Line\nSupport Function as defined within the\nFramework.

Trends in delinquency rates are\nthe key credit quality indicator for our\ncredit card and retail banking loan portfolios\nas changes in delinquency rates can provide an\nearly warning of changes in potential future\ncredit losses. The key indicator we monitor\nwhen assessing the credit quality and risk of\nour auto loan portfolio is borrower credit\nscores as they provide insight into borrower\nrisk profiles, which give indications of\npotential future credit losses. The key credit\nquality indicator for our commercial loan\nportfolios is our internal risk ratings as we\ngenerally classify loans that have been\ndelinquent for an extended period of time and\nother loans with significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n                                              \n  43  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents Table 22 provides details on\nthe credit scores of our domestic credit card\nand auto loan portfolios as of June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 .\nTable 22 : Credit Score Distribution          \n                                              \n  (Perce\u2026         June\u00a0            December\u00a0  \n  of              30,2020          31,2019    \n  portfo\u2026                                     \n  Domest\u2026                                     \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014R\u2026                                     \n  FICO                                        \n  scores\u2026                                     \n  Greater                                     \n  than        67  %            67  %          \n  660                                         \n  660 or      33               33             \n  below                                       \n  Total      100  %           100  %          \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  origin\u2026                                     \n  FICO                                        \n  scores\u2026                                     \n  Greater                                     \n  than        46  %            48  %          \n  660                                         \n  621 -       20               20             \n  660                                         \n  620 or      34               32             \n  below                                       \n  Total      100  %           100  %          \n                                              \n__________                                    \n                                              \n       Percentages represent period-end       \n       loans held for investment in each      \n       credit score category.

Delinquency\nRates We consider the entire balance of an\naccount to be delinquent if the minimum\nrequired payment is not received by the\ncustomer\u2019s due date, measured at each balance\nsheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics\ninclude all loans held for investment that are\n30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day\nperforming delinquency metrics include loans\nthat are 30 or more days past due but are\ncurrently classified as performing and\naccruing interest.

Card loans enrolled in the\ndeferral program continue to accrue interest.\nTheir delinquency status is generally frozen\nat the time of enrollment and upon exiting the\nprogram, resumes to the status at the time of\nenrollment. Through June 30, 2020, excluding\ncertain retail partnership portfolios, we have\nenrolled 2% of active accounts representing\n$3.0 billion of loans outstanding, and\napproximately 92% of these customers were\ncurrent at the time of their first enrollment.\nAs of June 30, 2020, approximately 0.2% of\nthese customers, or $360 million of loans\noutstanding, have been approved to skip their\nupcoming payment and have not made that\npayment. For our international card customers,\nwe also offer short-term payment deferrals and\nfee waivers. Loans enrolled in the deferral\nprogram continue to accrue interest. As of\nJune 30, 2020, $307 million of loans were\nenrolled in this program.\n                       \n  \u2022  Consumer Banking  \n                       \nFor our auto customers, we are currently\noffering short-term payment extensions with an\noption to renew and fee waivers. Auto loans\nenrolled in short-term payment extensions\ncontinue to accrue interest. The contractual\nterm of the loan is extended by the length of\nthe short-term payment extension and the\ndelinquency status is updated to reflect the\nrevised terms of the loan. For customers that\nwere delinquent at the time of enrollment,\ntheir delinquency status is reduced\ncommensurate with the length of the short-term\npayment extension. Through June 30, 2020, we\nhave enrolled a total of 14.1% of accounts\nrepresenting $10.2 billion of loans\noutstanding, and approximately 75% of these\ncustomers were current at the time of their\nfirst enrollment. As of June 30, 2020,\napproximately 1.2% of these customers,\nrepresenting $893 million of loans\noutstanding, have been approved to skip their\nupcoming payment and have not made that\npayment. For our retail banking customers, we\nare currently offering fee waivers and short-\nterm payment deferrals. We also participated\nin the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) for\nour small business banking customers. As of\nJune 30, 2020, $272 million of loans were\nenrolled in the short-term payment deferral\nprogram and $931 million of loans were\nenrolled in the PPP.\n                         \n  \u2022  Commercial Banking  \n                         \nFor our commercial banking customers, our\nofferings are more customized, but generally\ninclude short-term payment deferrals.\nPerforming loans enrolled in short-term\npayment deferrals continue to accrue interest,\nand principal and interest are due at\nmaturity. Loans remain in their delinquency\nstatus as of their modification date through\nthe deferment period. Internal risk ratings\nare assigned based on relevant information\nabout the ability of the borrower to repay\ntheir debt. Similarly, we also participated in\nthe PPP for our commercial clients. As of June\n30, 2020, approximately $2.5 billion of loans\nwere enrolled in the short-term payment\ndeferral program and $231 million of loans\nwere enrolled in the PPP. Additional guidance\nissued by the Federal Banking Agencies and\ncontained in the CARES Act provides banking\norganizations with TDR relief for\nmodifications of current borrowers impacted by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed all loan\nmodifications introduced to current borrowers\nin response to COVID-19 as of June 30, 2020,\nand followed guidance that such eligible loan\nmodifications made on a temporary and good\nfaith basis are not considered TDRs.\n                                              \n  48  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents Troubled Debt Restructurings\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (three to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectability of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.

The effective\ninterest rate in effect immediately prior to\nthe loan modification is used as the effective\ninterest rate for purposes of measuring\nimpairment using the present value of expected\ncash flows. If the customer does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then the\ncredit card loan agreement may revert to its\noriginal payment terms, generally resulting in\nany loan outstanding reflected in the\nappropriate delinquency category and charged\noff in accordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy. In our Consumer Banking business, the\nmajority of our loans modified in TDRs receive\nan extension, an interest rate reduction or\nprincipal reduction, or a combination of these\nconcessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\nrecorded investment. In our Commercial Banking\nbusiness, the majority of loans modified in\nTDRs receive an extension, with a portion of\nthese loans receiving an interest rate\nreduction or a gross balance reduction. The\nimpairment on modified commercial loans is\ngenerally determined based on the underlying\ncollateral value.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance.

The\nprovision for losses on unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in the provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income and the related reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments is included in other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.

Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio We are subject to the Liquidity\nCoverage Ratio Rule (\u201cLCR Rule\u201d) as\nimplemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC.\nThe LCR Rule requires us to calculate our LCR\ndaily. It also requires the Company to\npublicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its\nLCR, certain related quantitative liquidity\nmetrics, and a qualitative discussion of its\nLCR. Our average LCR during the second quarter\nof 2020 was 146%, which exceeded the LCR Rule\nrequirement of 100%. The calculation and the\nunderlying components are based on our\ninterpretations, expectations and assumptions\nof relevant regulations, as well as\ninterpretations provided by our regulators,\nand are subject to change based on changes to\nfuture regulations and interpretations.

There is no\nlimit under this shelf registration to the\namount or number of such securities that we\nmay offer and sell, subject to market\nconditions. In addition, we also maintain a\nshelf registration that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $25 billion\nof securitized debt obligations from our\ncredit card loan securitization trust and a\nshelf registration that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $20 billion\nfrom our auto loan securitization trusts. In\naddition to our issuance capacity under the\nshelf registration statements, we also have\naccess to FHLB advances and the Federal\nReserve Discount Window. The ability to borrow\nutilizing these sources is based on membership\nstatus and the amount is dependent upon the\nBanks\u2019 ability to post collateral. As of June\n30, 2020 , we pledged both loans and\nsecurities to FHLB to secure a maximum\nborrowing capacity of $17.9 billion , of which\n$17.7 billion was still available to us to\nborrow. Our FHLB membership is supported by\nour investment in FHLB stock of $30 million\nand $328 million as of June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively, which was\ndetermined in part based on our outstanding\nadvances. As of June 30, 2020 , we pledged\nloans to secure a borrowing capacity of $22.2\nbillion under the Federal Reserve Discount\nWindow. Our membership with the Federal\nReserve is supported by our investment in\nFederal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3\nbillion as of both June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 . Funding Our primary source of\nfunding comes from deposits, as they are a\nstable and relatively low cost source of\nfunding. In addition to deposits, we raise\nfunding through the issuance of senior and\nsubordinated notes, securitized debt\nobligations, federal funds purchased,\nsecurities loaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, and FHLB advances secured by\ncertain portions of our loan and securities\nportfolios. A key objective in our use of\nthese markets is to maintain access to a\ndiversified mix of wholesale funding sources.\nSee \u201cMD&A\u2014 Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAnalysis \u2014 Funding Sources Composition \u201d for\nadditional information on our primary sources\nof funding.\n                                              \n  54  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents Deposits Table 32 provides a\ncomparison of average balances, interest\nexpense and average deposit interest rates for\nthe second quarter and first six months of\n2020 and 2019 .\nTable 32 : Deposits Composition and Average   \nDeposits Interest Rates                       \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n                    \u2026                    \u2026    \n      $      $      \u2026      $      $      \u2026    \n                                              \n__________                                    \n                                              \n  (1)  Includes negotiable order of           \n       withdrawal accounts.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  (2)  Includes money market deposit          \n       accounts.                              \n                                              \nThe FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered\ndeposits to well-capitalized insured\ndepository institutions and, with a waiver\nfrom the FDIC, to adequately-capitalized\ninstitutions.

We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments, including\ncaps, floors, options, futures and forward\ncontracts. We use various industry standard\nmarket risk measurement techniques and\nanalyses to measure, assess and manage the\nimpact of changes in interest rates on our net\ninterest income and our economic value of\nequity and changes in foreign exchange rates\non our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-\ndollar equity investments in foreign\noperations. Net Interest Income Sensitivity\nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact on our projected 12-month\nbaseline interest rate-sensitive revenue\nresulting from movements in interest rates.\nInterest rate-sensitive revenue consists of\nnet interest income and certain components of\nother non-interest income significantly\nimpacted by movements in interest rates,\nincluding changes in the fair value of\nfreestanding interest rate derivatives. In\naddition to our existing assets and\nliabilities, we incorporate expected future\nbusiness growth assumptions, such as loan and\ndeposit growth and pricing, and plans for\nprojected changes in our funding mix in our\nbaseline forecast. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\nprojected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we\nassume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel\nshift in the level of interest rates detailed\nin Table 35 below. At the current level of\ninterest rates, our interest rate sensitive\nrevenue is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate\nscenarios. Our current sensitivity to upward\nshocks has increased relative to December 2019\nmainly due to the decline in interest rates\nand the growth in deposits and cash that we\nexperienced in the first half of 2020.\nEconomic Value of Equity Our economic value of\nequity sensitivity measure estimates the\nimpact on the net present value of our assets\nand liabilities, including derivative\nexposures, resulting from movements in\ninterest rates. Our economic value of equity\nsensitivity measure is calculated based on our\nexisting assets and liabilities, including\nderivatives, and does not incorporate business\ngrowth assumptions or projected balance sheet\nchanges. Key assumptions used in the\ncalculation include projecting rate sensitive\nprepayments for mortgage securities, loans and\nother assets, term structure modeling of\ninterest rates, discount spreads, and deposit\nvolume and pricing assumptions. In measuring\nthe sensitivity of interest rate movements on\nour economic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n35 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity increases in higher\nrate scenarios and decreases in lower interest\nrate scenarios. Similar to the changes in net\ninterest income sensitivity, our current\neconomic value of equity sensitivity to upward\nshocks has also increased since December 2019\nmainly due to the decline in interest rates\nand the growth in deposits and cash that we\nexperienced in the first half of 2020.\n                                              \n  57  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents Table 35 shows the estimated\npercentage impact on our projected baseline\nnet interest income and economic value of\nequity calculated under the methodology\ndescribed above as of June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 .

Limitations of Market\nRisk Measures The interest rate risk models\nthat we use in deriving these measures\nincorporate contractual information,\ninternally-developed assumptions and\nproprietary modeling methodologies, which\nproject borrower and depositor behavior\npatterns in certain interest rate\nenvironments. Other market inputs, such as\ninterest rates, market prices and interest\nrate volatility, are also critical components\nof our interest rate risk measures. We\nregularly evaluate, update and enhance these\nassumptions, models and analytical tools as we\nbelieve appropriate to reflect our best\nassessment of the market environment and the\nexpected behavior patterns of our existing\nassets and liabilities. There are inherent\nlimitations in any methodology used to\nestimate the exposure to changes in market\ninterest rates. The sensitivity analysis\ndescribed above contemplates only certain\nmovements in interest rates and is performed\nat a particular point in time based on the\nexisting balance sheet and, in some cases,\nexpected future business growth and funding\nmix assumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis. For further\ninformation on our interest rate exposures,\nsee \u201c Note 8\u2014Derivative Instruments and\nHedging Activities .\u201d Foreign Exchange Risk\nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to\nchanges in the values of current holdings and\nfuture cash flows denominated in other\ncurrencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in the pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and\nthe Canadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to\nour businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings. Our non-dollar\ndenominated intercompany funding and EUR-\ndenominated borrowings expose our earnings to\nforeign exchange transaction risk. We manage\nthese transaction risks by using forward\nforeign currency derivatives and cross-\ncurrency swaps to hedge our exposures. We\nmeasure our foreign exchange transaction risk\nexposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nintercompany funding outstanding was 516\nmillion GBP and 761 million GBP as of June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively, and\n5.4 billion CAD and 6.6 billion CAD as of June\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively.\nOur EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding\nwere 1.3 billion EUR and 1.2 billion EUR as of\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively.\n                                              \n  58  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents Our non-dollar equity\ninvestments in foreign operations expose our\nbalance sheet to translation risk in AOCI and\nour capital ratios. We manage our AOCI\nexposure by entering into foreign currency\nderivatives designated as net investment\nhedges. We measure these exposures by applying\na 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we\nbelieve approximates a significant adverse\nshock over a one-year time horizon, against\nthe value of the equity invested in our\nforeign operations net of related net\ninvestment hedges where applicable. Our gross\nequity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian\noperations were 1.6 billion GBP as of both\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , and 1.4\nbillion CAD as of both June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 . As a result of our\nderivative management activities, we believe\nour net exposure to foreign exchange risk is\nminimal. Risk related to Customer\nAccommodation Derivatives We offer interest\nrate, commodity and foreign currency\nderivatives as an accommodation to our\ncustomers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ an\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal. For further information on our\nrisk related to customer accommodation\nderivatives, see \u201c Note 8\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities .\u201d London\nInterbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) Transition On\nJuly 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority, the regulator for the\nadministration of LIBOR, announced that LIBOR\nwould be transitioned as an interest rate\nbenchmark and that it will no longer compel\nbanks to contribute LIBOR data beyond December\n31, 2021. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nestablished the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a group of private market\nparticipants and ex-officio members\nrepresenting banking and financial sector\nregulators. The ARRC has recommended the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as\nthe preferred alternative rate for certain\nU.S. dollar derivative and cash instruments.\nWhile the ARRC has recommended SOFR as the\nreplacement rate for LIBOR, there is\nacknowledgment that the development of a\ncredit-sensitive element could be a complement\nto SOFR. It is unclear as to the likelihood\nand timing, but such a development would have\nimpacts to our transition efforts. We have\nexposures to LIBOR, including loans,\nderivative contracts, unsecured debt,\nsecuritizations, vendor agreements and other\ninstruments with attributes that are either\ndirectly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. To\nfacilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR,\nwe have established a company-wide, cross-\nfunctional initiative to oversee and manage\nour transition away from LIBOR and other\nInterbank Offered Rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d) to\nalternative reference rates. We have made\nprogress on our transition efforts as we:\n                                              \n  \u2022  implemented a robust governance          \n     framework and transition planning;       \n                                              \n                                              \n     completed initial assessment of          \n  \u2022  exposures in products, legal contracts,  \n     systems, models and processes;           \n                                              \n                                              \n     included LIBOR transition language       \n  \u2022  (\u201cfallback language\u201d) for new legal      \n     contracts/agreements; and                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  started issuing securities with          \n     SOFR-based features in 2020.             \n                                              \nWe also continue to focus our transition\nefforts on:\n                                              \n     reviewing existing legal                 \n  \u2022  contracts/agreements and assessing       \n     fallback language impacts;               \n                                              \n                                        \n  \u2022  monitoring of our LIBOR exposure;  \n                                        \n                                              \n  \u2022  assessing internal operational           \n     readiness and risk management;           \n                                              \n                                              \n     implementing necessary updates to our    \n  \u2022  infrastructure including systems,        \n     models, valuation tools and processes;   \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2022  engaging with our clients, industry      \n     working groups, and regulators; and      \n                                              \n                                              \n     monitoring developments associated with  \n  \u2022  LIBOR alternatives and industry          \n     practices related to LIBOR-indexed       \n     instruments.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n  59  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents For a further discussion of\nthe various risks we face in connection with\nthe expected replacement of LIBOR on our\noperations, see \u201c Part I \u2014 Item 1A.

The Federal Reserve has required all\nparticipating banks, including us, to update\nand resubmit their capital plans later this\nyear. Pursuant to the Federal Reserve\u2019s\ncapital plan rule, a participating bank, such\nas us, is prohibited from making capital\ndistributions without the prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve following an event\nrequiring the resubmission of its capital\nplan. See \u201cMD&A\u2014 Capital Management \u2014Capital\nPlanning and Regulatory Stress Testing\u201d for\nmore information. Supplementary Leverage Ratio\nIn April 2020, as part of the response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve issued\nan interim final rule that temporarily\nexcludes U.S. Treasury securities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation\nof the supplementary leverage ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d)\nfor bank holding companies. These exclusions\nbecame effective on April 1, 2020, and will\nremain in effect through March 31, 2021. The\nSLR for the Company as of June 30, 2020\nreflects these exclusions. Subsequently, in\nMay 2020, the Federal Banking Agencies issued\nan interim final rule that provides an option\nfor depository institutions to make similar\nexclusions to the calculation of the SLR. If a\ndepository institution elects to make such\nexclusions, it must request prior approval\nfrom its primary federal banking regulator\nbefore making capital distributions, such as\npaying dividends to its parent company, for as\nlong as the exclusions are in effect. Neither\nCONA nor COBNA elected to make such\nexclusions. Accordingly, the SLRs for CONA and\nCOBNA presented in this Report do not reflect\nany such exclusions. Derivatives Activities\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a\nregulatory framework for the governance of the\nover-the-counter derivatives market, including\nswaps and security-based swaps and the\nregistration of certain market participants as\na swap dealer (an \u201cSD\u201d). CONA plans to\nregister with the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) as an SD in the third\nquarter of this year. Registration as an SD\nsubjects CONA to an enhanced and heightened\nregulatory regime with respect to its swaps\nand other derivatives activities. CONA will be\nsubject to the OCC rules concerning capital\nand margin requirements for SDs, including the\nmandatory exchange of variation margin and\ninitial margin with certain counterparties.\nAdditionally, as a provisionally registered\nSD, CONA will be subject to the CFTC\u2019s rules\nregarding business conduct standards,\nrecordkeeping obligations, regulatory\nreporting and procedures relating to swaps\ntrading. CONA\u2019s swaps and other derivatives\nactivities will not require it to register\nwith the SEC as a security-based swap dealer.\nWe provided additional information on our\nSupervision and Regulation in our 2019 Form\n10-K under \u201c Part I \u2014 Item 1.

COEP has authority,\namong other things, to provide credit card\nloans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has\nthe authority to provide credit card loans.\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We\nprovide details on our business segments, the\nintegration of recent acquisitions, if any,\ninto our business segments and the allocation\nmethodologies and accounting policies used to\nderive our business segment results in \u201c Note\n12\u2014Business Segments and Revenue from\nContracts with Customers .\u201d\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates    \nThe accompanying unaudited interim\nconsolidated financial statements have been\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the U.S. (\u201cU.S.\nGAAP\u201d). The preparation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements in conformity with U.S.\nGAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin the consolidated financial statements and\nin the related disclosures. These estimates\nare based on information available as of the\ndate of the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile management makes its best judgments,\nactual amounts or results could differ from\nthese estimates. In the opinion of management,\nall normal, recurring adjustments have been\nincluded for a fair statement of this interim\nfinancial information. Certain prior period\namounts have been reclassified to conform to\nthe current period presentation.\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with\nthe audited consolidated financial statements,\nand related notes thereto, included in Capital\nOne Financial Corporation\u2019s 2019 Annual Report\non Form 10-K (\u201c2019 Form 10-K\u201d).\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rates in the second quarter\nand first six months of 2020 were computed\nutilizing the estimated annual effective tax\nrate method and were driven by the\nrelationship of our tax credits in proportion\nto our pre-tax earnings. We changed our\nmethodology from the year-to-date method\nutilized in the first quarter of 2020 due to\npassage of time as we recorded two quarters of\nactual results that reduced forecast\nvariability for the remainder of the year.\nSignificant Accounting Policies Impacted by\nour Adoption of the CECL Standard\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted ASU\nNo. 2016-13, Financial Instruments\u2014Credit\nLosses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments (\u201cCECL\nstandard\u201d) and updated the below significant\naccounting policies.\n                                              \n  78  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents Investment Securities We\nclassify securities as available for sale or\nheld to maturity based on our investment\nstrategy and management\u2019s assessment of our\nintent and ability to hold the securities\nuntil maturity. We did not have any securities\nthat were classified as held to maturity as of\nJune 30, 2020. We report securities available\nfor sale on our consolidated balance sheets at\nfair value. The amortized cost of investment\nsecurities reflects the amount for which the\nsecurity was acquired, adjusted for accrued\ninterest, amortization of premiums, discounts,\nand net deferred fees and costs, collection of\ncash, and charge-offs. We elect to present\naccrued interest for securities available for\nsale within interest receivable on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains\nor losses are recorded, net of tax, as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Unamortized premiums,\ndiscounts and other basis adjustments for\navailable for sale securities are recognized\nin interest income over the contractual lives\nof the securities using the effective interest\nmethod. We record purchases and sales of\ninvestment securities available for sale on a\ntrade date basis. Realized gains or losses\nfrom the sale of debt securities are computed\nusing the first-in first-out method of\nidentification, and are included in non-\ninterest income in our consolidated statements\nof income. An individual debt security is\nimpaired when the fair value of the security\nis less than its amortized cost. If we intend\nto sell an available for sale security in an\nunrealized loss position or it is more likely\nthan not that we will be required to sell the\nsecurity prior to recovery of its amortized\ncost basis, any allowance for credit losses is\nreversed through our provision for credit\nlosses and the difference between the\namortized cost basis of the security and its\nfair value is recognized in our consolidated\nstatements of income. For impaired debt\nsecurities that we have both the intent and\nability to hold, the securities are evaluated\nto determine if a credit loss exists. The\nallowance for credit losses on our investment\nsecurities is recognized through our provision\nfor credit losses and limited by the\nunrealized losses of a security measured as\nthe difference between the security\u2019s\namortized cost and fair value. See further\ndiscussion below under the \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses - Available for Sale Investment\nSecurities\u201d section of this Note. Our\ninvestment portfolio also includes certain\ndebt securities that, at the time of purchase,\nhad experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. Such debt securities are\naccounted for in accordance with accounting\nguidance for purchased financial assets with\ncredit deterioration and are herein referred\nto as purchased credit-deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d)\nsecurities. PCD securities require the\nrecognition of an allowance for credit losses\nat the time of acquisition. The allowance for\ncredit losses is not recognized in earnings.\nInstead, the purchase price and the initial\nallowance collectively represent the amortized\ncost basis of a PCD security. Any noncredit\ndiscount or premium at the date of acquisition\nis amortized into interest income over the\nremaining life of the security. Subsequent to\nthe date of purchase, we re-measure the\nallowance for credit losses on the amortized\ncost basis using the same policies as for\nother debt securities available for sale and\nchanges are recognized through our provision\nfor credit losses. See further discussion\nbelow under the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses -\nAvailable for Sale Investment Securities\u201d\nsection of this Note. We charge off any\nportion of an investment security that we\ndetermine is uncollectible. The amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, is charged\noff through the allowance for credit losses.\nAccrued interest is charged off as a reduction\nto interest income. Recoveries of previously\ncharged off principal amounts are recognized\nin our provision for credit losses when\nreceived. Loans Our loan portfolio consists of\nloans held for investment, including loans\nunderlying our consolidated securitization\ntrusts, and loans held for sale and is divided\ninto three portfolio segments: credit card,\nconsumer banking and commercial banking loans.\nCredit card loans consist of domestic and\ninternational credit card loans. Consumer\nbanking loans consist of auto and retail\nbanking loans. Commercial banking loans\nconsist of commercial and multifamily real\nestate as well as commercial and industrial\nloans. Loan Classification Upon origination or\npurchase, we classify loans as held for\ninvestment or held for sale based on our\ninvestment strategy and management\u2019s intent\nand ability with regard to the loans, which\nmay change over time. The accounting and\nmeasurement framework for loans differs\ndepending on the loan classification, whether\nwe elect the fair value option, whether the\nloans are originated or purchased and whether\npurchased loans are considered to have\nexperienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination. The presentation within the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows is based\non management\u2019s intent at acquisition\n                                              \n  79  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents or origination. Cash flows\nrelated to loans that are acquired or\noriginated with the intent to hold for\ninvestment are included in cash flows from\ninvesting activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Cash flows related\nto loans that are acquired or originated with\nthe intent to sell are included in cash flows\nfrom operating activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Loans Held for\nInvestment Loans that we have the ability and\nintent to hold for the foreseeable future and\nloans associated with consolidated\nsecuritization transactions are classified as\nheld for investment. Loans classified as held\nfor investment, except for credit card loans,\nare reported at their amortized cost basis,\nexcluding accrued interest. For these loans,\nwe elect to present accrued interest within\ninterest receivable in our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For credit card loans, billed\nfinance charges and fees are included in loans\nheld for investment. Unbilled finance charges\nand fees on credit card loans are included in\ninterest receivable. Interest income is\nrecognized on performing loans held for\ninvestment on an accrual basis. We defer loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts on originated loans, premiums and\ndiscounts on purchased loans and loan\ncommitment fees. We recognize these amounts in\ninterest income as yield adjustments over the\nlife of the loan and/or commitment period\nusing the effective interest method. For\ncredit card loans, loan origination fees and\ndirect loan origination costs are amortized on\na straight-line basis over a 12 -month period.\nThe amortized cost of loans held for\ninvestment is subject to our allowance for\ncredit losses methodology described below\nunder the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note.\nLoans Held for Sale Loans purchased or\noriginated with the intent to sell or for\nwhich we do not have the ability and intent to\nhold for the foreseeable future are classified\nas held for sale. Multifamily commercial real\nestate loans originated with the intent to\nsell to government-sponsored enterprises are\naccounted for under the fair value option. We\nelect the fair value option on these loans as\npart of our management of interest rate risk\nwith corresponding forward sale commitments.\nLoan origination fees and direct loan\norigination costs are recognized as incurred\nand are reported in other non-interest income\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nInterest income is calculated based on the\nloan's stated rate of interest and is reported\nin interest income in the consolidated\nstatements of income. Fair value adjustments\nare recorded in other non-interest income in\nthe consolidated statements of income. All\nother loans classified as held for sale are\nrecorded at the lower of cost or fair value.\nLoan origination fees, direct loan origination\ncosts and any discounts and premiums are\ndeferred until the loan is sold and are then\nrecognized as part of the total gain or loss\non sale. The fair value of loans held for sale\nis determined on an aggregate portfolio basis\nfor each loan type. Fair value adjustments are\nrecorded in other non-interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of income. If a loan\nis transferred from held for investment to\nheld for sale, then on the transfer date, any\ndecline in fair value related to credit is\nrecorded as a charge-off and any allowance for\ncredit losses is reversed through our\nprovision for credit losses. The loan is then\nreclassified to held for sale at its amortized\ncost at the date of the transfer. A valuation\nallowance is established, if needed, such that\nthe loan held for sale is recorded at the\nlower of cost or fair value. Subsequent to\ntransfer, we report write-downs or recoveries\nin fair value up to the carrying value at the\ndate of transfer and realized gains or losses\non loans held for sale in our consolidated\nstatements of income as a component of other\nnon-interest income. We calculate the gain or\nloss on loan sales as the difference between\nthe proceeds received and the carrying value\nof the loans sold, net of the fair value of\nany residual interests retained. Loans\nAcquired All purchased loans, including loans\ntransferred in a business combination, are\ninitially recorded at fair value, which\nincludes consideration of expected future\nlosses, as of the date of the acquisition. To\ndetermine the fair value of loans at\nacquisition, we estimate discounted\ncontractual cash flows due using an observable\nmarket rate of interest, when available,\nadjusted for factors that a market participant\nwould consider in determining fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, contractual cash flows\nare adjusted to include prepayment estimates\nbased upon historical payment trends,\nforecasted default rates and loss severities\nand other relevant factors. The difference\nbetween the fair value and the contractual\ncash flows is recorded as a loan premium or\ndiscount, which may relate to either credit or\nnon-credit factors, at acquisition. We account\nfor purchased loans under the accounting\nguidance for purchased financial assets with\ncredit deterioration when, at the time of\npurchase, the loans have experienced a more-\nthan-insignificant deterioration in credit\nquality since origination. We also account for\nloans under this guidance when the loans were\npreviously accounted for under the accounting\nguidance for purchased credit impaired loans\nand debt securities (\u201cPCI\u201d) prior to our\nadoption of Accounting Standards Codification\n(\u201cASC\u201d)\n                                              \n  80  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents 326, Financial Instruments -\nCredit Losses , on January 1, 2020. We refer\nto these loans which are accounted for under\naccounting guidance for purchased financial\nassets with more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since\norigination as \u201cPCD loans\u201d. We recognize an\nallowance for credit losses on purchased loans\nthat have not experienced a more-than-\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination at the time of purchase\nthrough earnings in a manner that is\nconsistent with originated loans. The policies\nrelating to the allowance for credit losses on\nloans is described below in the \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses - Loans Held for Investment\u201d\nsection of this Note. Loan Modifications and\nRestructurings As part of our loss mitigation\nefforts, we may provide modifications to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty to\nimprove long-term collectability of the loan\nand to avoid the need for foreclosure or\nrepossession of collateral, if any. Our loan\nmodifications typically include short-term\npayment deferrals, an extension of the loan\nterm, a reduction in the interest rate, a\nreduction in the loan balance, or a\ncombination of these concessions. A loan\nmodification in which a concession is granted\nto a borrower experiencing financial\ndifficulty is accounted for and reported as a\ntroubled debt restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d). See \u201c\nNote 3\u2014Loans \u201d for additional information on\nour loan modifications and restructurings,\nincluding those in response to the COVID-19\npandemic. Delinquent and Nonperforming Loans\nThe entire balance of a loan is considered\ncontractually delinquent if the minimum\nrequired payment is not received by the first\nstatement cycle date equal to or following the\ndue date specified on the customer\u2019s billing\nstatement. Delinquency is reported on loans\nthat are 30 or more days past due. Interest\nand fees continue to accrue on past due loans\nuntil the date the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, if applicable. For loan\nmodifications, delinquency and nonaccrual\nstatus are reported in accordance with the\nrevised terms of the loans. We generally place\nloans on nonaccrual status when we believe the\ncollectability of interest and principal is\nnot reasonably assured. Nonperforming loans\ngenerally include loans that have been placed\non nonaccrual status. We do not report loans\nclassified as held for sale as nonperforming.\nOur policies for classifying loans as\nnonperforming, by loan category, are as\nfollows: \u2022 Credit card loans: As permitted by\nregulatory guidance issued by the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council\n(\u201cFFIEC\u201d), our policy is generally to exempt\ncredit card loans from being classified as\nnonperforming, as these loans are generally\ncharged off in the period the account becomes\n180 days past due. Consistent with industry\nconventions, we generally continue to accrue\ninterest and fees on delinquent credit card\nloans until the loans are charged off. \u2022\nConsumer banking loans: We classify consumer\nbanking loans as nonperforming when we\ndetermine that the collectability of all\ninterest and principal on the loan is not\nreasonably assured, generally when the loan\nbecomes 90 days past due. \u2022 Commercial banking\nloans : We classify commercial banking loans\nas nonperforming as of the date we determine\nthat the collectability of all interest and\nprincipal on the loan is not reasonably\nassured. \u2022 Modified loans and troubled debt\nrestructurings: Modified loans, including\nTDRs, that are current at the time of the\nrestructuring remain on accrual status if\nthere is demonstrated performance prior to the\nrestructuring and continued performance under\nthe modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the\nmodified loan is classified as nonperforming.\nInterest and fees accrued but not collected at\nthe date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status\nare reversed against earnings. In addition,\nthe amortization of deferred loan fees, costs,\npremiums and discounts is suspended. Interest\nand fee income are subsequently recognized\nonly upon the receipt of cash payments.\nHowever, if there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectability of loan principal,\ncash received is generally applied against the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status\nwhen all principal and interest is current and\nrepayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest is reasonably assured,\nor when the loan is both well-secured and in\nthe process of collection and collectability\nis no longer doubtful. Charge-Offs - Loans\n                                              \n  81  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents We charge off loans when we\ndetermine that the loan is uncollectible. The\namortized cost basis, excluding accrued\ninterest, is charged off as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses based on the time\nframes presented below. Accrued interest on\nloans other than credit card loans determined\nto be uncollectible is reversed as a reduction\nof interest income when the loan is classified\nas nonperforming. For credit card loans,\naccrued interest is charged off simultaneously\nwith the charge off of other components of\namortized cost and as a reduction of interest\nincome. When received, recoveries of\npreviously charged off amounts are recorded as\nan increase to the allowance for credit losses\n(see the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note for\ninformation on how we account for expected\nrecoveries). Costs to recover charged off\nloans are recorded as collection expense and\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense as incurred. Our charge-off time\nframes by loan type are presented below. \u2022\nCredit card loans : We generally charge off\ncredit card loans in the period the account\nbecomes 180 days past due. We charge off\ndelinquent credit card loans for which\nrevolving privileges have been revoked as part\nof loan workout when the account becomes 120\ndays past due. Credit card loans in bankruptcy\nare generally charged off by the end of the\nmonth following 30 days after the receipt of a\ncomplete bankruptcy notification from the\nbankruptcy court. Credit card loans of\ndeceased account holders are generally charged\noff 5 days after receipt of notification. \u2022\nConsumer banking loans: We generally charge\noff consumer banking loans at the earlier of\nthe date when the account is a specified\nnumber of days past due or upon repossession\nof the underlying collateral. Our charge-off\nperiod for auto loans is 120 days past due.\nSmall business banking loans generally charge\noff at 120 days past due based on the date the\namortized cost basis is deemed uncollectible.\nAuto loans that have not been previously\ncharged off where the borrower has filed for\nbankruptcy and the loan has not been\nreaffirmed charge off in the period that the\nloan is 60 days from the bankruptcy\nnotification date, regardless of delinquency\nstatus. Auto loans that have not been\npreviously charged off and have been\ndischarged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are\ncharged off at the end of the month in which\nthe bankruptcy discharge occurs. Remaining\nconsumer loans generally are charged off\nwithin 40 days of receipt of notification from\nthe bankruptcy court. Consumer loans of\ndeceased account holders are charged off by\nthe end of the month following 60 days of\nreceipt of notification. \u2022 Commercial banking\nloans: We charge off commercial loans in the\nperiod we determine that the amortized cost\nbasis is uncollectible. Allowance for Credit\nLosses We maintain an allowance for credit\nlosses (\u201callowance\u201d) that represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment and investment\nsecurities classified as available for sale.\nWe measure the allowance on a quarterly basis\nthrough consideration of past events,\nincluding historical experience, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment We measure current\nexpected credit losses over the contractual\nterms of our loans. The contractual terms are\nadjusted for expected prepayments but are not\nextended for renewals or extensions, except\nwhen an extension or renewal arises from a\nborrower option that is not unconditionally\ncancellable or through a TDR that is\nreasonably expected to occur. We aggregate\nloans sharing similar risk characteristics\ninto pools for purposes of measuring expected\ncredit losses. Pools are reassessed\nperiodically to confirm that all loans within\neach pool continue to share similar risk\ncharacteristics. Expected credit losses for\nloans that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics with other financial assets\nare measured individually. Expected recoveries\nof amounts previously charged off or expected\nto be charged off are recognized within the\nallowance, with a corresponding reduction to\nour provision for credit losses. At times\nexpected recoveries may result in a negative\nallowance. We limit the allowance to amounts\npreviously charged off and expected to be\ncharged off. Charge-offs of uncollectible\namounts result in a reduction to the allowance\nand recoveries of previously charged off\namounts result in an increase to the\nallowance. When developing an estimate of\nexpected credit losses, we use both\nquantitative and qualitative methods in\nconsidering all available information relevant\nto assessing collectability. This may include\ninternal information, external information, or\na combination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Significant judgment is\napplied to the development and duration of\nreasonable and supportable forecasts used in\nour estimation of lifetime losses. We estimate\nexpected\n                                              \n  82  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents credit losses over the\nduration of those forecasts and then revert,\non a rational and systematic basis, to\nhistorical losses at each relevant loss\ncomponent of the estimate. Expected losses for\ncontractual terms extending beyond the\nreasonable and supportable forecast and\nreversion periods are based on those\nhistorical losses. Management will consider\nand may qualitatively adjust for conditions,\nchanges, and trends in loan portfolios that\nmay not be captured in modeled results. These\nadjustments are referred to as qualitative\nfactors and represent management\u2019s judgment of\nthe imprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses. Management\u2019s\njudgment may involve an assessment of current\nand forward-looking conditions including but\nnot limited to changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, nature and volume of the\nportfolio, external factors, and uncertainty\nas it relates to economic, model or forecast\nrisks, where not already captured in the\nmodeled results. Expected credit losses for\ncollateral-dependent loans are based on the\nfair value of the underlying collateral. When\nwe intend to liquidate the collateral, the\nfair value of the collateral is adjusted for\nexpected costs to sell. A loan is deemed to be\na collateral-dependent loan when (i) we\ndetermine foreclosure or repossession of the\nunderlying collateral is probable, or (ii)\nforeclosure or repossession is not probable,\nbut the borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty and we expect repayment to be\nprovided substantially through the operation\nor sale of the collateral. The allowance for a\ncollateral-dependent loan reflects the\ndifference between the loan\u2019s amortized cost\nbasis and the fair value (less selling costs,\nwhere applicable) of the loan's underlying\ncollateral. Our credit card and consumer\nbanking loan portfolios consist of smaller-\nbalance, homogeneous loans. The consumer\nbanking loan portfolio is divided into two\nprimary portfolio segments: auto loans and\nretail banking loans. The credit card and\nconsumer banking loan portfolios are further\ndivided by our business units into groups\nbased on common risk characteristics, such as\norigination year, contract type, interest\nrate, credit bureau score and geography. The\ncommercial banking loan portfolio is primarily\ncomposed of larger-balance, non-homogeneous\nloans. These loans are subject to reviews that\nresult in internal risk ratings. In assessing\nthe risk rating of a particular commercial\nbanking loan, among the factors we consider\nare the financial condition of the borrower,\ngeography, collateral performance, historical\nloss experience and industry-specific\ninformation that management believes is\nrelevant in determining and measuring expected\ncredit losses. Subjective assessment and\ninterpretation are involved. Emphasizing one\nfactor over another or considering additional\nfactors could impact the risk rating assigned\nto that commercial banking loan. For consumer\nbanking and commercial banking loans, the\ncontractual period typically does not include\nrenewals or extensions because the renewals\nand extensions are generally not at the\nborrower\u2019s exclusive option to exercise.\nManagement has determined that the undrawn\ncredit exposure that is associated with our\ncredit card loans is unconditionally\ncancellable. For this reason, expected credit\nlosses are measured based on the drawn balance\nat each quarterly measurement date, but not on\nthe undrawn exposure. Because credit card\nloans do not have a defined contractual life,\nmanagement estimates both the volume and\napplication of payments to determine a\ncontractual life of the drawn balance at the\nmeasurement date over which expected credit\nlosses are developed for credit card loans.\nWith the exception of credit card loans, we\nhave made a policy election to not measure an\nallowance on accrued interest for loans held\nfor investment because we reverse\nuncollectible accrued interest in a timely\nmanner. See the \u201cDelinquent and Nonperforming\nLoans\u201d and \u201cCharge-Offs - Loans\u201d sections of\nthis Note for information on what we consider\ntimely. For credit card loans, we do not make\nthis election, as we reserve for uncollectible\naccrued interest relating to credit card loans\nin the allowance. The allowance related to\ncredit card and consumer banking loans\nassessed on a pooled basis is based on a\nmodeled calculation, which is supplemented by\nmanagement judgment as described above.\nBecause of the homogeneous nature of our\nconsumer loan portfolios, the allowance is\nbased on the aggregated portfolio segment\nevaluations. The allowance is established\nthrough a process that begins with estimates\nof historical losses in each pool based upon\nvarious statistical analyses, with adjustments\nfor current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of conditions, which\nincludes expected economic conditions. Loss\nforecast models are utilized to estimate\nexpected credit losses and consider several\nportfolio indicators including, but not\nlimited to, expected economic conditions,\nhistorical loss experience, account seasoning,\nthe value of collateral underlying secured\nloans, estimated foreclosures or defaults\nbased on observable trends, delinquencies,\nbankruptcy filings, unemployment, credit\nbureau scores and general business trends.\nManagement believes these factors are relevant\nin estimating expected credit losses and also\nconsiders an evaluation of overall portfolio\ncredit quality based on indicators such as\nchanges in our credit evaluation, underwriting\nand collection management policies, the effect\nof other external factors such as competition\nand legal and regulatory requirements, general\neconomic conditions and business trends, and\nuncertainties in forecasting and modeling\ntechniques used in estimating our allowance.\n                                              \n  83  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents The allowance related to\ncommercial banking loans assessed on a pooled\nbasis is based on our historical loss\nexperience for loans with similar risk\ncharacteristics and consideration of the\ncurrent credit quality of the portfolio, which\nis supplemented by management judgment as\ndescribed above. These are adjusted for\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of conditions likely to\ncause future losses which vary from historical\nlevels. We apply internal risk ratings to\ncommercial banking loans, which we use to\nassess credit quality and derive a total loss\nestimate based on an estimated probability of\ndefault (\u201cdefault rate\u201d) and loss given\ndefault (\u201closs severity\u201d). Management may also\napply judgment to adjust the loss factors\nderived, taking into consideration both\nquantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding general economic conditions,\nindustry-specific and geographic trends,\nportfolio concentrations, trends in internal\ncredit quality indicators, and current and\npast underwriting standards that have occurred\nbut are not yet reflected in the historical\ndata underlying our loss estimates. The\nallowance related to smaller-balance\nhomogeneous credit card and consumer banking\nloans whose terms have been modified in a TDR\nis calculated on a pool basis using historical\nloss experience, adjusted for current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of conditions likely to cause future\nlosses which vary from historical levels for\nthe respective class of assets. The allowance\nrelated to consumer banking loans that are\nassessed at a loan-level is determined based\non key considerations that include the\nborrower\u2019s overall financial condition,\nresources and payment history, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, and when applicable, the estimated\nrealizable value of any collateral. The\nallowance related to commercial banking loans\nthat are assessed at a loan-level is generally\ndetermined in accordance with our policy for\nestimating expected credit losses for\ncollateral-dependent loans as described above.\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures In addition\nto the allowance, we also measure expected\ncredit losses related to unfunded lending\ncommitments that are not unconditionally\ncancellable in our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. This reserve is measured using the\nsame measurement objectives as the allowance\nfor loans held for investment and is recorded\nwithin other liabilities on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. These commitments are\nsegregated by risk according to our internal\nrisk rating scale, which we use to assess\ncredit quality and derive an expected credit\nloss estimate. We assess these risk\nclassifications, taking into consideration\nboth quantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of conditions likely to\ncause future losses which vary from historical\nlevels, and utilization assumptions to\nestimate the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Expected credit losses are not\nmeasured on unfunded lending commitments that\nare unconditionally cancellable, including all\nof our unfunded credit card and consumer\nbanking lending commitments and certain of our\nunfunded commercial banking lending\ncommitments. Determining the appropriateness\nof the allowance and the reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments is complex and requires\njudgment by management about the effect of\nmatters that are inherently uncertain.\nSubsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio,\nin light of the factors then prevailing, may\nresult in significant changes in the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments in future\nperiods. See \u201c Note 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments \u201d for additional information.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Available for\nSale Investment Securities When an investment\nsecurity available for sale is impaired due to\ncredit factors, we recognize a provision for\ncredit losses on our consolidated statements\nof income and an allowance for credit losses\non the consolidated balance sheet. Credit\nlosses recognized in the allowance for credit\nlosses are limited to the amount by which the\ninvestment security\u2019s amortized cost basis\nexceeds its fair value. Investment securities\nin unrealized gain positions do not have an\nallowance for credit losses as the investment\nsecurity could be sold at its fair value to\nprevent realization of credit losses. We\nexclude accrued interest from the fair value\nand amortized cost basis of an investment\nsecurity for purposes of measuring impairment.\nCharge-offs of uncollectible amounts of\ninvestment securities are deducted from the\nallowance for credit losses. For certain of\nour securities available for sale, we have\ndetermined that there is no risk of impairment\ndue to credit factors. These investment\nsecurities include high quality debt\ninstruments that are issued and guaranteed by\nthe United States government and its agencies\nor are issued through certain government-\nsponsored enterprises. Management performs\nperiodic assessments to reevaluate this\nconclusion by considering any changes in\nhistorical losses, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. We\nevaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at\nthe individual security level and determine\nwhether any portion of the decline in fair\nvalue is due to a credit loss. We make this\ndetermination through the use of quantitative\nand qualitative analyses. Our qualitative\nanalysis includes factors such as the extent\nto which fair value is less than amortized\ncost, any changes in the security\u2019s credit\n                                              \n  84  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents rating, past defaults or\ndelayed payments, and adverse conditions\nimpacting the security or issuer. A credit\nloss exists to the extent that management does\nnot expect to recover the amortized cost\nbasis. For investment securities which require\nfurther assessment, we perform a quantitative\nanalysis using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology and compare the present value of\nexpected future cash flows from the security\navailable for sale to the security\u2019s amortized\ncost basis. Projected future cash flows\nreflect management\u2019s best estimate and is\nbased on our understanding of past events,\ncurrent conditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts, and are discounted by the\nsecurity\u2019s effective interest rate adjusted\nfor expected prepayments. The allowance for\ncredit losses for investment securities\nreflects the difference by which the amortized\ncost basis exceeds the present value of future\ncash flows and is limited to the amount by\nwhich the security\u2019s amortized cost exceeds\nits fair value. See \u201c Note 2\u2014Investment\nSecurities \u201d for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition Interest Income and Fees\nInterest income and fees on loans and\ninvestment securities are recognized based on\nthe contractual provisions of the underlying\narrangements. Loan origination fees and costs\nand premiums and discounts on loans held for\ninvestment are deferred and generally\namortized into interest income as yield\nadjustments over the contractual life and/or\ncommitment period using the effective interest\nmethod. Costs deferred include direct\norigination costs such as bounties paid to\nthird parties for new accounts and incentives\npaid to our network of auto dealers for loan\nreferrals. In certain circumstances, we elect\nto factor prepayment estimates into the\ncalculation of the constant effective yield\nnecessary to apply the interest method.\nPrepayment estimates are based on historical\nprepayment data, existing and forecasted\ninterest rates, and economic data. For credit\ncard loans, loan origination fees and direct\nloan origination costs are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over a 12 -month period.\nUnamortized premiums, discounts and other\nbasis adjustments on investment securities are\nrecognized in interest income over the\ncontractual lives of the securities using the\neffective interest method. Finance charges and\nfees on credit card loans are recorded in\nrevenue when earned. Billed finance charges\nand fees on credit card loans are included in\nloan receivables. Unbilled finance charges and\nfees on credit card loans are included in\ninterest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. Annual membership fees are\nclassified as service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees on our consolidated\nstatements of income and are deferred and\namortized into income over 12 months on a\nstraight-line basis. We continue to accrue\nfinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nuntil the account is charged off.\n                                              \n  85  Capital One Financial Corporation       \n      (COF)                                   \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nNewly Adopted Accounting Standards During the \nSix Months Ended June 30, 2020                \n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                 Aligns the                   \n                 requiremen\u2026                  \n                 for                          \n                 capitalizi\u2026                  \n  Cloud          implementa\u2026                  \n  Computing      costs          We adopted    \n  ASU No.        incurred in    this          \n  2018-15,       a hosting      guidance in   \n  Intangible\u2026    arrangement    the first     \n  and            that is a      quarter of    \n  Other\u2014Inte\u2026    service        2020 using    \n  Software       contract       the           \n  (Subtopic      with the       prospective   \n  350-40):Cu\u2026    requiremen\u2026    method of     \n  Accounting     for            adoption.     \n  for            capitalizi\u2026    Our adoption  \n  Implementa\u2026    implementa\u2026    of this       \n  Costs          costs          standard did  \n  Incurred in    incurred to    not have a    \n  a Cloud        develop or     material      \n  Computing      obtain         impact on     \n  Arrangement    internal-u\u2026    our           \n  That Is a      software       consolidated  \n  Service        (and           financial     \n  Contract       hosting        statements.   \n  Issued         arrangemen\u2026                  \n  August 2018    that                         \n                 include an                   \n                 internal-u\u2026                  \n                 software                     \n                 license).                    \n                 Historical                   \n                 guidance                     \n                 for                          \n                 goodwill                     \n                 impairment                   \n                 testing                      \n                 prescribed                   \n                 that the                     \n                 company                      \n                 must                         \n                 compare                      \n                 each                         \n                 reporting                    \n                 unit\u2019s                       \n                 carrying                     \n                 value to                     \n                 its fair                     \n                 value.

(\u201cRMBS\u201d), Agency\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities\n(\u201cCMBS\u201d), and other securities. Agency\nsecurities include Government National\nMortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d) guaranteed\nsecurities, Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home\nLoan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d)\nissued securities. The carrying value of our\ninvestments in U.S. Treasury and Agency\nsecurities represented 97% and 96% of our\ntotal investment securities portfolio as of\nJune 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the\nCECL standard. For purchased credit-\ndeteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d) securities, this resulted\nin an increase of their amortized cost basis\nand related allowance for credit losses.\nHowever, the allowance for credit losses for\nPCD securities is limited to the amount by\nwhich the amortized cost basis of the PCD\nsecurity exceeds its fair value. This\nlimitation resulted in an increase of $\n11million to our retained earnings with a\ncorresponding decrease in AOCI at adoption. We\nexclude accrued interest receivable from the\namortized cost disclosed in this note. Our\ndisclosures below reflect these adoption\nchanges. Prior period presentation was not\nreclassified to conform to the current period\npresentation.

The key\nindicator we assess in monitoring the credit\nquality and risk of our credit card loan\nportfolio is delinquency trends, including an\nanalysis of loan migration between delinquency\ncategories over time.\nThe table below presents our credit card\nportfolio by delinquency status as of June 30,\n2020 .\nTable 3.3 : Credit Card Delinquency Status    \n                                              \n               June                           \n                30,                           \n               2020                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                          Revo\u2026               \n  (Do\u2026       Revol\u2026       Loans               \n  in          Loans       Conv\u2026        Total  \n  mil\u2026                       to               \n                           Term               \n  Cre\u2026                                        \n  Car\u2026                                        \n  Dom\u2026                                        \n  cre\u2026                                        \n  car\u2026                                        \n  Cur\u2026    $  96,000    $    666    $  96,666  \n  30-\u2026          637          31          668  \n  days                                        \n  60-\u2026          532          22          554  \n  days                                        \n  Gre\u2026                                        \n  than        1,475          27        1,502  \n  90                                          \n  days                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  dom\u2026       98,644         746       99,390  \n  cre\u2026                                        \n  card                                        \n  Int\u2026                                        \n  card                                        \n  bus\u2026                                        \n  Cur\u2026        7,625          64        7,689  \n  30-\u2026           66          10           76  \n  days                                        \n  60-\u2026           43          11           54  \n  days                                        \n  Gre\u2026                                        \n  than           87          14          101  \n  90                                          \n  days                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  int\u2026        7,821          99        7,920  \n  card                                        \n  bus\u2026                                        \n  Tot\u2026                                        \n  cre\u2026    $  106,4\u2026    $    845    $  107,3\u2026  \n  card                                        \n                                              \nConsumer Banking Our consumer banking loan\nportfolio consists of auto and retail banking\nloans.

The key indicator we monitor when\nassessing the credit quality and risk of our\nauto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores\nas they measure the creditworthiness of\nborrowers.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n                                              \n     Noncriticized:Loans that have not been   \n  \u2022  designated as criticized, frequently     \n     referred to as \u201cpass\u201d loans.             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Criticized performing:Loans in which     \n     the financial condition of the obligor   \n     is stressed, affecting earnings, cash    \n     flows or collateral values. The          \n  \u2022  borrower currently has adequate          \n     capacity to meet near-term obligations;  \n     however, the stress, left unabated, may  \n     result in deterioration of the           \n     repayment prospects at some future       \n     date.                                    \n                                              \n                                              \n     Criticized nonperforming:Loans that are  \n     not adequately protected by the current  \n     net worth and paying capacity of the     \n     obligor or the collateral pledged, if    \n     any. Loans classified as criticized      \n     nonperforming have a well-defined        \n  \u2022  weakness, or weaknesses, which           \n     jeopardize the full repayment of the     \n     debt. These loans are characterized by   \n     the distinct possibility that we will    \n     sustain a credit loss if the             \n     deficiencies are not corrected and are   \n     generally placed on nonaccrual status.   \n                                              \nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses for commercial loans. Generally,\nloans that are designated as criticized\nperforming and criticized nonperforming are\nreviewed quarterly by management to determine\nif they are appropriately classified/rated and\nwhether any impairment exists.

Concurrent with our adoption\nof the CECL standard in the first quarter of\n2020, we reclassified our finance charge and\nfee reserve to our allowance for credit\nlosses, with a corresponding increase to\ncredit card loans held for investment.\nAccordingly, our disclosures below reflect\nthese adoption changes. Prior period\npresentation was not modified to conform to\nthe current period presentation. See \u201cNote\n1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d\nfor additional information.\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. When developing an estimate of\nexpected credit losses, we use both\nquantitative and qualitative methods in\nconsidering all available information relevant\nto assessing collectability. This may include\ninternal information, external information, or\na combination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes, and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nSignificant judgment is applied in our\nestimation of lifetime credit losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for   \nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity         \nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2020 and 2019 . The allowance balance\nas of June 30, 2020 reflects the cumulative\neffects from adoption of the CECL standard and\nthe change to include finance charge and fee\nreserve in the allowance for credit losses.\nThe reserve for unfunded lending commitments\nbalance as of June 30, 2020 also reflects the\ncumulative effects from adoption of the CECL\nstandard, including the component of loss\nsharing agreements with the GSEs on\nmultifamily commercial real estate loans that\nare within the scope of the CECL standard.\nWhen developing an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. Management will consider and\nmay make adjustments for qualitative factors,\nwhich represent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses. Our allowance\nfor credit losses increased by $ 9.6billion to\n$ 16.8billion as of June 30, 2020 from\nDecember 31, 2019 , primarily driven by the\nallowance build from expectations of economic\nworsening and uncertainty as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic as well as the adoption of\nthe CECL standard.\n                                              \n  98  Capital One Financial

have certain credit card partnership\nagreements that are presented within our\nconsolidated financial statements on a net\nbasis, in which our partner agrees to share a\nportion of the credit losses on the underlying\nloan portfolio. The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and provision for credit losses.\nSee \u201c Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies \u201d in our 2019 Form

transactions with\nentities that are considered to be VIEs. Our\nprimary involvement with VIEs has been related\nto our securitization transactions in which we\ntransferred assets to securitization trusts.\nWe have primarily securitized credit card and\nauto loans, which have provided a source of\nfunding for us and enabled us to transfer a\ncertain portion of the economic risk of the\nloans or related debt securities to third\nparties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet our maximum remaining funding\nobligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nvariable interest, aggregated based on VIEs\nwith similar characteristics as of June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 . We separately\npresent information for consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1 : Carrying Amount of Consolidated   \nand Unconsolidated VIEs                       \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       18       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       69       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       87       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  102  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026        7       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       69       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       76       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________                                    \n                                              \n       Represents the carrying amount of      \n       assets and liabilities owned by the    \n  (1)  VIE, which includes the seller\u2019s       \n       interest and repurchased notes held    \n       by other related parties.              \n                                              \n                                              \n       In certain investment structures, we   \n       consolidate a VIE which in turn holds  \n       as its primary asset an investment in  \n       an unconsolidated VIE. In these        \n       instances, we disclose the carrying    \n       amount of assets and liabilities on    \n       our consolidated balance sheets as     \n       unconsolidated VIEs to avoid           \n       duplicating our exposure, as the       \n  (2)  unconsolidated VIEs are generally the  \n       operating entities generating the      \n       exposure.

We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to securitization\ntrusts of government-sponsored enterprises\n(\u201cGSEs\u201d). We retain the related Mortgage\nservicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service the\ntransferred loans pursuant to the guidelines\nset forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold\nprimarily RMBS and CMBS in our investment\nsecurities portfolio, which represent variable\ninterests in the respective securitization\ntrusts from which those securities were\nissued. We do not consolidate the\nsecuritization trusts employed in these\ntransactions as we do not have the power to\ndirect the activities that most significantly\nimpact the economic performance of these\nsecuritization trusts. Our maximum exposure to\nloss as a result of our involvement with these\nVIEs is the carrying value of MSRs and\ncontractual obligations under loss sharing\narrangements as well as investment securities\non our consolidated balance sheets. See \u201c Note\n6\u2014Goodwill and Intangible Assets \u201d for\ninformation related to our MSRs associated\nwith these securitizations and \u201c Note\n2\u2014Investment Securities \u201d for more information\non the securities held in our investment\nsecurities portfolio. We exclude these VIEs\nfrom the tables within this note because we do\nnot consider our continuing involvement with\nthese VIEs to be significant as we either\ninvest in securities issued by the VIE and\nwere not involved in the design of the VIE or\nno transfers have occurred between the VIE and\nus. In addition, where we have certain lending\narrangements in the normal course of business\nwith entities that could be VIEs, we have also\nexcluded these VIEs from the tables presented\nin this note.

Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nAuto Securitizations\n\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritization involves the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nMortgage Securitizations\n\nWe had previously securitized mortgage loans\nby transferring these loans to securitization\ntrusts that had issued mortgage-backed\nsecurities to investors. These mortgage trusts\nconsist of option-adjustable rate mortgage\n(\u201coption-ARM\u201d) securitizations and\nsecuritizations from our discontinued\noperations which include the mortgage\norigination operations of our wholesale\nmortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage\nFunding, Inc. (\u201cGreenPoint\u201d) and the\nmanufactured housing operations of GreenPoint\nCredit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint\n(collectively \u201cGreenPoint securitizations\u201d).\nWe retain rights to certain future cash flows\narising from these securitizations. We do not\nconsolidate the mortgage securitizations\nbecause we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of the trusts, and the\nright to receive the benefits or the\nobligation to absorb losses that could\npotentially be significant to the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are\n                                              \n  104  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents financed with a combination\nof invested equity capital and debt. We\naccount for certain of our investments in\nqualified affordable housing projects using\nthe proportional amortization method if\ncertain criteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the six months ended June 30,\n2020 and 2019 , we recognized amortization of\n$ 285million and $ 279million , respectively,\nand tax credits of $ 622million and $\n355million , respectively, associated with\nthese investments within income tax provision\nor benefit. The carrying value of our equity\ninvestments in these qualified affordable\nhousing projects was $ 4.5billion and $\n4.4billion as of June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 , respectively. We are periodically\nrequired to provide additional financial or\nother support during the period of the\ninvestments. Our liability for these unfunded\ncommitments was $ 1.5billion as of both June\n30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , and is\nlargely expected to be paid from 2020 to 2022\n. For those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.6billion as of both June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 . The creditors of the VIEs\nhave no recourse to our general credit and we\ndo not provide additional financial or other\nsupport other than during the period that we\nare contractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n10.8billion and $ 10.9billion as of June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively.\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities We hold variable\ninterests in entities (\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d)\nthat invest in community development entities\n(\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide debt financing to\nbusinesses and non-profit entities in low-\nincome and rural communities. Variable\ninterests in the CDEs held by the consolidated\nInvestor Entities are also our variable\ninterests. The activities of the Investor\nEntities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. The\nactivities of the CDEs are financed solely\nwith invested equity capital. We receive\nfederal and state tax credits for these\ninvestments. We consolidate the VIEs in which\nwe have the power to direct the activities\nthat most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s\neconomic performance and where we have the\nobligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.0billion and $ 1.9billion as\nof June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively, are reflected on our\nconsolidated balance sheets in cash, loans\nheld for investment, and other assets. The\nliabilities are reflected in other\nliabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no\nrecourse to our general credit. We have not\nprovided additional financial or other support\nother than during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it. Other We\nhold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We were not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance. Our maximum exposure to these\nVIEs is limited to the investments on our\nconsolidated balance sheets of $ 476million\nand $ 502million as of June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 , respectively. The\ncreditors of the other VIEs have no recourse\nto our general credit. We have not provided\nadditional financial or other support other\nthan during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it.\n                                              \n  105  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                         \n  NOTE\u00a06\u2014GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  \n                                         \nThe table below presents our goodwill,\nintangible assets and MSRs as of June 30, 2020\nand December 31, 2019 .

checking accounts, money market\ndeposits, negotiable order of withdrawals,\nsavings deposits and time deposits. We also\nuse a variety of other funding sources\nincluding short-term borrowings, senior and\nsubordinated notes, securitized debt\nobligations and other borrowings. In addition,\nwe utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by\ncertain portions of our loan and investment\nsecurities portfolios. Securitized debt\nobligations are presented separately on our\nconsolidated balance sheets, as they represent\nobligations of consolidated securitization\ntrusts, while federal funds purchased and\nsecurities loaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase, senior and subordinated notes and\nother borrowings, including FHLB advances, are\nincluded in other debt on our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nOur total short-term borrowings generally\nconsist of federal funds purchased and\nsecurities loaned or sold under agreements to\nrepurchase and short-term FHLB advances. Our\nlong-term debt consists of borrowings with an\noriginal contractual maturity of greater than\none year. The following tables summarize the\ncomponents of our deposits, short-term\nborrowings and long-term debt as of June 30,\n2020 and December 31, 2019 . The carrying\nvalue presented below for these borrowings\nincludes unamortized debt premiums and\ndiscounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair\nvalue hedge accounting adjustments.\nTable 7.1 : C omponents of Deposits, Short-   \nTerm Borrowings and Long-Term Debt            \n                                              \n  (Dollars                                    \n  in                                          \n  millions)             June        December  \n  Deposits:          30,2020         31,2019  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Non-inte\u2026    $      29,055    $     23,488  \n  deposits                                    \n  Interest\u2026          275,183         239,209  \n  deposits\u2026                                   \n  Total        $     304,238    $    262,697  \n  deposits                                    \n  Short-te\u2026                                   \n  borrowin\u2026                                   \n  Federal                                     \n  funds                                       \n  purchased                                   \n  and                                         \n  securiti\u2026                                   \n  loaned or    $         573    $        314  \n  sold                                        \n  under                                       \n  agreemen\u2026                                   \n  to                                          \n  repurcha\u2026                                   \n  FHLB                     0           7,000  \n  advances                                    \n  Total                                       \n  short-te\u2026    $         573    $      7,314  \n  borrowin\u2026                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                        \u2026  \n  \u2026          J\u2026  \u2026        \u2026                \u2026  \n  \u2026      M\u2026  3\u2026  \u2026        \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n  \u2026      D\u2026  2\u2026  \u2026        \u2026       V\u2026       \u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026              \u2026                            \n  \u2026      2\u2026      -

Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency derivatives to hedge, but we\nmay also use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We then enter\ninto derivative contracts with counterparties\nto economically hedge substantially all of our\nsubsequent exposures.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n                                              \n     Fair Value Hedges:We designate           \n     derivatives as fair value hedges when    \n     they are used to manage our exposure to  \n     changes in the fair value of certain     \n     financial assets and liabilities, which  \n     fluctuate in value as a result of        \n     movements in interest rates. Changes in  \n     the fair value of derivatives            \n  \u2022  designated as fair value hedges are      \n     presented in the same line item on our   \n     consolidated statements of income as     \n     the earnings effect of the hedged        \n     items. Our fair value hedges primarily   \n     consist of interest rate swaps that are  \n     intended to modify our exposure to       \n     interest rate risk on various            \n     fixed-rate financial assets and          \n     liabilities.                             \n                                              \n                                              \n     Cash Flow Hedges:We designate            \n     derivatives as cash flow hedges when     \n     they are used to manage our exposure to  \n     variability in cash flows related to     \n     forecasted transactions. Changes in the  \n     fair value of derivatives designated as  \n     cash flow hedges are recorded as a       \n     component of AOCI. Those amounts are     \n     reclassified into earnings in the same   \n     period during which the forecasted       \n     transactions impact earnings and         \n     presented in the same line item on our   \n  \u2022  consolidated statements of income as     \n     the earnings effect of the hedged        \n     items. Our cash flow hedges use          \n     interest rate swaps and floors that are  \n     intended to hedge the variability in     \n     interest receipts or interest payments   \n     on some of our variable-rate financial   \n     assets or liabilities. We also enter     \n     into foreign currency forward contracts  \n     to hedge our exposure to variability in  \n     cash flows related to intercompany       \n     borrowings denominated in foreign        \n     currencies.                              \n                                              \n                                              \n     Net Investment Hedges:We use net         \n     investment hedges to manage the foreign  \n     currency exposure related to our net     \n     investments in foreign operations that   \n     have functional currencies other than    \n     the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair     \n     value of net investment hedges are       \n  \u2022  recorded in the translation adjustment   \n     component of AOCI, offsetting the        \n     translation gain or loss from those      \n     foreign operations. We execute net       \n     investment hedges using foreign          \n     currency forward contracts to hedge the  \n     translation exposure of the net          \n     investment in our foreign operations     \n     under the forward method.                \n                                              \n                                              \n     Free-Standing Derivatives:Our            \n     free-standing derivatives primarily      \n     consist of our customer accommodation    \n     derivatives and other economic hedges.   \n     The customer accommodation derivatives   \n     and the related offsetting contracts     \n     are mainly interest rate, commodity and  \n     foreign currency contracts. The other    \n  \u2022  free-standing derivatives are primarily  \n     used to economically hedge the risk of   \n     changes in the fair value of our         \n     commercial mortgage loan origination     \n     and purchase commitments as well as      \n     other interests held. Changes in the     \n     fair value of free-standing derivatives  \n     are recorded in earnings as a component  \n     of other non-interest income.            \n                                              \n                                              \n  108  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk          \n                                              \nCounterparty Types                            \nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that arises from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d) and\nthe LCH Group (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs in our\ncentrally cleared contracts. In our uncleared\nbilateral contracts, we enter into agreements\ndirectly with our derivative counterparties.\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\n\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting arrangements, where possible, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. The amount of collateral\nexchanged is dependent upon the fair value of\nthe derivative instruments as well as the fair\nvalue of the pledged collateral. When valuing\ncollateral, an estimate of the variation in\nprice and liquidity over time is subtracted in\nthe form of a \u201chaircut\u201d to discount the value\nof the collateral pledged. Our exposure to\nderivative counterparty credit risk, at any\npoint in time, is equal to the amount reported\nas a derivative asset on our balance sheet.\nThe fair value of our derivatives is adjusted\non an aggregate basis to take into\nconsideration the effects of legally\nenforceable master netting agreements and any\nassociated cash collateral received or\npledged. See Table 8.3 for our net exposure\nassociated with derivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n                                              \n     CCPs: We clear eligible OTC derivatives  \n     with CCPs as part of our regulatory      \n     requirements. Futures commission         \n     merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the          \n     intermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs   \n     require that we post initial and         \n     variation margin through our FCMs to     \n     mitigate the risk of non-payment or      \n     default. Initial margin is required      \n     upfront by CCPs as collateral against    \n  \u2022  potential losses on our cleared          \n     derivative contracts and variation       \n     margin is exchanged on a daily basis to  \n     account for mark-to-market changes in    \n     those derivative contracts. For CME and  \n     LCH-cleared OTC derivatives, we          \n     characterize variation margin cash       \n     payments as settlements. Our FCM         \n     agreements governing these derivative    \n     transactions include provisions that     \n     may require us to post additional        \n     collateral under certain circumstances.  \n                                              \n                                              \n     Bilateral Counterparties: We enter into  \n     legally enforceable master netting       \n     agreements and collateral agreements,    \n     where possible, with bilateral           \n     derivative counterparties to mitigate    \n     the risk of default. We review our       \n     collateral positions on a daily basis    \n     and exchange collateral with our         \n     counterparties in accordance with these  \n     agreements. These bilateral agreements   \n     typically provide the right to offset    \n     exposure with the same counterparty and  \n     require the party in a net liability     \n     position to post collateral. Agreements  \n  \u2022  with certain bilateral counterparties    \n     require both parties to maintain         \n     collateral in the event the fair values  \n     of derivative instruments exceed         \n     established exposure thresholds.         \n     Certain of these bilateral agreements    \n     include provisions requiring that our    \n     debt maintain a credit rating of         \n     investment grade or above by each of     \n     the major credit rating agencies. In     \n     the event of a downgrade of our debt     \n     credit rating below investment grade,    \n     some of our counterparties would have    \n     the right to terminate their derivative  \n     contract and close out existing          \n     positions.                               \n                                              \nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\n\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty.

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period. We consider all available\ninformation, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs.\nFor additional information on the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities on a\nrecurring basis, see \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value\nMeasurement\u201d in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value \non a Recurring Basis                          \nThe following table displays our assets and\nliabilities measured on our consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of June 30, 2020 and December 31,\n2019 .\nTable 11.1 : Assets and Liabilities Measured  \nat Fair Value on a Recurring Basis            \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                       \u2026            \n         \u2026                       \u2026            \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026         \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0       \u2014       $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014            \n         0       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014            \n         \u2026       \u2026       0       \u2014            \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014            \n         0       \u2026       0       \u2014            \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    $  \u2026  )         \n         \u2026       0       \u2026       \u2014            \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  123  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                       \u2026            \n         \u2026                       \u2026            \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026          \u2026         \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0       \u2014       $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014            \n         0       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014            \n         \u2026       \u2026       0       \u2014            \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026       \u2014            \n         0       \u2026       0       \u2014            \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026    $  \u2026  )         \n         \u2026       0       \u2026       \u2014            \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026  )    $    \n                                              \n__________                                    \n                                              \n       Represents balance sheet netting of    \n       derivative assets and liabilities,     \n       and related payables and receivables   \n  (1)  for cash collateral held or placed     \n       with the same counterparty.

in unobservable inputs, may have a\nsignificant impact on fair value. Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity\nand credit spreads, in isolation, would result\nin a decrease in the fair value measurement.\nIn addition, an increase in default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by a decrease\nin recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and\nan increase in liquidity spreads.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasurements\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at\nthe consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments,\nare included in the Other category.\nBasis of Presentation                         \nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology        \nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess provides a funds credit for sources of\nfunds, such as deposits generated by our\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a funds charge for the use of\nfunds by each segment. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate third-party rates. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d in\nour 2019 Form 10-K.\nSegment Results and Reconciliation            \nWe may periodically change our business\nsegments or reclassify business segment\nresults based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies or changes\nin organizational alignment. The following\ntable presents our business segment results\nfor the three and six months ended June 30,\n2020 and 2019 , selected balance sheet data as\nof June 30, 2020 and 2019 , and a\nreconciliation of our total business segment\nresults to our reported consolidated income\nfrom continuing operations, loans held for\ninvestment and deposits.\n

Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as overdrafts and ATM\nusage. Service charges and other customer-\nrelated fees within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness are mostly related to fees earned on\ntreasury management and capital markets\nservices. Other contract revenue in our Credit\nCard business consists primarily of revenue\nfrom our partnership arrangements. Other\ncontract revenue in our Consumer Banking\nbusiness consists primarily of revenue earned\non certain marketing and promotional events\nfrom our auto dealers. Revenue from contracts\nwith customers is included in non-interest\nincome in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe following table presents revenue from\ncontracts with customers and a

unfunded lending commitments primarily\nconsist of credit card lines, loan commitments\nto customers of both our Commercial Banking\nand Consumer Banking businesses, as well as\nstandby and commercial letters of credit.\nThese commitments, other than credit card\nlines, are legally binding conditional\nagreements that have fixed expirations or\ntermination dates and specified interest rates\nand purposes. The contractual amount of these\ncommitments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to us should the counterparty draw\nupon the commitment. We generally manage the\npotential risk of unfunded lending commitments\nby limiting the total amount of arrangements,\nmonitoring the size and maturity structure of\nthese portfolios, and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of June 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 .

We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of the loans.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair\nvalue option on new loss sharing agreements.\nUnrealized gains and losses are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income. For those loss sharing\nagreements entered into as of December 31,\n2019, we amortize the liability recorded at\ninception into non-interest income as we are\nreleased from risk of payment under the loss\nsharing agreement and record our estimate of\nexpected credit losses each period in\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The\nliability recognized on our consolidated\nbalance sheets for these loss sharing\nagreements was $ 96million and $ 75million as\nof June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 ,\nrespectively.\nSee \u201c Note 4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and\nReserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments \u201d for\nmore information related to our c redit card\npartnership loss sharing arrangements.\n                                              \n  134  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents U.K. Payment Protection\nInsurance In the U.K., we previously sold\npayment protection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). In\nresponse to an elevated level of customer\ncomplaints across the industry, heightened\nmedia coverage and pressure from consumer\nadvocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority (\u201cFCA\u201d), formerly the Financial\nServices Authority, investigated and raised\nconcerns about the way the industry has\nhandled complaints related to the sale of\nthese insurance policies. For the past several\nyears, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Ombudsman Service\n(\u201cFOS\u201d) has been adjudicating customer\ncomplaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by\nconsumers who disagree with the rejection of\ntheir complaint by firms, leading to customer\nremediation payments by us and others within\nthe industry. In August 2017, the FCA issued\nfinal rules and guidance on the PPI\ncomplaints. This set the deadline for\ncomplaints as August 29, 2019. It also\nprovided clarity on how to handle PPI\ncomplaints under s.140A of the Consumer Credit\nAct, including guidance on how redress for\nsuch complaints should be calculated. In\ndetermining our best estimate of incurred\nlosses for future remediation payments,\nmanagement considers numerous factors,\nincluding (i) the number of customer\ncomplaints or information requests still to be\nprocessed; (ii) our expectation of upholding\nthose complaints; (iii) the expected number of\ncomplaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv)\nour expectation of the FOS upholding such\nescalated complaints; (v) the number of\ncomplaints that fall under s.140A of the\nConsumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated\nremediation payout to customers. We monitor\nthese factors each quarter and adjust our\nreserves to reflect the latest data. Our U.K.\nPPI reserve totaled $ 76million and $\n188million as of June 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 , respectively. For the six months\nended June 30, 2020 , no additions were made\nto the reserve. Our best estimate of\nreasonably possible future losses beyond our\nreserve as of June 30, 2020 is approximately $\n50million . Litigation In accordance with the\ncurrent accounting standards for loss\ncontingencies, we establish reserves for\nlitigation-related matters that arise from the\nordinary course of our business activities\nwhen it is probable that a loss associated\nwith a claim or proceeding has been incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably\nestimated. None of the amounts we currently\nhave recorded individually or in the aggregate\nare considered to be material to our financial\ncondition. Litigation claims and proceedings\nof all types are subject to many uncertain\nfactors that generally cannot be predicted\nwith assurance. Below we provide a description\nof potentially material legal proceedings and\nclaims. For some of the matters disclosed\nbelow, we are able to estimate reasonably\npossible losses above existing reserves, and\nfor other disclosed matters, such an estimate\nis not possible at this time. For those\nmatters below where an estimate is possible,\nmanagement currently estimates the reasonably\npossible future losses beyond our reserves as\nof June 30, 2020 are approximately $\n1.0billion . Our reserve and reasonably\npossible loss estimates involve considerable\njudgment and reflect that there is still\nsignificant uncertainty regarding numerous\nfactors that may impact the ultimate loss\nlevels. Notwithstanding our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlitigation matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and the range of reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed here. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in these matters,\nespecially those involving governmental\nagencies, and the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these matters, there\nis significant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these litigation\nmatters and an adverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be material to our\nresults of operations or cash flows for any\nparticular reporting period. Interchange In\n2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the\n                                              \n  135  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents trial court, and has been\nappealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. Visa and MasterCard have also\nsettled a number of the opt-out cases, which\nrequired non-material payments from issuing\nbanks, including Capital One. Visa created a\nlitigation escrow account following its\ninitial public offering of stock in 2008 that\nfunds settlements for its member banks, and\nany settlements related to MasterCard-\nallocated losses have either already been paid\nor are reflected in our reserves. Mortgage\nRepresentation and Warranty We face residual\nexposure related to subsidiaries that\noriginated residential mortgage loans and sold\nthese loans to various purchasers, including\npurchasers who created securitization trusts.\nIn connection with their sales of mortgage\nloans, these subsidiaries entered into\nagreements containing varying representations\nand warranties about, among other things, the\nownership of the loan, the validity of the\nlien securing the loan, the loan\u2019s compliance\nwith any applicable criteria established by\nthe purchaser, including underwriting\nguidelines and the existence of mortgage\ninsurance, and the loan\u2019s compliance with\napplicable federal, state and local laws. Each\nof these subsidiaries may be required to\nrepurchase mortgage loans or indemnify certain\npurchasers and others against losses they\nincur in the event of certain breaches of\nthese representations and warranties. The\nsubstantial majority of our representation and\nwarranty exposure has been resolved through\nlitigation, and our remaining representation\nand warranty exposure is almost entirely\nlitigation-related. Accordingly, we establish\nlitigation reserves for representation and\nwarranty losses that we consider to be both\nprobable and reasonably estimable. The reserve\nprocess relies heavily on estimates, which are\ninherently uncertain, and requires the\napplication of judgment. Our reserves and\nestimates of reasonably possible losses could\nbe impacted by claims which may be brought by\nsecuritization trustees and sponsors, bond-\ninsurers, investors, and GSEs, as well as\nclaims brought by governmental agencies. Anti-\nMoney Laundering In October 2018, we paid a\ncivil monetary penalty of $ 100million to\nresolve the monetary component of a July 2015\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(\u201cOCC\u201d) consent order relating to our anti-\nmoney laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) program. The OCC\nlifted the AML consent order in November 2019.\nThe Department of Justice and the New York\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office have closed their\ninvestigations into certain former check\ncasher clients of the Commercial Banking\nbusiness and our AML program. We are in\ndiscussions with the Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury to explore a potential\nregulatory resolution of its investigation\ninto our AML program, which could include a\nmonetary penalty. Cybersecurity Incident As a\nresult of the Cybersecurity Incident announced\non July 29, 2019, we are subject to numerous\nlegal proceedings and other inquiries and\ncould be the subject of additional proceedings\nand inquiries in the future. Consumer class\nactions . To date, we have been named as a\ndefendant in approximately 73 putative\nconsumer class action cases ( 61 in U.S.\nfederal courts and 12 in Canadian courts)\nalleging harm from the Cybersecurity Incident\nand seeking various remedies, including\nmonetary and injunctive relief. The lawsuits\nallege breach of contract, negligence,\nviolations of various privacy laws and a\nvariety of other legal causes of action. The\nU.S. consumer class actions have been\nconsolidated for pretrial proceedings before a\nmulti-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District\nof Virginia, Alexandria Division. Securities\nclass action . The Company and certain\nofficers have also been named as defendants in\na putative class action pending in the MDL\nalleging violations of certain federal\nsecurities laws in connection with statements\nand alleged omissions in securities filings\nrelating to our information security standards\nand practices. The complaint seeks\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief. Governmental inquiries\n. We have received inquiries and requests for\ninformation relating to the Cybersecurity\nIncident from Congress, federal banking\nregulators, relevant Canadian regulators, the\nDepartment of Justice, and the offices of\napproximately fourteen state Attorneys\nGeneral. We are cooperating with these offices\nand responding to their inquiries. In August\n2020, we entered into consent orders with the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors and the OCC\nresulting from regulatory reviews of the\nCybersecurity Incident and relating to ongoing\nenhancements of our cybersecurity and\noperational risk management\n                                              \n  136  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents processes. Capital One will\npay a $ 80million penalty to the U.S. Treasury\nas part of the OCC agreement, which has been\nfully accrued as of June 30, 2020. The Federal\nReserve Board agreement does not contain a\nmonetary penalty. Taxi Medallion Finance\nInvestigations Beginning in 2019, we have\nreceived subpoenas from the New York Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s office and from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York,\nCivil and Criminal Divisions, relating to\ninvestigations of the taxi medallion finance\nindustry we exited beginning in 2015. The\nsubpoenas seek, among other things,\ninformation regarding our lending\ncounterparties and practices. We are\ncooperating with these investigations. U.K.\nPPI Litigation Some of the claimants in the\nU.K. PPI regulatory claims process described\nabove have initiated legal proceedings. The\nsignificant increase in PPI regulatory claim\nvolumes shortly before the August 29, 2019\nclaims submission deadline increases the\npotential exposure for PPI-related litigation,\nwhich is not subject to the August 29, 2019\ndeadline. Other Pending and Threatened\nLitigation In addition, we are commonly\nsubject to various pending and threatened\nlegal actions relating to the conduct of our\nnormal business activities. In the opinion of\nmanagement, the ultimate aggregate liability,\nif any, arising out of all such other pending\nor threatened legal actions, is not expected\nto be material to our consolidated financial\nposition or our results of operations.\n                                              \n  137  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nItem 3.

Controls and\nProcedures Overview We are required under\napplicable laws and regulations to maintain\ncontrols and procedures, which include\ndisclosure controls and procedures as well as\ninternal control over financial reporting, as\nfurther described below. (a) Disclosure\nControls and Procedures Disclosure controls\nand procedures refer to controls and other\nprocedures designed to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be\ndisclosed in our financial reports is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified by the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d)\nrules and forms and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to\nallow timely decisions regarding our required\ndisclosure. In designing and evaluating our\ndisclosure controls and procedures, we\nrecognize that any controls and procedures, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives, and we must\napply judgment in evaluating and implementing\npossible controls and procedures. Evaluation\nof Disclosure Controls and Procedures As\nrequired by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), our\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted\nan evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as that\nterm is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30,\n2020 , the end of the period covered by this\nReport on Form 10-Q. Based upon that\nevaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of June 30, 2020 , at a\nreasonable level of assurance, in recording,\nprocessing, summarizing and reporting\ninformation required to be disclosed within\nthe time periods specified by the SEC rules\nand forms. (b) Changes in Internal Control\nOver Financial Reporting We regularly review\nour disclosure controls and procedures and\nmake changes intended to ensure the quality of\nour financial reporting. There were no changes\nin internal control over financial reporting\nthat occurred in the second quarter of 2020\nthat materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting.\n                                              \n  138  Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents PART II\u2014OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.
