Our expenses primarily\nconsist of the provision for credit losses,\noperating expenses, marketing expenses and\nincome taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\nresidual tax expense or benefit to arrive at\nthe consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments,\nare included in the Other category.\n                                              \n  4    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in the United\nKingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) and Canada.\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our commercial and industrial\ncustomers typically include companies with\nannual revenues between $20 million and $2\nbillion.\n                                              \n   Business Developments                      \n                                              \nWe regularly explore and evaluate\nopportunities to acquire financial services\nand products as well as financial assets,\nincluding credit card and other loan\nportfolios, and enter into strategic\npartnerships as part of our growth strategy.\nWe also explore opportunities to acquire\ntechnology companies and related assets to\nimprove our information technology\ninfrastructure and to deliver on our digital\nstrategy. We may issue equity or debt to fund\nour acquisitions. In addition, we regularly\nconsider the potential disposition or exit of\ncertain assets, branches, partnership\nagreements or lines of business.\n                                              \n  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)         \n  Pandemic                                    \n                                              \nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global\npublic-health crisis, disrupting economies and\nintroducing significant volatility into\nfinancial markets. We transformed how we work\nin order to protect the well-being of our\nassociates and our customers, and were able to\ncontinue to serve our customers, successfully\nmanage critical functions, and keep our lines\nof business operating.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant\nmajority of our associates across our\nworkforce transitioned to working remotely. In\nthe third quarter of 2022, we moved to a\nhybrid work methodology that allows for in-\noffice collaboration while still enabling\nassociates to work remotely. We continue to\nmonitor local conditions to ensure the safety\nof our associates.\n\nFor the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic\nimpacted our financial results, refer to \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 2.

level of return generated.\n                                              \n   Table 1:                                   \n                                              \n

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a segment, such as\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio, asset/liability management by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and\ncalculation of our residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments, are included in the\nOther category.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenue and expenses directly or\nindirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation process is\nunique to each business segment and acquired\nbusiness. We regularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nWe refer to the business segment results\nderived from our internal management\naccounting and reporting process as our\n\u201cmanaged\u201d presentation, which differs in some\ncases from our reported results prepared based\non generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). There is no\ncomprehensive authoritative body of guidance\nfor management accounting equivalent to U.S.\nGAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of\nour business segment results may not be\ncomparable to similar information provided by\nother financial services companies. In\naddition, our individual business segment\nresults should not be used as a substitute for\ncomparable results determined in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP.\n\nWe summarize our business segment results for\nthe third quarter and first nine months of\n2022 and 2021 and provide a comparative\ndiscussion of these results, as well as\nchanges in our financial condition and credit\nperformance metrics as of September 30, 2022\ncompared to December 31, 2021.

In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer and countercyclical\ncapital buffer requirements as described\nbelow. Our capital and leverage ratios are\ncalculated based on the Basel III Standardized\nApproach framework.\n\nAs a Category III institution, we have elected\nto exclude certain elements of accumulated\nother comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our\nregulatory capital as permitted under the\nBasel III Capital Rules.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe \u201cG-SIB Surcharge.\u201d We are not a G-SIB\nbased on the most recent available data and\nthus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  Stress Capital Buffer Rule                  \n                                              \nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s final rule to implement the\nstress capital buffer requirement (the \u201cStress\nCapital Buffer Rule\u201d), the Company\u2019s\n\u201cstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer\u201d includes its stress capital buffer\nrequirement (as described below), any G-SIB\nSurcharge (which is not applicable to us) and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%). Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC\nand Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the\n\u201cFDIC\u201d), hereafter collectively referred to as\nthe \u201cFederal Banking Agencies,\u201d set an earlier\neffective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be recalibrated every year\nbased on the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults. In particular, the Company\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement equals, subject to\na floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference\nbetween the Company\u2019s starting CET1 capital\nratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital\nratio under the severely adverse scenario of\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test\nplus (ii) the ratio of the Company\u2019s projected\nfour quarters of common stock dividends (for\nthe fourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the Company\u2019s\nprojected CET1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2021 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022 was\n2.5%.

Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 7.6%,\n9.1% and 11.1%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2022 through September 30,\n2023 .\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Banks. The capital conservation buffer\nfor the Banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, each Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%\nrespectively.\n\nIf the Company or any of the Banks fails to\nmaintain its capital ratios above the minimum\ncapital requirements plus the applicable\ncapital conservation buffer requirements, it\nwill face increasingly strict automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions and\ndiscretionary bonus payments to certain\nexecutive officers.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, respectively, each of the Company and\nthe Banks exceeded the minimum capital\nrequirements and the capital conservation\nbuffer requirements applicable to them, and\neach of the Company and the Banks were \u201cwell-\ncapitalized.\u201d The \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards\napplicable to the Company are established in\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s regulations, and the\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards applicable to the\nBanks are established in the OCC\u2019s PCA capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading book. The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more. As of September 30, 2022, the Company\nand CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule.\nSee \u201cMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d below for\nadditional information.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (the \u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that\nprovides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the current expected credit loss\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) standard on their regulatory capital\n(the \u201cCECL Transition Election\u201d). We adopted\nthe CECL standard (for accounting purposes) as\nof January 1, 2020, and made the CECL\nTransition Election (for regulatory capital\npurposes) in the first quarter of 2020.\nTherefore, the applicable amounts presented in\nthis Report reflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

Each\nline of business or first line function is\nresponsible for managing the risks associated\nwith their activities, including identifying,\nassessing, measuring, monitoring, controlling\nand reporting the risks within its business\nactivities, consistent with the risk\nframework. The \u201cSecond Line of Defense\u201d\nconsists of two types of functions:\nIndependent Risk Management (\u201cIRM\u201d) and\nSupport Functions. IRM oversees risk-taking\nactivities and assesses risks and issues\nindependent from the first line of defense.\nSupport Functions are centers of specialized\nexpertise (e.g., Human Resources, Accounting,\nLegal) that provide support services to the\nCompany. The \u201cThird Line of Defense\u201d is\ncomprised of the Internal Audit and Credit\nReview functions.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021.\n                                              \n  Table 21: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of           September         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     30, 2022         31, 2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             70  %            71  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or              30               29     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n                                              \n  40    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of           September         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     30, 2022         31, 2021     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             52  %            50  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660           20               20     \n  620 or              28               30     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

We\ncharge off loans as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses when we determine\nthe loan is uncollectible and record\nsubsequent recoveries of previously charged\noff amounts as increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Uncollectible finance charges\nand fees are reversed through revenue and\ncertain fraud losses are recorded in other\nnon-interest expense. Generally, costs to\nrecover charged off loans are recorded as\ncollection expenses as incurred and are\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense. Our charge-off policy for loans\nvaries based on the loan type.

The effective\ninterest rate on the loan immediately prior to\nthe loan modification is used as the effective\ninterest rate for purposes of measuring\nimpairment using the present value of expected\ncash flows. If the customer does not comply\nwith the modified payment terms, then the\ncredit card\n                                              \n  44    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nloan agreement may revert to its original\npayment terms, generally resulting in any loan\noutstanding being reflected in the appropriate\ndelinquency category and charged off in\naccordance with our standard charge-off\npolicy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our loans modified as TDRs receive an\nextension, an interest rate reduction,\nprincipal reduction, or a combination of these\nmodifications. In addition, TDRs also occur in\nconnection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\namortized cost.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of loans modified as TDRs receive an\nextension, with a portion of these loans\nreceiving an interest rate reduction or a\ngross balance reduction. The impairment on\nmodified commercial loans is generally\ndetermined based on the underlying collateral\nvalue.\n\nAs part of our response to the COVID-19\npandemic, we offered programs to accommodate\ncustomer hardship across our lines of business\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2020. Our\nCOVID-19 programs were designed to be short-\nterm accommodations so that we could provide\nour customers with prompt relief. Also in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional\nguidance was issued by the Federal Banking\nAgencies and contained in the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES\nAct\u201d) which provided banking organizations\nwith TDR relief for loan modifications to\ncertain qualifying borrowers impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile the majority of enrollments in our\nCOVID-19 programs were short-term and would\ngenerally not have resulted in TDR\nclassification under our existing policies,\nsome of these modification would have been\ndesignated as TDRs without the relief provided\nby the additional guidance issued by the\nFederal Banking Agencies and contained in the\nCARES Act. Therefore, the expiry of the\nguidance in the CARES Act on January 1, 2022,\nalong with our concurrent cessation in\napplying the additional guidance issued by the\nFederal Banking Agencies, drove an increase in\nreported TDRs for periods ending after\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nTable 27 presents our amortized cost of loans\nmodified in TDR as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, which excludes loan\nmodifications that do not meet the definition\nof a TDR.\n                                              \n  Table 27: Troubled Debt Restructurings      \n                                              \n                                              \n           Se\u2026                  D\u2026            \n           30,                  3\u2026            \n           20\u2026                  2\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (\u2026               %                    %     \n  in       Am\u2026    of            A\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              T\u2026                  To\u2026     \n                  M\u2026                  Mo\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026    $  404    1\u2026    %    $  3\u2026    23\u2026  %  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       149        6.4       1\u2026    10\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       553        23\u2026       5\u2026    34\u2026     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  b\u2026                                          \n  A\u2026       975    4\u2026            6\u2026    36\u2026     \n  R\u2026        12    0\u2026            13    0.8     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       987    4\u2026            6\u2026    37\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026       776    3\u2026            4\u2026    27\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026    $  2,\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    10\u2026  %  \n  S\u2026                                          \n  of                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  P\u2026    $  1,\u2026    7\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    78\u2026  %  \n  N\u2026       529    2\u2026            3\u2026    21\u2026     \n  T\u2026    $  2,\u2026    1\u2026    %    $  1\u2026    10\u2026  %  \n                                              \nWe provide additional information on modified\nloans accounted for as a TDR, including the\nperformance of those loans subsequent to\nmodification, in \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans.\u201d A recently\nissued accounting standard eliminates the\naccounting guidance for TDRs effective for\nfiscal years beginning on or after December\n15, 2022.

The NSFR Rule requires the\nCompany and each of the Banks to maintain an\namount of available stable funding, which is a\nweighted measure of a company\u2019s funding\nsources over a one-year time horizon,\ncalculated by applying standardized weightings\nto equity and liabilities based on their\nexpected stability, that is no less than a\nspecified percentage of its required stable\nfunding, which is calculated by applying\nstandardized weightings to assets, derivatives\nexposures and certain other items based on\ntheir liquidity characteristics. As a Category\nIII institution, the Company and the Banks are\neach required to maintain available stable\nfunding in an amount at least equal to 85% of\nits required stable funding. The NSFR Rule\nbecame effective on July 1, 2021 and applies\nto the Company and each of the Banks. The NSFR\nRule includes a semi-annual public disclosure\nrequirement, with the first disclosure due 45\ndays after the end of the second quarter of\n2023 . The Company and the Banks exceeded the\nNSFR Rule requirement as of September 30,\n2022.\n                                              \n  Borrowing Capacity                          \n                                              \nWe maintain a shelf registration with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) so\nthat we may periodically offer and sell an\nindeterminate aggregate amount of senior or\nsubordinated debt securities, preferred stock,\ndepositary shares, common stock, purchase\ncontracts, warrants and units. There is no\nlimit under this shelf registration to the\namount or number of such securities that we\nmay offer and sell, subject to market\nconditions. In addition, we also maintain a\nshelf registration associated with our credit\ncard securitization trust that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $30 billion\nof securitized debt obligations and a shelf\nregistration associated with our auto loan\nsecuritization trusts that allows us to\nperiodically offer and sell up to $25 billion\nof securitized debt obligations. The\nregistered amounts under these shelf\nregistration statements are subject to\ncontinuing review and change in the future,\nincluding as part of the routine renewal\nprocess.\n\nIn addition to our issuance capacity under the\nshelf registration statements, we also have\naccess to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve\nDiscount Window and the Fixed Income Clearing\nCorporation\u2019s general collateral financing\nrepurchase agreement service. The ability to\nborrow utilizing these sources is based on\nmembership status and the amount is dependent\nupon the Banks\u2019 ability to post collateral. As\nof September 30, 2022, we pledged both loans\nand securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum\nborrowing capacity of $18.5 billion, of which\n$7.6 billion was used.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we\nhad $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion,\nrespectively, in aggregate purchase obligation\nliabilities.\n\nAs of September 30, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, our total unfunded lending commitments\nwere $412.3 billion and $414.5 billion,\nrespectively, primarily consisting of credit\ncard lines, loan commitments to customers of\nboth our Commercial Banking and Consumer\nBanking businesses, as well as standby and\ncommercial letters of credit. We generally\nmanage the potential risk of unfunded lending\ncommitments by limiting the total amount of\narrangements, monitoring the size and maturity\nstructure of these portfolios and applying the\nsame credit standards for all of our credit\nactivities.

We are exposed to\nmarket risk primarily from the following\noperations and activities:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of deposit\ngathering and lending;\n\n\u2022 Asset/liability management activities\nincluding the management of investment\nsecurities, short-term and long-term\nborrowings and derivatives;\n\n\u2022 Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada\nwithin our Credit Card business; and\n\n\u2022 Customer accommodation activities within our\nCommercial Banking business.\n\nWe have enterprise-wide risk management\npolicies and limits, approved by our Board of\nDirectors, which govern our market risk\nmanagement activities. Our objective is to\nmanage our exposure to market risk in\naccordance with these policies and limits\nbased on prevailing market conditions and\nlong-term expectations. We provide additional\ninformation below about our primary sources of\nmarket risk, our market risk management\nstrategies and the measures that we use to\nevaluate these exposures.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Risk                          \n                                              \nInterest rate risk represents exposure to\nfinancial instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest rates. We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or re-pricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments which could\ninclude caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact on our projected 12-month\nbaseline net interest income resulting from\nmovements in interest rates. In addition to\nour existing assets and liabilities, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions, such as loan and deposit growth\nand pricing, and plans for projected changes\nin our funding mix in our baseline forecast.\nIn measuring the sensitivity of interest rate\nmovements on our projected net interest\nincome, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous\nparallel shift in the level of interest rates\ndetailed in Table 34 below. At the current\nlevel of interest rates, our net interest\nincome is expected to increase in higher rate\nscenarios and decrease in lower rate\nscenarios.

Our economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity measure is\ncalculated based on our existing assets and\nliabilities, including derivatives, and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes. Key\nassumptions used in the calculation include\nprojecting rate sensitive prepayments for\nmortgage securities, loans and other assets,\nterm structure modeling of interest rates,\ndiscount spreads, and deposit volume and\npricing assumptions. In measuring the\nsensitivity of interest rate movements on our\neconomic value of equity, we assume a\nhypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in\nthe level of interest rates detailed in Table\n34 below. Our current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity decreases in higher\ninterest rate scenarios and increases in lower\ninterest rate scenarios. Our current economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity to upward shocks\nin higher rate scenarios became more negative\nas compared to December 31, 2021, mainly due\nto the increase in long-term interest rates.\n\nTable 34 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand economic value of equity calculated under\nthe methodology described above as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In\ninstances where an interest rate scenario\nwould result in a rate less than 0%, we assume\na rate of 0% for that scenario. This\nassumption applies only to jurisdictions that\ndo not have negative policy rates. In\njurisdictions that have negative policy rates,\nwe do not floor interest rates at 0%. D ue to\nrecent increases in interest rates, we\nincorporated a scenario where interest rates\ndecrease by 200 basis points into our interest\nrate sensitivity analysis as of September 30,\n2022.\n                                              \n   Table 34: Interest Rate Sensitivity        \n   Analysis                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n              September        December       \n               30, 2022        31, 2021       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimat\u2026                                    \n  impact                                      \n  on                                          \n  project\u2026                                    \n  baseline                                    \n  net                                         \n  interest                                    \n  income:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis             0.3  %          3.4  %    \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis             1.0             2.5       \n  points                                      \n  +50                                         \n  basis             0.5             1.5       \n  points                                      \n  \u201350                                         \n  basis            -0.6            -1.8       \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis            -1.0                  N/A  \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis            -2.8                  N/A  \n  points                                      \n  Estimat\u2026                                    \n  impact                                      \n  on                                          \n  economic                                    \n  value of                                    \n  equity:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis            -5.8            -0.7       \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis            -1.6             1.9       \n  points                                      \n  +50                                         \n  basis            -0.7             1.4       \n  points                                      \n  \u201350                                         \n  basis             0.4            -2.6       \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis             0.6                  N/A  \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis             0.0                  N/A  \n  points                                      \n                                              \nIn addition to these industry standard\nmeasures, we also consider the potential\nimpact of alternative interest rate scenarios,\nsuch as stressed rate shocks as well as\nsteepening and flattening yield curve\nscenarios in our internal interest rate risk\nmanagement decisions.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments.

We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nnominal intercompany funding outstanding was\n742 million GBP and 520 million GBP as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively, and 1.7 billion CAD and 5.0\nbillion CAD as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively. Our nominal\nEUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were\n1.3 billion EUR and 1.2 billion EUR as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet to\ntranslation risk in AOCI and our capital\nratios. We manage our AOCI exposure by\nentering into foreign currency derivatives\ndesignated as net investment hedges. We\nmeasure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S.\ndollar appreciation shock, which we believe\napproximates a significant adverse shock over\na one-year time horizon, against the value of\nthe equity invested in our foreign operations\nnet of related net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 1.9 billion\nGBP and 1.8 billion GBP as of September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively and\n2.2 billion CAD and 1.9 billion CAD as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation\nDerivatives\nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency derivatives as an accommodation to\nour customers within our Commercial Banking\nbusiness. We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal.

The\ncontinuation of USD LIBOR as a representative\nrate into mid-2023 will allow many legacy USD\nLIBOR contracts to mature prior to cessation.\nFollowing IBA\u2019s announcement, the FCA formally\nannounced the future permanent cessation and\nloss of representativeness of LIBOR\nbenchmarks. The Federal Banking Agencies\nissued further guidance that banking\norganizations should cease using USD LIBOR as\na reference rate in new contracts as soon as\npracticable and in any event by December 31,\n2021. Consistent with the Federal Banking\nAgencies\u2019 guidance, we ceased entering into\nnew contracts referencing USD LIBOR as a\nreference rate as of January 1, 2022, subject\nto certain permissible exceptions.\n\nOur enterprise LIBOR transition program team,\nwhich has been working on this effort since\n2018 and includes senior management\nrepresentatives from across the enterprise,\nprovides monthly reporting to senior\nmanagement and quarterly reporting to our\nBoard of Directors. The information provided\nto senior management and the Board of\nDirectors includes exposure reporting, updates\non progress toward our goals to reduce our\nLIBOR exposure and relevant regulatory or\nindustry developments.\n\nOur LIBOR transition effort is focused on\nproactively transitioning exposures to an\nalternative rate or incorporating transition\nlanguage (\u201cfallback language\u201d) to provide a\ncontractual mechanism for transitioning upon\nthe LIBOR cessation. Our fallback language\naligns with the language recommended by the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d)\nin our existing lending contracts and the\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation (\u201cISDA\u201d) in our derivative\ncontracts and agreements to the greatest\nextent possible.\n\nWe continue to focus our LIBOR transition\nefforts on:\n\n\u2022 monitoring established controls to prevent\nthe origination of LIBOR indexed instruments\n\n\u2022 working with impacted customers and\ncounterparties to remediate remaining LIBOR\ncontracts\n\n\u2022 engaging with our clients, industry working\ngroups, and regulators\n\n\u2022 assessing the proposed rule issued by the\nFederal Reserve pursuant to the implementation\nof the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act\npassed by Congress earlier this year in which\nthe Federal Reserve recommends benchmark\nreplacement rates for covered derivative\ntransactions and cash transactions where a\npracticable interest rate fallback method has\nnot been established by June 30, 2023,\nincluding those in which a government-\nsponsored enterprise is a party.\n\nThe majority of LIBOR contracts that we have\ntransitioned to alternative rates have\nemployed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(\u201cSOFR\u201d). In the U.S., SOFR has been selected\nas the preferred alternative rate by the ARRC\nfor certain U.S. dollar derivative and cash\ninstruments. We have proactively worked with\ncustomers and prepared our systems, models,\nvaluation tools and processes to focus\noriginations on SOFR and other non-LIBOR rates\nand will continue to do so. While the majority\nof our non-LIBOR transactions have utilized\nSOFR, we have also employed credit sensitive\nalternative rates to LIBOR, to a limited\nextent, in response to customer demand.\n\nTo track transition status, instruments are\ncategorized based on whether they have\nfallback language (which may or may not adhere\nto the ISDA and ARRC standards) or have no\nfallback language. Instruments with no\nfallback language represent a higher risk for\nnot transitioning from LIBOR by June 30, 2023.\nThe majority of the instruments maturing after\nJune 30, 2023 are derivatives and commercial\nloans, which are summarized in the table\nbelow. Of these instruments, the majority\ncontain fallback language which adheres to the\nISDA and ARRC standards. The LIBOR Act\nprovides a means for phasing out contracts\nthat lack fallback language and which we are\nnot able to otherwise remediate prior to LIBOR\ncessation. We will continue to focus on\nreducing our LIBOR exposures through our\ntransition efforts, normal operations and\ncustomer interactions.\nTable 35: LIBOR Exposures on Derivatives and\nCommercial Loans\n                                              \n                                       Total  \n                                       LIBOR  \n                                       Comm\u2026  \n                           Total       Matu\u2026  \n                           LIBOR       after  \n              Sept\u2026       Commi\u2026        June  \n  (Dol\u2026         30,       Matur\u2026         30,  \n  in           2022        after        2023  \n  mill\u2026       Total         June       With\u2026  \n  Expo\u2026       LIBOR          30,       Fall\u2026  \n  Type\u2026       Comm\u2026         2023       Lang\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Deri\u2026    $  73,5\u2026    $  49,064    $  10,9\u2026  \n  Comm\u2026       49,5\u2026       42,328       1,458  \n  loans                                       \n  Total    $  123,\u2026    $  91,392    $  12,4\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  55    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                       Total  \n                                       LIBOR  \n                                       Comm\u2026  \n                           Total       Matu\u2026  \n                           LIBOR       after  \n              Dece\u2026       Commi\u2026        June  \n  (Dol\u2026         31,       Matur\u2026         30,  \n  in           2021        after        2023  \n  mill\u2026       Total         June       With\u2026  \n  Expo\u2026       LIBOR          30,       Fall\u2026  \n  Type\u2026       Comm\u2026         2023       Lang\u2026  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Deri\u2026    $  103,\u2026    $  64,605    $  14,5\u2026  \n  Comm\u2026       101,\u2026       71,874       2,047  \n  loans                                       \n  Total    $  205,\u2026    $  136,4\u2026    $  16,5\u2026  \n                                              \n_________\n\n(1) Commercial loan balances represent maximum\npotential exposures and derivatives represent\nnotional exposure.\n\nThese transition efforts have been implemented\nto remediate our remaining LIBOR contracts by\nJune 30, 2023.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses for commercial loans. Generally,\nloans that are designated as criticized\nperforming and criticized nonperforming are\nreviewed quarterly by management to determine\nif they are appropriately classified/rated and\nwhether any impairment exists. Noncriticized\nloans are also generally reviewed, at least\nannually, to determine the appropriate risk\nrating. In addition, we evaluate the risk\nrating during the renewal process of any loan\nor if a loan becomes past due.\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021. The internal risk\nrating status includes all past due loans,\nboth performing and nonperforming.\nTable 3.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by\nInternal Risk Ratings\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  83    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Criticized exposures correspond to the\n\u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d and\n\u201cDoubtful\u201d asset categories defined by bank\nregulatory authorities.\n\n(2) Includes PPP loans of $ 32million and $\n102million as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\n\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (one to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectability of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications, whether or not that\nmodification is classified as a troubled debt\nrestructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d), when estimating the\ncredit quality of our loan portfolio and\nestablishing allowance levels.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. Significant judgment is applied in\nour estimation of lifetime credit losses. When\ndeveloping an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d in our 2021 Form 10-K for further\ndiscussion of the methodology and policy for\ndetermining our allowance for credit losses\nfor each of our loan portfolio segments, as\nwell as information on our reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021.

The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions to net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses.

be variable\ninterest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which has provided a source of funding\nfor us and enabled us to transfer a certain\nportion of the economic risk of the loans or\nrelated debt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet the maximum amount of any remaining\nfunding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nWe separately present information for\nconsolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       20       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       10       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       30       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n                                              \n  91    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n         \u2026       27       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       26       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       53       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities of the VIE, which includes the\nseller\u2019s interest and repurchased notes held\nby other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.2billion of assets and $\n562million of liabilities as of September 30,\n2022, and $ 2.2billion of assets and $\n568million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2021.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to government-\nsponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service\nthe transferred loans pursuant to the\nguidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an\ninvestor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and\nABS in our investment securities portfolio,\nwhich represent variable interests in the\nrespective securitization trusts from which\nthose securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either invest in securities issued by\nthe VIE and were not involved in the design of\nthe VIE or no transfers have occurred between\nthe VIE and us.

Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritizations involve the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor certain investments in qualified\naffordable housing projects using the\nproportional amortization method if certain\ncriteria are met. The proportional\namortization method amortizes the cost of the\ninvestment over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021, we recognized\namortization of $ 484million and $ 477million,\nrespectively, and tax credits of $ 582million\nand $ 560million, respectively, associated\nwith these investments within income tax\nprovision. The carrying value of our equity\ninvestments in these qualified affordable\nhousing projects was $ 4.8billion and $\n4.7billion as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively. We are\nperiodically required to provide additional\nfinancial or other support during the period\nof the investments. Our liability for these\nunfunded\n                                              \n  93    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ncommitments was $ 1.7billion as of both\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and\nis largely expected to be paid from 2022 to\n2025.\n\nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n4.8billion as of both September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021. The creditors of the VIEs\nhave no recourse to our general credit and we\ndo not provide additional financial or other\nsupport other than during the period that we\nare contractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n12.5billion and $ 11.9billion as of September\n30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.3billion and $ 2.1billion as\nof September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively, are reflected on our\nconsolidated balance sheets in cash, loans\nheld for investment, and other assets. The\nliabilities are reflected in other\nliabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no\nrecourse to our general credit. We have not\nprovided additional financial or other support\nother than during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it.\n\nOther\n\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We are not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance. Our maximum exposure to these\nVIEs is limited to the investments on our\nconsolidated balance sheets of $ 341million\nand $ 383million as of September 30, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021, respectively. The creditors\nof the other VIEs have no recourse to our\ngeneral credit.

Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency swaps to hedge, but we may\nalso use a variety of other derivative\ninstruments, including caps, floors, options,\nfutures and forward contracts, to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risks. We\ndesignate these risk management derivatives as\neither qualifying accounting hedges or free-\nstanding derivatives. Qualifying accounting\nhedges are further designated as fair value\nhedges, cash flow hedges or net investment\nhedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic\nhedges that do not qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We then enter\ninto derivative contracts with counterparties\nto economically hedge substantially all of our\nsubsequent exposures.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. Our fair value hedges primarily consist\nof interest rate swaps that are intended to\nmodify our exposure to interest rate risk on\nvarious fixed-rate financial assets and\nliabilities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the forecasted transactions\nimpact earnings and presented in the same line\nitem in our consolidated statements of income\nas the earnings effect of the hedged items.\nOur cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps\nand floors that are intended to hedge the\nvariability in interest receipts or interest\npayments on some of our variable-rate\nfinancial assets or liabilities. We also enter\ninto foreign currency forward contracts to\nhedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  97    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that stems from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the\nIntercontinental Exchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH\nGroup (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs for our centrally\ncleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral\ncontracts, we enter into agreements directly\nwith our derivative counterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements, where applicable, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. We exchange collateral in\ntwo primary forms: variation margin, which\nmitigates the risk of changes in value due to\ndaily market movements and is exchanged daily,\nand initial margin, which mitigates the risk\nof potential future exposure of a derivative\nand is exchanged at the outset of a\ntransaction and adjusted daily. We exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin on our\ncleared derivatives. For uncleared bilateral\nderivatives, we exchange variation margin, and\nfrom September 2021 we exchange initial margin\non any new trades executed after September 1,\n2021, where such trades are in scope for\ninitial margin.\n\nThe amount of collateral exchanged for\nvariation margin is dependent upon the fair\nvalue of the derivative instruments as well as\nthe fair value of the pledged collateral and\nwill vary over time as market variables\nchange. The amount of the initial margin\nexchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation\nof initial margin exposure, as prescribed by\n1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators\u2019 margin\nrules for uncleared derivatives (\u201cPR Rules\u201d)\nor 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and\n2) the fair value of the pledged collateral;\nit will vary over time as market variables\nchange. When valuing collateral, an estimate\nof the variation in price and liquidity over\ntime is subtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d\nto discount the value of the collateral\npledged. Our exposure to derivative\ncounterparty credit risk, at any point in\ntime, is equal to the amount reported as a\nderivative asset on our balance sheet. The\nfair value of our derivatives is adjusted on\nan aggregate basis to take into consideration\nthe effects of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and any associated\ncollateral received or pledged. See Table 8.3\nfor our net exposure associated with\nderivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. We also clear exchange-traded\ninstruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures\ncommission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the\nintermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require\nthat we post initial and variation margin\nthrough our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-\npayment or default. Initial margin is required\nby CCPs as collateral against potential losses\non our exchange-traded and cleared derivative\ncontracts and variation margin is exchanged on\na daily basis to account for mark-to-market\nchanges in those derivative contracts. For\nCME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives,\nvariation margin cash payments are required to\nbe characterized as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with bilateral derivative\ncounterparties, where applicable, to mitigate\nthe risk of default. These bilateral\nagreements typically provide the right to\noffset exposure with the same counterparty and\nrequire the party in a net liability position\nto post collateral.

This amount will offset the cash\nflows associated with hedged forecasted\ntransactions. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted transactions were hedged was\napproximately 5.5years as of September 30,\n2022. The amount we expect to reclassify into\nearnings may change as a result of changes in\nmarket conditions and ongoing actions taken as\npart of our overall risk management strategy.\n

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n              observable in the market.       \n  Level\u00a03:    Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d)               \n              methodologies or similar        \n              techniques.                     \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nThe accounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period. We consider all available\ninformation, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs.\nFor additional information on the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities on a\nrecurring basis, see \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value\nMeasurement\u201d in our 2021 Form 10-K .\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following table displays our assets and\nliabilities measured on our consolidated\nbalance sheets at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of September 30, 2022 and December\n31, 2021.\nTable 11.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at\nFair Value on a Recurring Basis\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       2       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  112    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                      \u2026             \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026                    \n         1       2       3                    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  0    $  0      \u2014        $    \n         0       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       9      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2014             \n         0       \u2026       0      \u2014             \n                                              \n         \u2026       \u2026       \u2026      \u2026             \n         \u2026       6       \u2026      \u2014             \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n      $  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  \u2026      \u2026        $    \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Represents balance sheet netting of\nderivative assets and liabilities, and related\npayables and receivables for cash collateral\nheld or placed with the same counterparty.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity or\ncredit spreads, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. In\naddition, an increase in default rates would\ngenerally be accompanied by a decrease in\nrecovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an\nincrease in liquidity spreads, and would lead\nto a decrease in the fair value measurement.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasureme nts\n\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a segment, such as management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio,\nasset/liability management by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and residual tax\nexpense or benefit to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate that is not\nassessed to our primary business segments, are\nincluded in the Other category.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenue and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess provides a funds credit for sources of\nfunds, such as deposits generated by our\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a funds charge for the use of\nfunds by each segment. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate third-party rates. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments\nand Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d in\nour 2021 Form 10-K.\nSegment Results and Reconciliation\nWe may periodically change our business\nsegments or reclassify business segment\nresults based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies or changes\nin organizational alignment. The following\ntable presents our business segment results\nfor the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2022 and 2021, selected balance sheet data\nas of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and a\nreconciliation of our total business segment\nresults to our reported consolidated income\nfrom continuing operations, loans held for\ninvestment and deposits.\n

The contractual amount of these\ncommitments represents the maximum possible\ncredit risk to us should the counterparty draw\nupon the commitment. We generally manage the\npotential risk of unfunded lending commitments\nby limiting the total amount of arrangements,\nmonitoring the size and maturity structure of\nthese portfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of September 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021. The carrying value\nrepresents our reserve and deferred revenue on\nlegally binding commitments.\nTable 13.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments\n                                              \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n  \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  3\u2026          N\u2026          N\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Includes $ 4.2billion and $ 3.9billion of\nadvised lines of credit as of September 30,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n(2) These financial guarantees have expiration\ndates that range from 2022 to 2027 as of\nSeptember 30, 2022.\nLoss Sharing Agreements\nWithin our Commercial Banking business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans with the intent to sell them to the\nGSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of the loans.\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we elected the fair\nvalue option on new loss sharing agreements.\nUnrealized gains and losses are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income. For those loss sharing\nagreements entered into as of and prior to\nDecember 31, 2019, we amortize the liability\nrecorded at inception into non-interest income\nas we are released from risk of payment under\nthe loss sharing agreement and record our\nestimate of expected credit losses each period\nin provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The\nliability recognized on our consolidated\nbalance sheets for these loss sharing\nagreements was $ 85million and $ 90million as\nof September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\nrespectively. See \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments\u201d for more information related to\nour credit card partnership loss sharing\narrangements.\n                                              \n  123    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nLitigation\n\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for litigation-related matters that\narise from the ordinary course of our business\nactivities when it is probable that a loss\nassociated with a claim or proceeding has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 are approximately $\n200million. Our reserve and reasonably\npossible loss estimates involve considerable\njudgment and reflect that there is still\nsignificant uncertainty regarding numerous\nfactors that may impact the ultimate loss\nlevels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlitigation matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and the range of reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed here. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in these matters,\nespecially those involving governmental\nagencies, and the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these matters, there\nis significant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these litigation\nmatters and an adverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be material to our\nresults of operations or cash flows for any\nparticular reporting period.\nInterchange\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. Other merchants have asserted similar\nclaims in separate lawsuits, and while these\nseparate cases did not name any issuing banks,\nVisa, MasterCard and issuers, including\nCapital One, have entered settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement and have pursued their own claims.\nThe claims by the injunctive relief class have\nnot been resolved, but the settlement of $\n5.5billion for the monetary damages class\nreceived final approval from the trial court,\nand has been appealed to the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit. Visa and\nMasterCard have also settled a number of the\nopt-out cases, which required non-material\npayments from issuing banks, including Capital\nOne. Visa created a litigation escrow account\nfollowing its initial public offering of stock\nin 2008 that funds settlements for its member\nbanks, and any settlements related to\nMasterCard-allocated losses have either\nalready been paid or are reflected in our\nreserves.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201cCybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Incident, we\nare subject to numerous legal proceedings and\nother inquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We were named as a\ndefendant in approximately 75putative consumer\nclass action cases (primarily in U.S. courts\nwith cases also in Canadian courts) alleging\nharm from the Cybersecurity Incident and\nseeking various remedies, including monetary\nand injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege\nbreach of contract, negligence, violations of\nvarious privacy laws and a variety of other\nlegal causes of action. The U.S. consumer\nclass actions have been consolidated for\npretrial proceedings before a multi-district\nlitigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) panel in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia,\nAlexandria Division. In the third quarter of\n2020, the MDL court denied in part and granted\nin part Capital One\u2019s motion to dismiss and\npermitted pretrial discovery to continue. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2021, the parties agreed\nto a settlement of the U.S. consumer class\naction cases for an amount within existing\nreserves. The court approved the settlement in\nSeptember 2022. In Canada, a trial court in\nBritish Columbia preliminarily certified a\nclass of all impacted Canadian consumers\nexcept those in Quebec in the\n                                              \n  124    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nsecond quarter of 2022, which would allow the\ncase to proceed with discovery on a classwide\nbasis under Canadian law. The preliminary\ncertification decision has been appealed.\n\nSecurities class action . The Company and\ncertain officers have also been named as\ndefendants in a putative class action pending\nin the MDL alleging violations of certain\nfederal securities laws in connection with\nstatements and alleged omissions in securities\nfilings relating to our information security\nstandards and practices. The complaint seeks\ncertification of a class of all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired Capital One\nsecurities from July 23, 2015 to July 29,\n2019, as well as unspecified monetary damages,\ncosts and other relief. The court granted the\nCompany\u2019s motion to dismiss in September 2022.\n\nGovernmental inquiries . We have received\ninquiries and requests for information\nrelating to the Cybersecurity Incident from\nCongress, federal regulators, relevant\nCanadian regulators, the Department of\nJustice, and the offices of approximately\nfourteen state Attorneys General. We have\ncooperated with these offices and responded to\ntheir inquiries.\nIn August 2020, we entered into consent orders\nwith the Federal Reserve and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) resulting\nfrom regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity\nIncident and relating to ongoing enhancements\nof our cybersecurity and operational risk\nmanagement processes. We paid an $ 80million\npenalty to the U.S. Treasury as part of the\nOCC agreement. The Federal Reserve agreement\ndid not contain a monetary penalty. The OCC\nlifted its consent order on August 31, 2022.\n\nTaxi Medallion Finance Investigations\nBeginning in 2019, we have received subpoenas\nfrom the New York Attorney General\u2019s office\nand from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nSouthern District of New York, Civil and\nCriminal Divisions, relating to investigations\nof the taxi medallion finance industry we\nexited beginning in 2015. The subpoenas seek,\namong other things, information regarding our\nlending counterparties and practices. We have\ncooperated with these investigations.\nU.K. PPI Litigation\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority), we received\ncustomer complaints and regulatory claims\nrelating to PPI. COEP has materially resolved\nthe PPI complaints and regulatory claims\nreceived prior to the deadline. Some of the\nclaimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory claims\nprocess have subsequently initiated legal\nproceedings, seeking additional redress. We\nare responding to these proceedings as we\nreceive them.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n                                              \n  125    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.
