We believe \nour executive compensation program strongly   \nlinks rewards with both business and          \nindividual performance over multiple time     \nhorizons. We aim to align our executives\u2019     \ninterests with those of our stockholders while\nsupporting safety and soundness and           \nappropriately balancing risk. 2022 Company    \nPerformance Each year the Compensation        \nCommittee (\u201cCommittee\u201d) and the Independent   \nDirectors review and evaluate the Company\u2019s   \nqualitative and quantitative performance to   \nmake determinations regarding the compensation\nof our NEOs based on Capital One\u2019s pay-for-   \nperformancephilosophy. The Committee seeks to \ndirectly link the compensation of the NEOs    \nwith the Company\u2019s performance and the        \nexecutives\u2019 contributions to that performance \nover multiple time horizons. In 2022, Capital \nOne delivered very strong financial results   \nand made significant progress on our long-term\nstrategic initiatives. We made long-term      \ninvestments in transformation, talent,        \ntechnology and digital capabilities, and risk \nmanagement. Double-digit revenue growth, sound\nthrough-cycle underwriting, and strong credit \nperformance drove near-record profitability,  \nallowing the Company to invest for the future,\ndistribute significant capital to             \nstockholders, and maintain a strong balance   \nsheet. Each of our major lines of business    \ndelivered solid growth and returns. Our       \nDomestic Card business delivered very strong  \nrevenue growth, enabled by the increase in    \ncredit card loan balances and strong new      \naccounts and record purchase volume. We       \ncontinued to expand our national Consumer Bank\nfranchise with 5.5% deposit growth, and we    \nfully implemented our elimination of overdraft\nfees for our consumer banking customers,      \nsaving these customers hundreds of millions of\ndollars. Our Auto Finance and Commercial Bank \nbusinesses also delivered solid growth and    \nreturns while navigating an evolving          \ncompetitive and economic environment.         \nOperating expenses increased, driven by       \neconomic factors, growth, and our continued   \ninvestments in technology and talent. Our     \noperating efficiency ratio (1)(2)improved 79  \nbasis points to 44.2%, as revenue outpaced    \noperating expense growth. Adjusted operating  \nefficiency ratio (1)(3)improved slightly to   \n44.5%. We increased marketing investments by  \n$1.1 billion, or 40%, as we took advantage of \nopportunities to welcome new customers, deepen\nexisting relationships, and grow our consumer \nfranchises. As a result, our total efficiency \nratio (1)(2)increased 151 basis points to     \n56.0% and our adjusted total efficiency ratio \n(1)(3)increased to 56.3%. Diluted earnings per\nshare (\u201cEPS\u201d) was $17.91, driven by revenue   \ngrowth and strikingly strong credit. EPS was  \ndown from 2021 but the second-highest level in\nCapital One\u2019s history and well above pre-     \npandemiclevels of total and per share         \nprofitability. We distributed significant     \ncapital to stockholders, as we completed $4.8 \nbillion in common share repurchases and paid  \n$954 million in common dividends. After       \nsignificantly outperforming banks and the     \nbroader market in 2021, Capital One shares    \nended 2022 at $92.96, down 35.9% from year end\n2021 and below the KBW Bank Index which was   \ndown 23.7%. Valuations and stock price        \nperformance for the banking sector, and for   \nlarge consumer lenders specifically, came     \nunder pressure in 2022, primarily due to      \neconomic uncertainty and stock market         \nvolatility.                                   \n                                              \n       CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0        \n  4    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT          \n       CORPORATION                            \n                                              \nIn 2022, Capital One launched new products,   \nsigned new partners, and continued to         \nreimagine the customer experience. We earned a\nnumber of external awards and accolades       \nrelated to our products and customer          \nexperiences and continued to be recognized for\nour high levels of customer satisfaction and  \nadvocacy. Net Promoter Scores, which measure  \nhow likely our customers are to recommend     \nCapital One products and services, remained   \nextremely high across all of our major        \nbusinesses. We continued to harness the       \noperating, risk, and customer experience      \nbenefits of our migration to the public cloud,\nand are realizing cost benefits of our full   \nexit from data centers in 2020. We also       \nstrengthened our risk and control environment \nand continued to enhance cybersecurity        \ncapabilities. After sustained investment and  \nfocus across the Company, the Office of the   \nComptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) formally  \nclosed Capital One\u2019s cyber-related consent    \norder. In 2022, Capital One invested in       \nrecruiting, developing, and retaining talent. \nWe welcomed thousands of new associates and   \nhave maintained strong associate morale and   \nengagement. We continued to focus on our      \ndiversity and inclusion efforts, including    \nrecord diverse representation of new executive\nhires and promotees as well as continued      \nprogress in diverse representation among      \ncampus and professional hire pipelines. In    \nSeptember 2022, we welcomed associates back to\nour offices in our hybrid working model and   \nhave realized recruiting, retention and       \nproductivity benefits from offering associates\nflexibility in how they balance in-officeand  \nvirtual work. We also invested in the         \ncommunity through our Capital One Impact      \nInitiative, and combined philanthropic support\nwith skills-based associate volunteerism to   \nserve and support nonprofits across our       \nfootprint. We believe Capital One\u2019s portfolio \nof structurally-attractive businesses, coupled\nwith our long-term investments in talent,     \ntechnology, and digital capabilities,         \npositions us well to weather any potential    \neconomic stress while continuing to grow and  \ncreate long-term stockholder value. In 2022,  \nwe realized the benefits of these investments \nwhile continuing to position the Company for  \nlong-term competitiveness and success.

Our\nBoard is presenting the following twelve      \nnominees for election as directors at the 2023\nAnnual Stockholder Meeting. Each nominee is a \ncurrent Board member who was elected by       \nstockholders at the 2022 Annual Stockholder   \nMeeting. Each nominee has consented to serve a\none-yearterm. Information about the proposed  \nnominees for election as directors is set     \nforth under \u201cOur Director Nominees\u201d beginning \non page 14 of this proxy statement. In the    \nevent a nominee becomes unable to serve or for\ngood cause will not serve as a director, the  \nBoard may designate a substitute nominee or   \nreduce the size of the Board. If the Board    \ndesignates a substitute nominee, proxies will \nbe voted for the election of such substitute. \nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the   \nBoard has no reason to believe that any of the\nnominees will be unable or unwilling to serve \nas a director.

In its review, the Governance and \nNominating Committee considers whether the    \nBoard continues to possess the appropriate mix\nof skills and experience to oversee the       \nCompany in achieving these goals, and may seek\nadditional directors as a result of this      \nreview.

 \nOne Overview of Corporate Governance at       \nCapital One Capital One is dedicated to strong\nand effective corporate governance that       \nprovides the appropriate framework for the    \nBoard to engage with and oversee the Company. \nRobust and dynamic corporate governance       \npolicies and practices are the foundation of  \nan effective and well-functioning board, and  \nare vital to preserving the trust of our      \nstakeholders, including customers,            \nstockholders, regulators, suppliers,          \nassociates, our communities, and the general  \npublic. Information About Our Corporate       \nGovernance Policies and Guidelines The Board  \nhas adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to\nformalize its governance practices and provide\nits view of effective governance. Our         \nCorporate Governance Guidelines embody many of\nour long-standing practices, policies, and    \nprocedures, which collectively form a         \ncorporate governance framework that promotes  \nthe long-term interests of our stockholders,  \npromotes responsible decision-making and      \naccountability, and fosters a culture that    \nallows our Board and management to pursue     \nCapital One\u2019s strategic objectives. To        \nmaintain and enhance independent oversight,   \nour Board regularly reviews and refreshes its \ngovernance policies and practices as changes  \nin corporate strategy, the regulatory         \nenvironment and financial market conditions   \noccur, and in response to stakeholder feedback\nand engagement. The Board has also adopted    \nCapital One\u2019s Code of Conduct, which applies  \nto Capital One\u2019s directors, executives and    \nassociates, including Capital One\u2019s CEO, CFO, \nPrincipal Accounting Officer, and other       \npersons performing similar functions. The Code\nof Conduct reflects Capital One\u2019s commitment  \nto honesty, fair dealing, and integrity, and  \nguides the ethical actions and working        \nrelationships of Capital One\u2019s directors,     \nexecutives, and associates in their           \ninteractions with investors, current and      \npotential customers, fellow associates,       \ncompetitors, governmental entities, the media,\nand other third parties with whom Capital One \nhas contact.

The     \ndiverse backgrounds and experiences of our    \ndirectors provide the Board with broad        \nperspectives from which to determine the      \nleadership structure best suited for Capital  \nOne and the long-term interests of Capital    \nOne\u2019s stockholders and other stakeholders. We \nbelieve that our existing Board leadership    \nstructure of combined Chairman/CEO and Lead   \nIndependent Director provides the most        \neffective governance framework and allows our \nCompany to benefit from                       \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  24    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nMr. Fairbank\u2019s talent, knowledge, and         \nleadership as the founder of Capital One and  \nallows him to use the in-depthfocus and       \nperspective gained in running the Company to  \neffectively and efficiently lead our Board. As\nCEO, Mr. Fairbank oversees Capital One\u2019s day- \nto-dayoperations and strategic planning, and  \nas Chairman of the Board he leads the Board in\nits oversight role, including with respect to \nstrategic matters and risk management. The    \nCompany and the Board also benefit from an    \nactive and empowered Lead Independent Director\nwho provides strong, independent leadership   \nfor the Board. The Board at least annually    \nevaluates its leadership structure, including \nthe effectiveness of the combined Chairman/CEO\nand Lead Independent Director leadership      \nstructure, and currently believes that the    \nChairman and CEO roles should be held by the  \nsame person. Recognizing the importance of    \nindependent perspectives to the Board to      \nbalance the combined Chairman and CEO roles,  \nCapital One appropriately maintains strong    \nindependent and effective oversight of our    \nbusiness and affairs through our Lead         \nIndependent Director; fully-independent Board \ncommittees with independent chairs that       \noversee the Company\u2019s operations, risks,      \nperformance, and business strategy;           \nexperienced and committed directors; and      \nfrequent executive sessions. Our Independent  \nDirectors act as a strong counterbalance to   \nour combined roles of Chairman of the Board   \nand CEO. Lead Independent Director Our Board  \nbelieves that an active and empowered Lead    \nIndependent Director is key to providing      \nstrong, independent leadership for the Board. \nThe Lead Independent Director position,       \nelected annually by the other Independent     \nDirectors upon the recommendation of the      \nGovernance and Nominating Committee, is a     \ncritical aspect of our corporate governance   \nframework. Ms. Hackett, as Lead Independent   \nDirector, brings extensive experience leading \ncompanies that provide strategic organization \nand human resource consulting services to     \nboards of directors and senior management     \nteams. The Board believes that Ms. Hackett\u2019s  \nexperience enables her to provide valuable and\nindependent views to the boardroom, and ensure\nactive communication between management and   \nour Independent Directors to support their    \noversight responsibilities, including with    \nrespect to management of risks and            \nopportunities presented by the markets in     \nwhich Capital One competes.                   \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            25  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II -

The Governance and \nNominating Committee, under the direction of  \nits chair, who also serves as the Company\u2019s   \nLead Independent Director, assesses the       \ncomposition of, and criteria for, membership  \non the Board and its committees on an ongoing \nbasis. In fulfilling this responsibility, the \nGovernance and Nominating Committee has taken \na long-term view and continuously assesses the\nresiliency of the Board over the next ten to  \nfifteen years in alignment with the Company\u2019s \nstrategic direction to determine what actions \nmay be desirable to best position the Board   \nand the Company for success. In assessing     \nBoard resiliency, the Governance and          \nNominating Committee considers a variety of   \nfactors, including board skills, industry     \nexperience, diversity, board size, tenure,    \nevergreen recruiting, and staged refreshment. \nAs a result of these long-term strategic      \nresiliency assessments, the Governance and    \nNominating Committee has articulated a set of \nprinciples on board composition, including the\nfollowing:                                    \n                                              \n

Director Independence\nExcept for our CEO, who is the Company\u2019s      \nfounder, the Board has affirmatively          \ndetermined that the other members of our Board\nare independent under Capital One\u2019s Director  \nIndependence Standards (the \u201cIndependence     \nStandards\u201d), which have been adopted by the   \nBoard as part of Capital One\u2019s Corporate      \nGovernance Guidelines. The Independence       \nStandards reflect the director independence   \nrequirements set forth in the listing         \nstandards of the New York Stock Exchange      \n(\u201cNYSE\u201d) and other applicable legal and       \nregulatory rules, and also describe certain   \ncategorical relationships that the Board has  \ndetermined to be immaterial for purposes of   \ndetermining director independence. The        \ncategorical relationships that the Board has  \ndeemed immaterial for purposes of determining \ndirector independence are: (i) relationships  \nbetween Capital One and an entity where the   \ndirector serves solely as a non-              \nmanagementdirector; (ii) transactions between \nCapital One and a director or a director\u2019s    \nimmediate family member (or their primary     \nbusiness affiliations) that fall below the    \nnumerical thresholds in the NYSE listing      \nstandards (or do not otherwise preclude       \nindependence under those standards), and that \nare ordinary course, on arm\u2019s-lengthmarket    \nterms, and, in the case of extensions of      \ncredit, followed usual underwriting           \nprocedures, present no more than the normal   \ncollectability risk or other unfavorable      \nfeatures and are in compliance with applicable\nlegal and regulatory requirements; and (iii)  \ndiscretionary contributions made by Capital   \nOne to not-for-profitorganizations,           \nfoundations, or universities in which a       \ndirector (or immediate family member) serves  \nas an executive officer that in any single    \nfiscal year within the last three years do not\nexceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of that\nentity\u2019s consolidated gross revenues. In      \nmaking its independence recommendations, the  \nGovernance and Nominating Committee and the   \nBoard evaluate information obtained from non- \nmanagementdirectors\u2019 responses to a           \nquestionnaire inquiring about their           \nrelationships with Capital One, and those of  \ntheir immediate family members and primary    \nbusiness or charitable affiliations and other \npotential conflicts of interest, as well as   \ncertain information related to transactions,  \nrelationships, or arrangements between Capital\nOne and a non-managementdirector or their     \nimmediate family members, primary business, or\ncharitable affiliations. Following this       \nreview, the Board determined that each of the \ndirector nominees (excluding our CEO) is      \nindependent under the Independence Standards. \nThe Board also determined that Ms. Catherine  \nWest was independent during the period in 2022\nwhen she served on the Board.

As part of this        \nonboarding program, over a period of          \napproximately 18 months, new directors meet   \nwith members of senior management serving in  \nvarious roles and functions, as well as Board \ncommittee chairs, the Lead Independent        \nDirector, and individual directors, to review \nand discuss information about the Company, the\nbusiness, the boardroom, and individual       \ndirector roles and responsibilities.          \nAdditionally, new directors are assigned an   \nexperienced director to serve as a mentor to  \nfacilitate their onboarding to the Board and  \nthe Company. As we continue to enhance our    \ndirector onboarding experience, the Company   \ndeveloped and implemented the committee       \nonboarding program, which is designed to      \nfacilitate and accelerate directors\u2019          \nintegration and contribution to the committees\non which they serve. Our continuing director  \neducation program is designed to provide: (i) \nregular updates on external opportunities for \ncontinuing education offered by applicable    \nregulators, professional organizations, and   \nacademic institutions; (ii) internal director \neducation programs; (iii) various board-      \nrelated publications; and (iv) access to      \nvarious peer-to-peernetworks. Our directors   \nare also encouraged to pursue other           \neducational opportunities, at the Company\u2019s   \nexpense, to enhance directors\u2019 ability to     \nperform their duties. Executive Sessions Our  \nIndependent Directors regularly convene       \nexecutive sessions led by the Lead Independent\nDirector at Board and committee meetings as   \nneeded. The executive sessions allow the      \nIndependent Directors to discuss strategy, CEO\nand senior management performance and         \ncompensation, succession planning, Board      \neffectiveness, and other matters without      \nmanagement present. In 2022, the Independent  \nDirectors of the Board met in executive       \nsession without members of management present \nand the Independent Directors of each         \ncommittee also met in executive session       \nwithout members of management present. During \nthese executive sessions, Directors have      \naccess to all the members of senior management\nupon request, such as the CEO, CFO, General   \nCounsel and Corporate Secretary, Chief Risk   \nOfficer, Chief Audit Officer, Chief           \nInformation Security Officer, Chief Technology\nRisk Officer, Chief Credit Review Officer, and\nChief Compliance Officer. The Lead Independent\nDirector and/or any director may request      \nadditional executive sessions of the          \nIndependent Directors.

In  \nassessing their performance, the Board and its\ncommittees take a multi-year perspective to   \nidentify and evaluate trends and assure       \nthemselves that areas identified for          \nimprovement are addressed appropriately and in\na timely manner. To ensure the process stays  \nfresh and continues to generate rich insights,\nthe Board follows a cyclical, programmatic    \napproach when conducting Board and committee  \nevaluations. This approach includes regular,  \nholistic reviews of the evaluation framework, \nmethodology, and form. While the Board and    \neach of its committees conducts a formal      \nevaluation annually, the Board considers its  \nperformance and that of its committees        \ncontinuously throughout the year and shares   \nfeedback with management. Each year, the Board\nand its committees may conduct their annual   \nevaluations through one or a combination of   \nevaluative approaches, including written      \nsurveys, individual director interviews, group\ndiscussions in executive session, and/or      \nengagement of a third-party facilitator. As   \npart of the Board\u2019s self-evaluation process,  \ndirectors consider various topics related to  \nBoard composition, effectiveness, structure,  \nand performance and the overall mix of        \ndirector skills, experience, and background.  \nSpecifically, topics considered during the    \n2022 annual Board and committee self-         \nevaluations process included:                 \n                                              \n  \u220e    Board engagement, culture, and         \n       setting the \u201ctone at the top\u201d          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Board leadership, including the roles  \n  \u220e    of the Lead Independent Director and   \n       Chairman of the Board                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Oversight of and engagement in         \n  \u220e    corporate strategy (both short- and    \n       long-term strategic objectives) and    \n       Company performance                    \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Oversight of the CEO, executive        \n       compensation, and evaluation           \n                                              \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            31  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    CEO and executive talent development   \n       and succession planning                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Access to Company executives and       \n       associates                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       Board and committee composition,       \n  \u220e    including director skills,             \n       background, diversity, and new         \n       director recruiting activities         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Oversight of enterprise and            \n       technology risk, including the         \n       stature of the risk management         \n  \u220e    function and appropriateness of the    \n       Company\u2019s risk appetites and risk      \n       management in light of the scale and   \n       complexity of the Company\u2019s business   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Overall Board governance including     \n       quality and quantity of materials and  \n  \u220e    information, conduct of meetings, and  \n       support for those activities from      \n       management                             \n                                              \nAnnual Assessment of Individual Director      \nNominees Each year the Chair of the Governance\nand Nominating Committee conducts an          \nindividual director assessment process.

Annual Performance Assessment of the CEO\nLed by the Lead Independent Director, the     \nIndependent Directors annually assess the     \nperformance of Mr. Fairbank as Capital One\u2019s  \nCEO through a process developed and overseen  \nby the Governance and Nominating Committee.   \nThis process includes an in-depthdiscussion of\nthe CEO\u2019s performance by the Independent      \nDirectors in executive session during which   \ndirectors consider a variety of factors. The  \nareas assessed relate to overall CEO          \nperformance, leadership, financial and        \noperating performance, governance and risk    \nmanagement, strategic performance, and        \ncustomer and associate satisfaction. The      \nIndependent Directors also consider feedback  \nfrom the Board and self-assessment materials  \nprovided by Mr. Fairbank regarding his and the\nCompany\u2019s performance and achievements during \nthe performance year. For additional          \ninformation, see \u201cChief Executive Officer     \nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 91. The annual\nCEO performance assessment is completed as    \npart of Capital One\u2019s year-endcompensation    \nprocess. The Compensation Committee manages   \nyear-endcompensation decisions within the     \ncontext of such assessment and recommends     \ncompensation for the CEO based on such        \nassessment to the full Board. The Lead        \nIndependent Director and Chair of the         \nCompensation Committee jointly share the      \nfeedback from the CEO performance assessment  \nwith Mr. Fairbank in a closed session.

Each year, the Board participates in an \nannual Board strategy meeting at which the    \nBoard reviews and discusses the Company\u2019s     \nlong-term strategy with the CEO and key senior\nleaders. The Board provides effective         \nchallenge, feedback, and input on the         \nCompany\u2019s strategy, strategic priorities, and \ninvestments. Following the Board strategy     \nmeeting, the Chief Risk Officer meets with the\nBoard to provide a risk assessment of Capital \nOne\u2019s strategic initiatives. After review, the\nBoard approves the Company\u2019s strategic plan.  \nFurthermore, the Risk Department regularly    \nprovides the Risk Committee, among other      \nthings, with a report of the Company\u2019s        \nperformance against its risk appetite metrics,\nassessments of the external environment and   \nthe Company\u2019s positioning in context of key   \nrisk categories The Board regularly reviews   \nthe financial, competitive, and risk          \nperformance of the Company and updates on key \nstrategic objectives.

Risk Oversight  \nEffective risk management and control         \nprocesses are critical to our safety and      \nsoundness, our ability to predict and manage  \nthe challenges that Capital One and the       \nfinancial services industry face and,         \nultimately, our long-term corporate success.  \nThe enterprise-wide risk management framework \ndefines the Board\u2019s appetite for risk taking  \nand enables senior management to understand,  \nmanage and report on risk. The risk management\nframework is implemented enterprise-wide and  \nincludes seven risk categories: compliance,   \ncredit, liquidity, market, operational,       \nreputation and strategic. The Board\u2019s role in \nrisk oversight of Capital One is consistent   \nwith its leadership structure, with the CEO   \nand other members of senior management having \nresponsibility for assessing and managing     \nCapital One\u2019s risk exposure on a day-to-      \ndaybasis, and the Board and its committees    \nproviding oversight in connection with these  \nefforts. The Board\u2019s oversight focuses on our \nmaterial risks and any notable emerging themes\nto ensure that Capital One\u2019s risk management  \nis adequate. The Chair of the Risk Committee, \nin collaboration with the Lead Independent    \nDirector, helps ensure that the Board has     \nappropriate discussions on risk topics. The   \nRisk Committee is responsible for reviewing   \nand recommending to the Board for approval    \ncertain risk appetites taking into account the\nCompany\u2019s structure, risk profile, complexity,\nactivities, size, and other appropriate risk- \nrelated factors. The Risk Committee considers \nboth current risk, including timeframes       \nreflected by those risks, as well as emerging \nrisks and future threats. At the management   \nlevel, senior management committees serve as  \ngovernance forums for the CEO, Chief Risk     \nOfficer, and other management executives to   \nreceive and discuss risk management           \ninformation, reports, views, and escalated    \nmatters from lines of business, the Risk      \nDepartment, the Audit Department and other    \nareas of the Company. Enterprise-wide risk    \nmanagement is generally the responsibility of \nthe Chief Risk Officer, who has accountability\nfor proposing risk appetite and reporting     \nlevels related to all seven risk categories.  \nThe Chief Risk Officer is also responsible for\nensuring that the Company has an overall      \nenterprise risk framework and that it         \nroutinely assesses and reports on enterprise  \nlevel risks. The Chief Risk Officer reports   \nboth to the CEO and to the Risk Committee, and\nupdates the Risk Committee regularly on the   \nCompany\u2019s performance on risk appetite metrics\nin addition to ad hoc reports on emerging     \nrisks. The Board meets with outside advisors  \nperiodically, as appropriate and necessary,   \nand is empowered to consult at any time with  \noutside advisors related to future threats and\ntrends. The Audit Committee also plays an     \nimportant risk oversight function, and        \noversees elements of compliance, including    \nfinancial reporting that encompasses          \ndisclosure controls and procedures. The       \nCompensation Committee oversees compensation  \npolicies and practices                        \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            35  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nto ensure balanced risk-taking in our         \ncompensation programs, practices and decisions\nas further described in \u201cRisk Assessment of   \nCompensation Policies and Practices\u201d on page  \n37 below. Finally, the Board as a whole       \noversees the entire enterprise-wide risk      \nframework for the Company, including the      \noversight of strategic risk. Cybersecurity and\nTechnology Risk As a financial services       \ncompany entrusted with the safeguarding of    \nsensitive information, our Board believes that\na strong enterprise cyber program is vital to \neffective risk management. As part of its     \nprogram of regular oversight, the Risk        \nCommittee of the Board is responsible for     \noverseeing cyber risk, information security,  \nand technology risk, including management\u2019s   \nactions to identify, assess, mitigate, and    \nremediate material cyber issues and risks. The\nRisk Committee receives at least quarterly    \nreports from the Chief Information Security   \nOfficer and Chief Technology Risk Officer on  \nthe Company\u2019s technology and cyber risk       \nprofile, enterprise cyber program, and key    \nenterprise cyber initiatives. In addition, the\nRisk Committee discusses matters escalated to \nit by the Technology and Cyber Risk Committee,\na management-level committee dedicated to the \ndiscussion of enterprise-wide cybersecurity   \nand technology risk issues whose              \nresponsibilities include, among other things, \ndiscussion of cyber and technology risks. The \nRisk Committee coordinates with the full Board\nregarding the strategic implications of cyber \nand technology risks. The Chief Information   \nOfficer, Chief Information Security Officer,  \nand Chief Technology Risk Officer also follow \na risk-based escalation process to notify the \nRisk Committee outside of the quarterly       \nreporting cycle when they identify an emerging\nrisk or material issue. The Risk Committee    \nannually reviews and recommends the Company\u2019s \ninformation security policy and information   \nsecurity program to the Board for approval. At\nleast annually, the Board reviews and         \ndiscusses the Company\u2019s technology strategy   \nwith the Chief Information Officer; reviews   \nand discusses the Company\u2019s cybersecurity     \nstrategy with the Chief Information Security  \nOfficer and Chief Technology Risk Officer; and\napproves the Company\u2019s technology strategic   \nplan. In addition, the Risk Committee         \nparticipates in periodic cyber education      \nsessions. Succession Planning Pursuant to our \nCorporate Governance Guidelines, the Board is \nresponsible for maintaining a succession plan \nfor the CEO and certain key executive roles. A\nplanning process has been developed and       \nmaintained to identify, develop, and assess   \nsuccessors to the CEO and certain key         \nexecutives. The Board reviews and updates     \nthese succession plans at least annually. Our \nBoard believes that the directors and the CEO \nshould work together on executive succession  \nplanning and that the entire Board should be  \ninvolved. Each year, as part of Capital One\u2019s \nsuccession planning process, our CEO provides \nthe Board with recommendations on, and        \nevaluations of, potential CEO successors. The \nBoard considers a number of factors such as   \nexperience, skills, competencies, diversity,  \nand potential in its review of the senior     \nexecutive team to assess which executives     \npossess or can develop the attributes that the\nBoard believes are necessary to lead and      \nachieve the Company\u2019s goals. Among other steps\ntaken to promote this process throughout the  \nyear, executives one and two levels below the \nCEO often attend Board meetings and present to\nthe Board, providing the Board with numerous  \nopportunities to interact with our senior     \nmanagement and assess their leadership        \ncapabilities. Additionally, each line of      \nbusiness and the Risk, Audit, and Finance     \nfunctions engage in succession planning for   \nkey roles at least once per year. The Chief   \nHuman Resources Officer reviews these line of \nbusiness succession plans. Our Board          \nproactively reviewed plans for temporary      \nemergency successors across key roles in late \n2022. The temporary emergency succession plan \nis intended to identify the leaders who can   \nassume the responsibilities in the immediate  \nshort-term to ensure business continuity, day-\nto-daymanagement of the team and business for \nour senior management and key roles. Our Board\nalso has established steps to address         \nemergency CEO succession planning for an      \nunplanned CEO succession event. Our emergency \nCEO succession planning is intended to enable \nour Company to respond to an unexpected CEO   \ntransition by continuing our Company\u2019s safe   \nand sound operation and minimizing potential  \ndisruption or loss of continuity to our       \nCompany\u2019s operations and strategy. The Board  \nreviews annually the CEO\u2019s emergency successor\nrecommendations. As a result of this evergreen\nprocess, there is a named CEO emergency       \nsuccessor should the CEO become unexpectedly  \nunable to serve.                              \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  36    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nRisk Assessment of Compensation Policies and  \nPractices The Compensation Committee oversees \nall of our compensation policies and          \npractices, including our incentive            \ncompensation policies and practices, with a   \nview toward ensuring that such policies and   \npractices encourage balanced risk-taking, are \ncompatible with effective controls and risk   \nmanagement, align with our business strategy, \nand enable the Company to attract and retain  \ntop talent, especially in key job functions.  \nEvery two years, the Compensation Committee   \nreviews and approves the Incentive            \nCompensation Governance Policy, which applies \nto all Company associates and governs         \nincentive compensation decisions. The         \nIncentive Compensation Governance Policy      \nprovides the framework for oversight of the   \ndesign of incentive compensation programs. In \nsetting executive compensation, the           \nCompensation Committee assesses each of the   \nNEOs against one or more performance          \nobjectives specifically designed to evaluate  \nthe degree to which the NEOs balanced risks   \ninherent in their specific roles. The         \nCompensation Committee also implements        \nadditional risk-balancing features for certain\nequity awards, as described in more detail in \nthe \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d    \nbeginning on page 78. In addition, the        \nCompensation Committee reviews the Company\u2019s  \nNEO and other senior executive compensation   \nprograms as well as any other material        \nincentive compensation programs, plans or     \nagreements. During these reviews, the         \nCompensation Committee discusses the Company\u2019s\nmost significant risks, including the         \nCompany\u2019s status with respect to managing     \nthose risks and the relationship of those     \nrisks to compensation programs. The review    \nincludes discussion and analysis of risk-     \nbalancing features embedded in these incentive\ncompensation programs and other actions taken \nby the Company to appropriately balance risk  \nand achieve conformance with regulatory       \nguidance. The Compensation Committee also     \ndiscusses these programs with the Company\u2019s   \nChief Risk Officer, Chief Human Resources     \nOfficer, and the Compensation Committee\u2019s     \nindependent compensation consultant, as       \nappropriate. Based on these discussions, the  \nCompensation Committee believes our           \ncompensation programs are consistent with     \nsafety and soundness, operate in a manner that\nappropriately balances risk, and are not      \nreasonably likely to have a material adverse  \neffect on the Company. The Compensation       \nCommittee\u2019s active oversight, together with   \nthe Company\u2019s interactions and discussions    \nwith its regulators, has further enhanced the \nCompany\u2019s risk management and control         \nprocesses with respect to incentive           \ncompensation at the Company and supported our \ncontinued compliance with the interagency     \nguidance on sound incentive compensation      \npractices. Stockholder Engagement We value the\ninput and insights of our stockholders and are\ncommitted to continued meaningful engagement  \nwith investors. As a result, we engage in     \ncontinuous outreach throughout the year to    \ndiscuss with our stockholders the issues that \nare important to them, listen to their        \nexpectations for us, and share our views.     \nDuring our discussions, we also seek to       \nprovide visibility and transparency into our  \nbusiness, our performance, and our governance \nand compensation practices. We report         \nstockholder feedback to our Board to help them\nrespond to stockholders\u2019 concerns and         \nfeedback.

The      \nGovernance and Nominating Committee has pre-  \napprovedthe following types of Related Person \nTransactions as being not inconsistent with   \nthe best interests of Capital One and its     \nstockholders: director and executive          \ncompensation otherwise disclosed in the       \nCompany\u2019s proxy statement and/or approved by  \nthe Compensation Committee or the Board;      \ntransactions in amounts that are not material \nand where the relationship arises only from a \nRelated Person\u2019s position as an employee      \n(other than as an executive officer) or a     \ndirector of, or having immaterial financial   \nholdings in, another entity; and financial    \nservices, including loans, extensions of      \ncredit, or other financial services and       \nproducts provided by Capital One to a Related \nPerson that are in the ordinary course, non-  \npreferential,do not involve features          \nunfavorable to the Company, and comply with   \nall applicable laws, rules, and regulations   \n(including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002     \n(\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and Regulation O of the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation     \nGuidelines).

Our approach to ESG \nmatters is constantly evolving to adapt to    \nemerging issues in our industry and society.  \nLast year, we published our inaugural ESG     \nReport, which included a list of 14 focus     \nareas that guide the development of our ESG   \npolicies and practices. Highlights of our ESG \nefforts are summarized below. Oversight of    \nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance Matters \nOur ESG approach is integrated into our       \nexisting governance structure at the Board and\nmanagement levels of the Company. Our Board is\nactively engaged with management on ESG-      \nrelatedissues. In 2022, our Board committees  \nrefreshed their committee charters to         \nformalize their ESG roles and                 \nresponsibilities. The Governance and          \nNominating Committee has overall              \nresponsibility for overseeing policies,       \nprograms and strategies related to ESG matters\nand coordinates such oversight with other     \nBoard committees and/or the full Board, as    \nappropriate. The Governance and Nominating    \nCommittee also engages with management on ESG \nmatters at least annually. The Governance and \nNominating Committee receives updates on      \ninvestor sentiment, reviews and provides      \nfeedback on the Company\u2019s ESG Report, and     \nengages on other ESG initiatives.

In 2022, we      \nadvanced our work to improve the              \nsustainability of our internal operations,    \nunderstand the financed emissions of our      \ncustomers, educate consumers, identify and    \nmanage climate risks, and work with businesses\nto develop and finance sustainable solutions. \nOur Strategy and Goals Capital One is         \ncommitted to the following goals:             \n                                              \n  Reduce                                      \n  Scope 1                                     \n  Direct         Purchase                     \n  Emissions      100\u00a0percent                  \n  by 50          renewable      Reduce water  \n  percent and    electricity    use at our    \n  reduce         while          facilities    \n  Scope 3        increasing     by 20\u00a0        \n  Emissions      location-a\u2026    percent by    \n  (Categories    procurement    2025 (from a  \n  1-14) by 50    in the         baseline      \n  percent by     markets        year of       \n  2030           where we       2019).        \n  (from a        operate.                     \n  baseline                                    \n  year of                                     \n  2019).                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  Continue to    Pursue the                   \n  ensure 95      U.S. Green                   \n  percent of     Building                     \n  paper          Council\u2019s                    \n  purchased      Leadership     Reduce        \n  for            in Energy      landfill      \n  operations     and            waste         \n  is             Environmen\u2026    generated at  \n  certified      Design         our campus    \n  by             (LEED)         locations by  \n  the Forest     Silver or      50\u00a0percent    \n  Stewardship    higher         by 2025       \n  Council or     certificat\u2026    (from a       \n  contains 30    for all new    baseline      \n  percent        office         year of       \n  post-consu\u2026    constructi\u2026    2019)         \n  waste          and                          \n  recycled       comprehens\u2026                  \n  content        renovation\u2026                  \n  each year.                                  \n                                              \nHighlights of our environmental sustainability\nefforts include:                              \n                                              \n       Operational Emissions. In an effort    \n       to continue our reduction in           \n       operational emissions, we performed    \n       an analysis in 2022 to gain a deeper   \n       understanding of the key business      \n       drivers and leverage points that       \n  \u220e    impact these emissions. This analysis  \n       is helping to align our action plans   \n       with continued progress towards our    \n       GHG emissions reduction goals, while   \n       also building the foundation to        \n       evaluate potential future reductions   \n       in these emissions.                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Internal Price on Carbon. In 2020,     \n       Capital One established an internal    \n       price on carbon starting at $15.00     \n       per metric ton of carbon dioxide       \n       equivalent, or CO2e, for Scope 1,      \n  \u220e    Scope 2 and verified Scope 3 (in       \n       categories 1-14) emissions. This       \n       carbon fee creates a monetary value    \n       on the GHG emissions in our carbon     \n       footprint, which can enable greater    \n       visibility and incentive alignment in  \n       the future.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n       Financed Emissions. Financed           \n       emissions are the GHG emissions        \n       associated with our lending            \n       activities and investments (Scope 3,   \n       category 15). In 2022, we engaged      \n       with a third party to better           \n       understand the drivers and impact of   \n       our financed emissions. We have        \n       completed an initial assessment of     \n  \u220e    our financed emissions and             \n       significant concentrations. While      \n       this initial assessment is reliant on  \n       data from multiple sources, including  \n       our clients, that is not fully         \n       complete, and does not currently have  \n       the same level of controls as our      \n       public emissions disclosures, it is    \n       useful to help guide our work within   \n       our businesses                         \n                                              \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  54    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  toward the areas of highest leverage.

Our Commercial    \n       Bank has a dedicated Sustainable       \n       Finance team that works to assess and  \n       address the risks and opportunities    \n       posed by the changing environmental    \n       and social landscape to best prepare   \n       our clients and our business. While    \n       we remain rooted in our local          \n       communities, we have scaled            \n       nationally and invested in our         \n       capabilities to support Commercial     \n       Bank clients who desire to transition  \n  \u220e    to a low-carbon economy.

We have also instituted several climate-\nspecific governance processes at both the     \nenterprise and line of business levels, which \nroll up through our broader enterprise ESG    \ngovernance structure. The Board is actively   \nengaged in the development of Capital One\u2019s   \nenterprise climate strategy and risk          \nmanagement, including climate-related goals   \nand targets. The Board receives updates from  \nmanagement on our enterprise-wide climate     \nstrategy and risk management at least once per\nyear. Capital One\u2019s senior leadership also    \nintegrates climate considerations into        \nindividual line of business strategies where  \nappropriate. Climate and other ESG-           \nrelatedissues are also discussed in existing  \nsenior management committees at Capital One.  \nFor more information on climate governance see\n\u201cOversight of Environmental, Social and       \nGovernance Matters\u201d beginning on page 48.     \nClimate Risk Management Capital One looks at  \nhow risks, including climate-related risks,   \ncould impact our Company across seven risk    \ncategories each quarter. We also identify     \nemerging risks that may occur across a longer \ntime horizon, happen in the future, or have a \npotential impact that is difficult to predict.\nThe seven risk categories we use to evaluate  \nclimate risks are consistent with those we use\nto evaluate and manage all of our enterprise  \nrisks: credit, operational, strategic,        \nreputational, market, liquidity and compliance\nrisks. As we continue to enhance climate risk \nmanagement capabilities, and in alignment with\nemerging regulatory guidance, we will conduct \nclimate-specific scenario analysis to better  \nunderstand the long-term impact of climate    \nchange on our portfolios. We will also        \ncontinue to improve our risk identification   \nprocess to take climate-related risks into    \nconsideration when making decisions across the\nenterprise.                                   \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            55  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nHow to Contact Us                             \n                                              \n  Our Directors         Investor Relations    \n  Communicate with                            \n  the Board,                                  \n  including                                   \n  individual                                  \n  directors, the                              \n  Lead                                        \n  Independent                                 \n  Director,                                   \n  committee chairs,                           \n  or the Independent    Contact our Investor  \n  Directors as a        Relations team \u00a0      \n  group                 Email:                \n  Mail                  investorrelations@c\u2026  \n  correspondence to:                          \n  Board of Directors                          \n  c/o Corporate                               \n  Secretary\u2019s Office                          \n  Capital One                                 \n  Financial                                   \n  Corporation 1600                            \n  Capital One Drive                           \n  McLean, Virginia                            \n  22102                                       \n                                              \nThe Corporate Secretary will review all       \ncommunications sent to the Board, the Lead    \nIndependent Director, committee chairs, the   \nIndependent Directors as a group, or          \nindividual directors and forward all          \nsubstantive communications to the appropriate \nparties.

Capital\nOne previously proposed amendments at our 2013\nand 2014 Annual Stockholder Meetings to remove\nthe supermajority voting requirements         \ncurrently in the Certificate, however, the    \nproposals did not receive the required number \nof votes to pass. In connection with those    \nmeetings, we actively solicited stockholders  \nto vote for the amendments, including engaging\ndirectly with some of our largest             \nstockholders. While non-InterestedStockholders\n(as defined in the Certificate) owning 79.99% \nof the then outstanding Voting Stock (as      \ndefined below) voted in favor of the          \namendments in 2013 and 77.44% in 2014,        \nrespectively, these levels of support were not\nsufficient to approve the amendments, each of \nwhich required an affirmative vote of 80% of  \nthe then outstanding Voting Stock excluding   \nany Interested Stockholder. The Board of      \nDirectors believes that the amendments as set \nforth below are appropriate and we are asking \nstockholders to vote \u201cFor\u201d these Proposed     \nAmendments. References in this discussion to  \nvotes of the outstanding shares and to the    \n\u201cVoting Stock\u201d mean the Company\u2019s outstanding \nshares of capital stock entitled to vote      \ngenerally in the election of directors.       \nCurrently, Capital One common stock is the    \nonly class or series of Voting Stock          \noutstanding. The Proposed Amendments do not   \naffect the voting rights of the Company\u2019s     \npreferred stock. If the amendments to the     \nCertificate are approved at this meeting, our \nCertificate or our Amended and Restated Bylaws\nwill not contain any supermajority provisions.\nWe strongly encourage you to vote \u201cFOR\u201d this  \nproposal. Purpose and Effect of the Proposed  \nAmendments The Proposed Amendments are the    \nresult of the Board\u2019s ongoing review of our   \ncorporate governance principles. After        \nreceiving stockholder input and the advice of \nmanagement and outside advisors, the Board    \nconsidered the relative weight of the         \narguments in favor of and opposed to          \nsupermajority voting requirements related to  \ncertain business combinations. The Board      \nrecognizes that supermajority voting          \nrequirements for business combinations are    \nintended to protect against self-interested   \naction by large stockholders, including in the\ncontext of hostile acquisitions that may be   \nviewed as undervaluing the Company, by        \nrequiring broad stockholder support for       \ncertain types of transactions or governance   \nchanges. The Board also recognizes that many  \ninvestors and others have begun to view       \nsupermajority vote provisions as conflicting  \nwith principles of good corporate governance. \nAccordingly, the Board has considered this    \nmatter and, upon recommendation of the        \nGovernance and Nominating Committee, adopted  \nresolutions setting forth the Proposed        \nAmendments, declared the Proposed Amendments  \nadvisable and unanimously resolved to submit  \nthe Proposed Amendments to Capital One\u2019s      \nstockholders for consideration.               \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            57  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section III - Approval of Amendments to     \n  Capital                                     \n  One Financial Corporation\u2019s Restated        \n  Certificate                                 \n  of Incorporation to Remove Remaining        \n  Supermajority                               \n  Voting Requirements and References to       \n  Signet                                      \n  Banking Corporation (Item 2 on Proxy Card)  \n                                              \nProposed Certificate Amendments Remove        \nSupermajority Voting Requirements Related to  \nCertain Business Combinations Description of  \nAmendments Currently, Article IX of the       \nCertificate has supermajority voting          \nprovisions applicable to certain business     \ncombinations between Capital One and          \nInterested Stockholders and requires that: (i)\nany such business combinations be approved by \n75% of the outstanding Voting Stock (including\n75% of non-InterestedStockholders) and (ii) an\namendment of any provision of Article IX,     \nincluding the supermajority voting provision, \nbe approved by 80% of the outstanding Voting  \nStock (including 80% of non-                  \nInterestedStockholders). We propose to amend  \nthe Certificate so that such transactions or  \namendments can be approved by a majority vote \nof the voting power of the then outstanding   \nVoting Stock, voting together as a single     \nclass. Specifically, we propose:              \n                                              \n       to amend the supermajority voting      \n       requirements for approval of certain   \n       business combinations currently in     \n  \u220e    Article IX, Section\u00a01, Paragraph (A)\u00a0  \n       of the Certificate by replacing the    \n       references to \u201c75%\u201d with \u201ca            \n       majority;\u201d and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       to amend the supermajority voting      \n       requirements for amending or           \n       repealing, or adopting any provision   \n       inconsistent with Article IX of the    \n  \u220e    Certificate (regarding the approval    \n       of certain business combinations)      \n       currently in Article IX, Section\u00a06 of  \n       the Certificate by replacing the       \n       references to \u201c80%\u201d with \u201ca            \n       majority.\u201d                             \n                                              \nIf these amendments are approved, future      \nstockholder votes under these provisions would\nrequire the affirmative vote of the holders of\nat least a majority of the voting power of the\nthen outstanding Voting Stock, voting together\nas a single class, including the affirmative  \nvote of the holders of at least a majority of \nthe voting power of the then outstanding      \nVoting Stock not owned directly or indirectly \nby any Interested Stockholder. The amended    \nvoting requirements in Article IX, Section 1, \nParagraph (A) for approval of certain business\ncombinations would continue to be required in \naddition to any affirmative vote required by  \nlaw or the Certificate (including any votes   \nrequired by the terms of any series of        \npreferred stock). Opt out of Section 203 of   \nthe Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) \nDescription of Amendments Currently, we are   \nsubject to a default supermajority provision  \nunder DGCL 203, which relates to stockholder  \napproval of business combinations with        \ninterested stockholders, requiring the        \naffirmative vote of at least 66 2\u2044 3% of the  \noutstanding voting stock that is not owned by \nthe interested stockholder. Specifically,     \nSection 203(a)(3) of the DGCL states that: \u201cAt\nor subsequent to such time the business       \ncombination is approved by the board of       \ndirectors and authorized at an annual or      \nspecial meeting of stockholders, and not by   \nwritten consent, by the affirmative vote of at\nleast 66 2\u2044 3% of the outstanding voting stock\nwhich is not owned by the interested          \nstockholder\u201d (the \u201c66 2\u2044 3% Level\u201d). We       \npropose to amend the Certificate so that the  \nCompany will expressly elect not to be        \ngoverned by the DGCL 203, in order to         \neliminate the 66 2\u2044 3% Level.

Signet Banking was created from \nthe merger of Bank of Virginia and Union Trust\nBancorp in 1985.

Director Compensation    \nProcedures The Committee annually reviews the \ncompensation program for Capital One\u2019s non-   \nmanagementdirectors. FW Cook provides         \ncompetitive compensation data and director    \ncompensation program recommendations to the   \nCommittee to assist in determining its        \nrecommendation. The competitive compensation  \ndata includes information regarding the       \ncompensation (cash, equity, and other         \nbenefits) of the non-managementdirectors      \nwithin Capital One\u2019s peer comparator group.   \nThe Committee considers this information and  \nFW Cook\u2019s recommendations, and finalizes a    \nproposed director compensation structure for  \nreview and approval by the full Board,        \ntypically in the second quarter of each year. \nSee the discussion under \u201cCompensation        \nCommittee Consultant\u201d beginning on page 43 for\nfurther information on the role and           \nresponsibilities of FW Cook and \u201cPeer Groups\u201d \nbeginning on page 115 for further information \non the selection of the Company\u2019s peer        \ncomparator group. Based on its review of      \ncompetitive market data and guidance from FW  \nCook in the second quarter of 2022, the       \nCommittee determined that the Company\u2019s       \ndirector compensation program meets the       \nobjectives listed above. Director Compensation\nStructure On May 4, 2022, the Board approved a\ncompensation program for Capital One\u2019s non-   \nmanagementdirectors for the period from May 5,\n2022 through our 2023 Annual Stockholder      \nMeeting that is similar to the program for the\npreceding year. The compensation program      \nconsists of an annual cash retainer of $90,000\nfor service on the Board. Annual cash         \nretainers for service as a member of the Board\nhave not increased since 2013. In addition,   \ndirectors receive annual cash retainers for   \ncommittee service and for service as committee\nchairs and Lead Independent Director. Under   \nthe most recently approved director           \ncompensation program, the annual cash         \nretainers are as follows:                     \n                                            \n  \u220e    Lead Independent Director: $100,000  \n                                            \n                                              \n  \u220e    Chair of the Audit Committee or Risk   \n       Committee: $70,000                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Chair of the Compensation Committee:   \n       $45,000                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Chair of the Governance and            \n       Nominating Committee: $45,000          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Member of the Audit Committee or Risk  \n  \u220e    Committee (other than the chair):      \n       $30,000                                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Member of the Compensation Committee   \n  \u220e    or Governance and Nominating           \n       Committee (other than the chair):      \n       $15,000                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    Member of the Capital One, N.A.

The increases to the annual cash        \nretainers was in recognition of the demands of\nservice of each such positions, including the \ntime commitment and level of contribution     \nexpected, and to further align compensation   \nfor such service with the Company\u2019s peer      \ncomparator group. In addition, each non-      \nmanagementdirector serving on May 5, 2022,    \nreceived on such date an award of 1,612 RSUs  \nunder the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan with a    \ngrant date fair value of $210,092, or $130.33 \nper share. The RSU award reflects an          \napproximately $10,000 increase in value over  \nthe previous year, which was intended to      \nbetter align director compensation with the   \nCompany\u2019s peer comparator group. The RSUs were\nvalued based on the fair market value of a    \nshare of Capital One common stock on the date \nof grant and vest one year from the date of   \ngrant, with the delivery of the underlying    \nshares deferred until the director\u2019s service  \nwith the Board ends in order to enhance the   \nalignment of interests between our non-       \nmanagementdirectors and stockholders. Other   \nBenefits Under the Capital One Financial      \nCorporation Non-EmployeeDirectors Deferred    \nCompensation Plan, non-managementdirectors may\nvoluntarily defer all or a portion of their   \ncash compensation and receive deferred income \nbenefits. Participants in the plan can direct \ntheir individual deferrals among ten          \ninvestments available through the plan.       \nParticipating directors receive their deferred\nincome benefits in cash when they cease       \nserving as directors, upon certain other      \ndistribution events specified in the plan, or \nat such earlier time as authorized by the     \nCompensation Committee. Upon a change of      \ncontrol, Capital One will pay to each director\nwithin 30 days of the change of control a lump\nsum cash payment equal to such director\u2019s     \naccount balance as of the date of the change  \nof control. Capital One also offers non-      \nmanagementdirectors the opportunity to direct \na contribution of up to $10,000 annually from \nCapital One to charitable organization(s) of  \ntheir choice. Nine of the eleven non-         \nmanagementdirectors who served during 2022    \nelected to make such a charitable contribution\nin 2022. In addition, all directors who served\nduring 2022 were eligible, and six directors  \nelected, to participate in a Capital One      \nbroad-based charitable contribution program,  \nwhich is available to Capital One associates, \nunder which Capital One made a contribution of\n$5,000 per director to a charitable           \norganization of their choice.

The         \n       outstanding options expire ten years   \n       from the date of grant. In 2013, the   \n  (1)  Committee determined to no longer      \n       include stock options as part of the   \n       director compensation program.

The Board may grant an exception for any\ncase where this requirement would impose a    \nfinancial hardship on a director. In 2022, no \ndirectors were granted an exception to this   \nrequirement for any outstanding awards of     \nRSUs. Our non-managementdirector stock        \nownership policies also require our non-      \nmanagementdirectors to hold a number of shares\nof Capital One common stock with a fair market\nvalue of at least five times the director\u2019s   \nannual cash retainer for Board service.       \nDirectors are given five years from the date  \nof appointment as a director to comply with   \nthe Stock Ownership Requirements. For purposes\nof this policy, unvested RSUs and vested      \ndeferred RSUs held by a Board member are      \ncounted as shares when determining the number \nof shares owned.

While      \nCapital One\u2019s executive compensation programs \nare designed to reward performance over multi-\nyear time horizons, the Board recognizes that \nexecutive compensation disclosures are an     \nimportant consideration for stockholders on an\nannual basis. Although it may not be feasible \nto immediately change the compensation program\nin response to an advisory vote on            \ncompensation, holding an annual advisory vote \non executive compensation provides Capital One\nwith important and regular feedback on our    \ncompensation practices to advance our goal of \naligning our executives\u2019 interests with those \nof our stockholders. Stockholders will be able\nto specify one of four choices for this       \nproposal on the proxy card: one year, two     \nyears, three years or abstain. Stockholders   \nare not voting to approve or disapprove the   \nBoard\u2019s recommendation. This advisory vote on \nthe frequency of future advisory votes to     \napprove executive compensation is non-        \nbindingon the Board. Notwithstanding the      \nBoard\u2019s recommendation and the outcome of the \nstockholder vote, the Board may in the future \ndecide to conduct advisory votes on a more or \nless frequent basis and may vary its practice \nbased on factors such as discussions with     \nstockholders and the adoption of material     \nchanges to compensation programs. Following   \nthis year\u2019s say on pay frequency vote, it is  \nexpected that the next such vote will take    \nplace at the 2029 Annual Stockholder Meeting. \n*** The Board unanimously recommends that you \nvote to conduct future advisory votes to      \napprove executive compensation \u201cEVERY YEAR.\u201d  \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  64    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection VI - Advisory Vote on Our Named       \nExecutive Officer Compensation (\u201cSay On Pay\u201d) \n(Item 4 on Proxy Card) We are offering to our \nstockholders a non-bindingadvisory vote to    \napprove our 2022 NEO compensation, pursuant to\nSection 14A of the Exchange Act. While the    \nvote is non-binding,the Board values the      \nopinions that stockholders express through    \ntheir votes and in any additional dialogue.   \nThe Board will consider the outcome of the    \nvote when making future compensation          \ndecisions. As discussed in the \u201cCompensation  \nDiscussion and Analysis\u201d section beginning on \npage 78, our Board has provided compensation  \nprograms for the CEO and the other NEOs that  \nare competitive with the market, performance- \nbased, and transparent and that align with our\nstockholders\u2019 interests over multiple time    \nhorizons. Our CEO\u2019s and other NEOs\u2019           \ncompensation programs have consisted primarily\nof performance-based incentive opportunities, \nincluding multiple types of equity instruments\nwith multi-year vesting schedules. The        \nultimate value of these equity-based awards is\nsubject to Capital One\u2019s sustained performance\nover time, both on an absolute basis and      \nrelative to our peers. For the 2022           \nperformance year, approximately 84% of the    \nCEO\u2019s total compensation is equity-based and  \nat-riskto the Company\u2019s performance and 100%  \nof his compensation is deferred for a three-  \nyear period. As discussed under \u201cNEO          \nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 106, under the\n2022 NEO compensation program applicable to   \nour other NEOs , approximately 51% of total   \ncompensation is provided through equity-based \nvehicles which were all at-riskbased on the   \nCompany\u2019s performance and subject to vesting  \nover multiple time horizons.

The       \nCompensation Committee of the Board approved  \nand adopted the Fourth Amended and Restated   \n2004 Stock Incentive Plan effective as of     \nJanuary 1, 2018 to make certain non-          \nmaterialchanges. The Fifth Amended and        \nRestated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan was        \nsubmitted for approval, and subsequently      \napproved, by stockholders at the annual       \nmeeting held on May 2, 2019 to account for    \nchanges to Section 162(m) of the Internal     \nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nOn January 26, 2023, the Compensation         \nCommittee adopted, subject to stockholder     \napproval, an amended and restated version of  \nthe 2004 Plan (the \u201cSeventh Amended and       \nRestated 2004 Plan\u201d) to increase the share    \nreserve under the 2004 Plan by 14 million     \nshares from 67 million shares to 81 million   \nshares as reflected in the Seventh Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan, which is provided in its  \nentirety as Appendix C to this proxy          \nstatement. The Seventh Amended and Restated   \n2004 Plan will be approved by stockholders if \na majority of the votes cast by stockholders  \non the proposal are voted in favor of the     \nproposal. NYSE rules governing equity         \ncompensation plans treat abstentions as \u201cvotes\ncast.\u201d Accordingly, abstentions will have the \nsame effect as a vote against the proposal.   \nHowever, broker non-votesare not considered   \n\u201cvotes cast\u201d and thus will have no effect on  \nthe outcome of the vote on this proposal.     \nSpecifically, the Seventh Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan makes the following changes that are\nsubject to stockholder approval:              \n                                              \n       Provides that the maximum number of    \n       Shares (as defined below) available    \n  \u220e    for issuance to participants under     \n       the 2004 Plan shall be 81\u00a0million      \n       (see Section\u00a04.1(a) of the 2004        \n       Plan).                                 \n                                              \nThe 2004 Plan, amended as of May 6, 2021,     \ncreated a reserve of 67 million shares of     \nCapital One common stock (each a \u201cShare,\u201d     \ncollectively, the \u201cShares\u201d). The 2004 Plan    \nShare reserve may not be sufficient to cover  \nthe awards anticipated to be granted beginning\nin 2024 and therefore we are asking for       \nstockholders to approve an increase of 14     \nmillion Shares in the 2004 Plan\u2019s Share       \nreserve at this time. The Compensation        \nCommittee and the Board believe that          \ncompensating Capital One executives and       \nassociates with equity awards encourages the  \ncreation of long-term stockholder value and   \nthe delivery of consistent medium- and long-  \nterm results.

Eligibility All employees of  \nCapital One, its affiliates and its           \nsubsidiaries and members of the Board are     \neligible to be granted Awards under the       \nSeventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan.       \nCertain individual consultants, agents,       \nadvisors and independent contractors who      \nrender services to Capital One (\u201cThird Party  \nService Providers\u201d) are also eligible to      \nparticipate in the Seventh Amended and        \nRestated 2004 Plan. As stated above, the basis\nfor participation in the Seventh Amended and  \nRestated 2004 Plan is the Compensation        \nCommittee\u2019s decision to select, in its sole   \ndiscretion, participants from among those     \neligible. The approximate number of           \nindividuals eligible to be granted Awards     \nunder the Seventh Amended and Restated 2004   \nPlan as of December 31, 2022 were 55,943      \nemployees, 11 non-managementdirectors and     \n11,956 Third Party Service Providers,         \nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, there  \nwere no Third Party Service Providers with    \noutstanding awards under the Seventh Amended  \nand Restated 2004 Plan. In lieu of making     \nAwards directly to employees, directors or    \nThird Party Service Providers, the            \nCompensation Committee may make Awards under  \nthe Seventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan    \nthrough or to a trust or other funding vehicle\nwhich then makes Awards to participants or    \nwhich issues interests in Awards held by it to\nparticipants, on such terms and conditions as \ndetermined by the Compensation Committee.     \nGeneral Terms and Conditions of Awards In     \ngeneral, and subject to the terms and         \nprovisions of the Seventh Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan (including those described below),  \nAwards may be granted to participants on such \ndates, in such form and number and upon such  \nterms and conditions (including the effect, if\nany, of a Change of Control, death, Disability\nor Retirement (as each such term is defined in\nthe Seventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan))  \nas determined from time to time by the        \nCompensation Committee. Each Award granted    \nwill be evidenced by an Award agreement that  \nwill specify such terms and conditions. In    \naddition, each participant\u2019s Award agreement  \nwill set forth the extent to which the        \nparticipant will have the right to exercise,  \nretain or receive an Award or to have such    \nAward vest or pay out, as applicable,         \nfollowing the termination of such             \nparticipant\u2019s employment with, or provision of\nservices to, Capital One, its affiliates or   \nsubsidiaries, as the case may be. Except as   \notherwise provided in the Seventh Amended and \nRestated 2004 Plan, in a participant\u2019s Award  \nagreement or as otherwise determined at any   \ntime by the Compensation Committee, no Award  \ngranted under the Seventh Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged,  \nassigned or otherwise alienated or            \nhypothecated, other than by will or by the    \nlaws of descent and distribution. The         \nCompensation Committee may specify in an Award\nagreement that the participant\u2019s rights,      \npayments and benefits with respect to an Award\nwill be subject to reduction, cancellation,   \nforfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence  \nof certain specified events, in addition to   \nany otherwise applicable vesting or           \nperformance conditions. Failure by a          \nparticipant to comply with any of the terms   \nand conditions of the Seventh Amended and     \nRestated 2004 Plan or any Award agreement will\nbe grounds for the cancellation and forfeiture\nof such Award. Restricted Stock and RSUs. The \nCompensation Committee may grant to a         \nparticipant Shares of restricted stock and/or \nRSUs. RSUs are similar to Shares of restricted\nstock except that no Shares are actually      \nawarded to the participant on the date of     \ngrant. The Shares of restricted stock and/or  \nthe RSUs granted to a participant under the   \nSeventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will   \nnot be transferable until the end of the      \napplicable period of restriction established  \nby the Compensation Committee (and in the case\nof RSUs until the date of delivery of Shares  \nor other payment), or upon earlier            \nsatisfaction of any other conditions as       \nspecified by the Compensation Committee. The  \nCompensation Committee will impose such other \nconditions and/or restrictions on any Shares  \nof restricted stock or RSUs as it may deem    \nadvisable, including a requirement that the   \nparticipant pay a stipulated purchase price   \nfor each Share of restricted stock or each    \nRSU, restrictions based upon achievement of   \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  70    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Approval and Adoption of the  \n  Capital                                     \n  One Financial Corporation Seventh Amended   \n  and                                         \n  Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (Item 5  \n  on                                          \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nperformance goals, service-based restrictions \nand/or restrictions under applicable laws or  \nunder the requirements of any stock exchange  \nor securities market upon which such Shares   \nare listed or traded. For the avoidance of    \ndoubt, imposing restrictions based upon the   \nachievement of performance goals will not     \nresult in Shares of restricted stock or RSUs  \nbeing converted to performance shares or      \nperformance units for purposes of the Seventh \nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan, including for \npurposes of the annual award limits described \nabove. Generally, Shares of restricted stock  \nwill become freely transferable by the        \nparticipant after all conditions and          \nrestrictions applicable to such Shares have   \nbeen satisfied or lapse (including            \nsatisfaction of applicable tax withholding    \nobligations) and RSUs will be settled in cash,\nShares or a combination of cash and Shares, as\nthe Compensation Committee determines. To the \nextent permitted by law, unless otherwise     \ndetermined by the Compensation Committee and  \nset forth in an Award agreement, participants \nholding Shares of restricted stock will be    \ngranted the right to exercise full voting     \nrights and to receive all dividends and other \ndistributions paid with respect to those      \nShares during the period of restriction, while\nrecipients of RSUs will not be granted such   \nrights, dividends or distributions during the \nperiod of restriction, except as specifically \ndetermined by the Compensation Committee and  \nas permitted by law. Performance Units and    \nPerformance Shares .The Compensation Committee\nmay grant performance units and/or performance\nshares to participants under the Seventh      \nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan in such amounts\nand upon such terms as the Compensation       \nCommittee determines. Each performance unit   \nwill have an initial value that is established\nby the Compensation Committee at the time of  \ngrant and each performance share will have an \ninitial value equal to the fair market value  \nof a Share on the date of grant. In addition  \nto any non-performanceterms set forth by the  \nCompensation Committee, the Compensation      \nCommittee will set performance goals which,   \ndepending on the extent to which they are met,\nwill determine the value and/or number of     \nperformance units or performance shares to be \npaid out to participants. In accordance with  \nthe Award agreements, participants will be    \nentitled to payment, in the form of cash      \nand/or Shares, equal to the value and number  \nof applicable performance units and           \nperformance shares earned by participants over\nthe designated performance period following   \nthe end of such performance period. Options.  \nThe Compensation Committee may grant to a     \nparticipant the right to purchase Shares in   \nsuch amounts and upon such terms as the       \nCompensation Committee determines (including  \nin satisfaction of Capital One\u2019s obligations  \npursuant to options with reload features      \ngranted under the prior stock incentive       \nplans), subject to the following restrictions.\nAn option may be granted as an ISO or as an   \nNQSO, as determined by the Compensation       \nCommittee and as set forth in any applicable  \nAward agreement. The exercise price per Share \nwill be determined by the Compensation        \nCommittee and may be at, above or indexed to, \nthe fair market value of a Share on the date  \nof grant; provided that, in no event will the \nexercise price per Share be less than 100% of \nthe fair market value of a Share on the date  \nof grant. Options granted under the Seventh   \nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan will vest and  \nbecome exercisable at such time and upon such \nterms and conditions as may be determined by  \nthe Compensation Committee; provided that no  \noption will be exercisable later than the     \ntenth anniversary of its date of grant.       \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, options granted\nto participants outside of the United States  \nmay have a term of greater than ten years. The\npurchase price for the Shares as to which an  \noption is exercised will be paid to Capital   \nOne in full at the time of exercise (i) in    \ncash or its equivalent; (ii) in Shares having \na fair market value equal to the aggregate    \nexercise price for the Shares being purchased \nand satisfying such other requirements as may \nbe imposed by the Compensation Committee;     \n(iii) partly in cash and partly in such       \nShares; (iv) by a cashless (broker-assisted)  \nexercise; or (v) by any other method approved \nor accepted by the Compensation Committee. The\nCompensation Committee may impose such        \nrestrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant  \nto the exercise of an option granted under the\nSeventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan as it  \nmay deem advisable, including, without        \nlimitation, minimum holding period            \nrequirements, restrictions under applicable   \nfederal securities laws, under the            \nrequirements of any stock exchange or market  \nupon which such Shares are then listed and/or \ntraded, or under any blue sky or state        \nsecurities laws applicable to such Shares.    \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            71  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Approval and Adoption of the  \n  Capital                                     \n  One Financial Corporation Seventh Amended   \n  and                                         \n  Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (Item 5  \n  on                                          \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nThe Compensation Committee is not permitted to\ngrant options containing, or amend options    \npreviously granted to include, reload features\nproviding for the automatic grant of options  \nwith respect to the number of already owned   \nShares delivered by the participant to        \nexercise options. SARs. The Compensation      \nCommittee may grant to a participant an SAR   \nindependent of an option or in tandem with an \noption or designated portion thereof at the   \ntime the related option is granted or at any  \ntime prior to the exercise or cancellation of \nthe related option. The grant price of an SAR \nthat is either granted independently of any   \noptions or the exercise of which does not     \nrequire the forfeiture of any rights under a  \nrelated option (a \u201cFreestanding SAR\u201d) will be \ndetermined by the Compensation Committee;     \nprovided that, in no event will the grant     \nprice per Share be less than 100% of the fair \nmarket value of a Share on the date of grant. \nThe grant price of an SAR that is granted in  \nconnection with a related option and the      \nexercise of which requires the forfeiture of  \nthe right to purchase Shares under the related\noption (a \u201cTandem SAR\u201d) will be equal to the  \nexercise price of the related option. The term\nof an SAR granted under the Seventh Amended   \nand Restated 2004 Plan will be determined by  \nthe Compensation Committee; provided that no  \nSAR will be exercisable later than the tenth  \nanniversary of the date of its grant.         \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, SARs granted to\nparticipants outside of the United States may \nhave a term of greater than ten years.        \nFreestanding SARs may be exercised upon the   \nterms and conditions as imposed by the        \nCompensation Committee and Tandem SARs may    \nonly be exercised with respect to all or part \nof the Shares subject to the related option   \nupon the surrender of the right to exercise   \nthe equivalent portion of the related option. \nUpon the exercise of an SAR, the participant  \nwill be entitled to receive, with respect to  \neach Share to which such SAR relates, an      \namount in cash and/or Shares, as the case may \nbe, equal to the excess of (i) the fair market\nvalue of a Share on the date of exercise over \n(ii) the grant price of the SAR. The          \nCompensation Committee may impose such        \nrestrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant  \nto the exercise of an SAR granted under the   \nSeventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan as it  \nmay deem advisable, including, without        \nlimitation, a requirement that the participant\nhold the Shares received upon exercise of an  \nSAR for a specified period of time. Cash-Based\nAwards and Other Stock-Based Awards. The      \nCompensation Committee may grant cash-based   \nAwards and Other Stock-Based Awards to        \nparticipants, in such amounts and upon such   \nterms and conditions as the Compensation      \nCommittee may determine. Other Stock-Based    \nAwards may include Awards designed to comply  \nwith or take advantage of the applicable local\nlaws of jurisdictions outside of the United   \nStates. Each cash-based Award will specify a  \npayment amount or payment range and each Other\nStock-Based Award will be expressed in terms  \nof Shares or units based on Shares, each as   \ndetermined by the Compensation Committee. The \nCompensation Committee may also establish any \nperformance goals with respect to cash-based  \nAwards or Other Stock-Based Awards, in which  \ncase the number and/or value of cash-based    \nAwards or Other Stock-Based Awards that will  \nbe paid out to the participant will depend on \nthe extent to which the performance goals (and\nany other non-performanceterms and conditions)\nare met. Payment with respect to a cash-based \nAward or Other Stock-Based Award will be made \nin accordance with the terms of the Award, in \ncash and/or Shares as determined by the       \nCompensation Committee. Performance-Based     \nCompensation. The Compensation Committee may  \ngrant Awards to participants that are subject \nto performance goals upon which the grant,    \npayment or vesting of an Award may occur. The \nperformance goals will be set at the          \ndiscretion of the Compensation Committee and  \ncan include, but are not limited to, the      \nfollowing performance measures, either        \nindividually, alternatively, or in any        \ncombination, applied to either Capital One as \na whole or to a business unit or subsidiary or\naffiliate or any combination thereof, either  \nindividually, alternatively or in any         \ncombination, and measured either annually or  \ncumulatively over a period of years, on an    \nabsolute basis or relative to a pre-          \nestablishedtarget, to previous years\u2019 results \nor to a designated comparison group, in each  \ncase as specified by the Compensation         \nCommittee: net earnings or net income (before \nor after taxes); earnings per share; net sales\ngrowth; net operating profit; return measures \n(including, but not                           \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  72    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Approval and Adoption of the  \n  Capital                                     \n  One Financial Corporation Seventh Amended   \n  and                                         \n  Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (Item 5  \n  on                                          \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nlimited to return on assets, capital, equity  \nor sales); cash flow (including, but not      \nlimited to, operating cash flow, free cash    \nflow, and cash flow return on capital); cash  \nflow per share; earnings before or after      \ntaxes, interest, depreciation and/or          \namortization; gross or operating margins;     \nproductivity ratios; share price (including,  \nbut not limited to, growth measures and total \nstockholder return); expense targets or       \nratios; charge-offlevels; revenue growth;     \ndeposit growth; margins; operating efficiency;\noperating expenses; economic value added;     \nimprovement in or attainment of expense       \nlevels; improvement in or attainment of       \nworking capital levels; debt reduction;       \ncapital targets; consummation of acquisitions,\ndispositions, projects or other specific      \nevents or transactions; and any other         \nperformance goal that the Compensation        \nCommittee deems appropriate. The Compensation \nCommittee may provide for accelerated vesting \nof any Award based on the achievement of      \nperformance goals pursuant to the performance \nmeasures set forth by the Compensation        \nCommittee with respect to such Award. The     \nCompensation Committee will determine whether,\nwith respect to a performance period, the     \napplicable performance goals have been met    \nwith respect to a given participant and, if   \nthey have, to so certify and ascertain the    \namount of the applicable Award. The           \nCompensation Committee may provide in any such\nAward that any evaluation of performance may  \ninclude or exclude any of the following events\nthat occurs during a performance period: (i)  \nasset write-downs, (ii) litigation or claim   \njudgments or settlements, (iii) the effect of \nchanges in tax laws, accounting principles or \nregulations, or other laws or provisions      \naffecting reported results, (iv) any          \nreorganization and restructuring programs, (v)\nextraordinary, unusual, and/or nonrecurring   \nitems of gain or loss as defined under United \nStates generally accepted accounting          \nprinciples for the applicable year, (vi)      \nmergers, acquisitions or divestitures, and    \n(vii) foreign exchange gains and losses.      \nAnnual Incentive Pool Awards. The Compensation\nCommittee may designate employees who are     \neligible to receive a monetary payment in any \nplan year based upon a percentage of an       \nincentive pool equal to the greater of (i) 3% \nof Capital One\u2019s Consolidated Operating       \nEarnings for the plan year, (ii) 20% of       \nCapital One\u2019s Operating Cash Flow for the plan\nyear, and (iii) 5% of Capital One\u2019s Net Income\nfor the plan year (as each such term is       \ndefined in the Seventh Amended and Restated   \n2004 Plan). The Compensation Committee will   \nallocate an incentive pool percentage to each \nparticipating employee for each plan year;    \nprovided that the incentive pool percentage   \nfor any one participant may not exceed 50% of \nthe total pool, the sum of the incentive pool \npercentages for all participants cannot exceed\n100% of the total pool and the monetary       \npayment for any one participant may not exceed\n$10 million. As soon as possible following the\ndetermination of the incentive pool for a plan\nyear, the Compensation Committee will         \ncalculate each participant\u2019s portion of the   \nincentive pool based upon the percentage      \nestablished at the beginning of the plan year.\nThe Compensation Committee retains the        \ndiscretion to adjust incentive pool downwards \nand provide for such other terms as it feels  \nnecessary or appropriate. Dividend            \nEquivalents. The Compensation Committee may   \ngrant dividend equivalents to any participant \nbased on the dividends declared on Shares that\nare subject to any Award. Such dividend       \nequivalents may be awarded or paid in the form\nof cash, Shares, restricted stock, RSUs or a  \ncombination thereof and will be determined by \nsuch formula and at such time and be subject  \nto such accrual, forfeiture or payout         \nrestrictions or limitations as determined by  \nthe Compensation Committee in its discretion. \nDeferrals. The Compensation Committee may     \npermit or require a participant to defer his  \nor her receipt of the payment of cash or the  \ndelivery of Shares that would otherwise be due\nto such participant by virtue of the lapse or \nwaiver of restrictions with respect to Shares \nof restricted stock or RSUs, or the           \nsatisfaction of any requirements or           \nperformance goals with respect to performance \nshares, performance units, cash-based Awards, \nOther Stock-Based Awards and annual incentive \npool Awards. If any such deferral is required \nor permitted, the Compensation Committee will \nestablish rules and procedures for such       \npayment or Share delivery and any notional    \nearnings to be credited on such deferred      \namounts, provided that in the case of any     \nAward intended to qualify as \u201cperformance-    \nbased compensation,\u201d as such term was defined \nin Section 162(m) of the Code on December 21, \n2017, such earnings will be in compliance with\nCode Section 162(m).                          \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            73  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VII - Approval and Adoption of the  \n  Capital                                     \n  One Financial Corporation Seventh Amended   \n  and                                         \n  Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (Item 5  \n  on                                          \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nAmendment, Modification, Suspension and       \nTermination; No Repricings. The Compensation  \nCommittee may, at any time, alter, amend,     \nmodify, suspend or terminate the Seventh      \nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan and any Award  \nagreement in whole or in part; provided,      \nhowever, that no amendment of the Seventh     \nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan or an Award    \nwill be made without stockholder approval if  \nstockholder approval is required by law,      \nregulation, or stock exchange rule.           \nFurthermore, other than in connection with a  \nchange in Capital One\u2019s capitalization, the   \nCompensation Committee will not, without      \nstockholder approval, reduce the exercise     \nprice or grant price of a previously awarded  \noption or SAR and, at any time when the       \nexercise price or grant price of the          \npreviously awarded option or SAR is above the \nfair market value of a Share, the Compensation\nCommittee will not, without stockholder       \napproval, cancel and re-grantor exchange such \noption or SAR for cash or a new Award with a  \nlower (or no) exercise price or grant price or\ntake any other action that would be considered\na repricing for purposes of United States     \ngenerally accepted accounting principles or   \nany applicable stock exchange rule. No        \ntermination, amendment, suspension or         \nmodification of the Seventh Amended and       \nRestated 2004 Plan or an Award agreement will \nmaterially adversely affect any Award         \npreviously granted under the Seventh Amended  \nand Restated 2004 Plan without the written    \nconsent of the participant holding such Award.\nThe Compensation Committee may, however,      \nterminate any Award previously granted and any\nAward agreement relating thereto in whole or  \nin part upon payment of certain consideration \n(as set forth in the Seventh Amended and      \nRestated 2004 Plan) or, in the case of options\nonly, 30 days after an acceleration of        \nexercisability. The Compensation Committee may\nauthorize the repurchase of any Award by      \nCapital One at any time for such price and on \nsuch terms and conditions as the Compensation \nCommittee may determine, provided that without\nthe prior approval of Capital One\u2019s           \nstockholders, the Compensation Committee may  \nnot permit the repurchase by Capital One of   \noptions or SARs with an exercise price or     \ngrant price, respectively, above the fair     \nmarket value of the Shares at the time of such\nrepurchase. The Compensation Committee may    \nmake adjustments in the terms and conditions  \nof, and the performance criteria included in, \nAwards in recognition of unusual or           \nnonrecurring events affecting Capital One or  \nthe financial statements of Capital One or of \nchanges in applicable laws, regulations or    \naccounting principles, whenever the           \nCompensation Committee determines that such   \nadjustments are appropriate in order to       \nprevent unintended dilution or enlargement of \nthe benefits to be made available under the   \nSeventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan.       \nSuccessors. All obligations of Capital One    \nunder the Seventh Amended and Restated 2004   \nPlan with respect to Awards granted thereunder\nwill be binding on any successor to Capital   \nOne, whether the existence of such successor  \nis the result of a direct or indirect         \npurchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise,\nof all or substantially all of the business   \nand/or assets of Capital One.

Participants may elect, or the     \nCompensation Committee may require, the       \nwithholding of Shares to satisfy the          \nparticipant\u2019s withholding obligations. Change \nof Control.

New Plan Benefits.    \nBecause benefits under the Seventh Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan will depend on the         \nCompensation Committee\u2019s actions and the fair \nmarket value of the Shares at various future  \ndates, it is not possible to determine the    \nbenefits that will be received by directors,  \nexecutive officers and other employees if the \nSeventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan is     \napproved by stockholders. As of December 30,  \n2022, the closing price of Capital One common \nstock was $92.96 per share. Equity            \nCompensation Plan Information.

The   \ndiscussion is intended solely for general     \ninformation and does not make specific        \nrepresentations to any Award recipient. A     \nrecipient\u2019s particular situation may be such  \nthat some variation of the basic rules is     \napplicable to him or her. In addition, the    \nfederal income tax laws and regulations       \nfrequently have been revised and may be       \nchanged again at any time. Therefore, each    \nrecipient is urged to consult a tax advisor   \nbefore exercising any award or before         \ndisposing of any shares acquired under the    \nSeventh Amended and Restated 2004 Plan both   \nwith respect to federal income tax            \nconsequences as well as any foreign, state or \nlocal tax consequences. The grant of an option\nor SAR will create no tax consequences for the\nparticipant or Capital One. A participant will\nnot generally recognize taxable income upon   \nexercising an ISO (except that the alternative\nminimum tax may apply). Upon exercising an    \noption other than an ISO, the participant must\ngenerally recognize ordinary income equal to  \nthe excess of the fair market value of the    \nfreely transferable and nonforfeitable Shares \nacquired on the date of exercise over the     \nexercise price. Upon exercise of an SAR, the  \nparticipant must generally recognize ordinary \nincome equal to the cash or the fair market   \nvalue of the freely transferable and          \nnonforfeitable Shares received. Upon a        \ndisposition of Shares acquired upon exercise  \nof an ISO before the end of the applicable ISO\nholding periods, the participant must         \ngenerally recognize ordinary income equal to  \nthe lesser of (i) the fair market value of the\nShares at the date of exercise of the ISO     \nminus the exercise price, or (ii) the amount  \nrealized upon the disposition of the ISO      \nShares minus the exercise price. Otherwise, a \nparticipant\u2019s disposition of Shares acquired  \nupon the exercise of an option (including an  \nISO for which the ISO holding periods are met)\ngenerally will result in capital gain or loss \nmeasured by the excess of the sale price over \nthe participant\u2019s tax basis in such Shares    \n(the tax basis generally being the exercise   \nprice plus any amount previously recognized as\nordinary income in connection with the        \nexercise of the option). Capital One generally\nwill be entitled to a tax deduction equal to  \nthe amount recognized as ordinary income by   \nthe participant in connection with an option  \nor SAR. Capital One generally is not entitled \nto a tax deduction relating to amounts that   \nrepresent a capital gain to a participant.    \nAccordingly, Capital One will not be entitled \nto any tax deduction with respect to an ISO if\nthe participant holds the Shares in           \nsatisfaction of the ISO holding periods prior \nto disposition of the Shares. With respect to \nAwards other than options and SARs involving  \nthe issuance of Shares or other property that \nis restricted as to transferability and       \nsubject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,  \nthe participant must generally recognize      \nordinary income equal to the fair market value\nof the Shares or other property received at   \nthe first time the Shares or other property   \nbecome transferable or no longer subject to a \nsubstantial risk of forfeiture, whichever     \noccurs earlier. Under the Seventh Amended and \nRestated 2004 Plan, a participant may be      \npermitted or required to elect to be taxed at \nthe time of receipt of Shares or other        \nproperty rather than upon lapse of            \nrestrictions on transferability or substantial\nrisk of forfeiture, but if the participant    \nsubsequently forfeits such Shares or property,\nthe participant would not be entitled to any  \ntax deduction, including as a capital loss,   \nfor the value of the Shares or property on    \nwhich he or she previously paid tax. In such  \ncase, the participant must file any such      \nelection with the Internal Revenue Service    \nwithin 30 days of the receipt of the Shares or\nother property. Capital One generally will be \nentitled to a deduction in an amount equal to \nthe ordinary income recognized by the         \nparticipant.

The Committee seeks to \ndirectly link the compensation of the NEOs    \nwith the Company\u2019s performance and the        \nexecutives\u2019 contributions to that performance \nover multiple time horizons. In 2022, Capital \nOne delivered very strong financial results   \nand made significant progress on our long-term\nstrategic initiatives, including investments  \nin transformation, talent, technology and     \ndigital capabilities and risk management.     \nDouble-digit revenue growth, sound through-   \ncycle underwriting, and very strong credit    \nperformance drove near-record profitability,  \nallowing the Company to invest for the long-  \nterm, distribute significant capital to       \nstockholders, and maintain a strong balance   \nsheet. Each of our major lines of business    \ndelivered solid growth and returns. Our       \nDomestic Card business delivered very strong  \nrevenue growth, enabled by the increase in    \ncredit card loan balances and strong new      \naccounts and record purchase volume. We       \ncontinued to expand our national Consumer Bank\nfranchise with 5.5% deposit growth, and we    \nfully implemented our elimination of overdraft\nfees for our consumer banking customers,      \nsaving these customers hundreds of millions of\ndollars. Our Auto Finance and Commercial Bank \nbusinesses also delivered solid growth and    \nreturns while navigating an evolving          \ncompetitive and economic environment.         \nOperating expenses increased, driven by       \neconomic factors, growth and our continued    \ninvestments in technology and talent. Our     \noperating efficiency ratio (1)(2)improved 79  \nbasis points to 44.2% and our adjusted        \noperating efficiency ratio (1)(3)improved     \nslightly to 44.5% as revenue growth outpaced  \noperating expense growth. We increased        \nmarketing investments by $1.1 billion, or 40%,\nas we took advantage of opportunities to      \nwelcome new customers, deepen existing        \nrelationships, and grow our consumer          \nfranchises. As a result, our total efficiency \nratio (1)(2)increased 151 basis points to 56% \nand our adjusted total efficiency ratio       \n(1)(3)increased to 56.3%. EPS was $17.91,     \nprimarily driven by revenue growth and        \nstrikingly strong credit. EPS was down from   \n2021 but the second-highest level in Capital  \nOne\u2019s history and well above pre-             \npandemiclevels of total and per share         \nprofitability. We distributed significant     \ncapital to stockholders, as we completed $4.8 \nbillion in common share                       \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            79  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII\u2014Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nrepurchases and paid $954 million in common   \ndividends. After significantly outperforming  \nbanks and the broader market in 2021, Capital \nOne shares ended 2022 at $92.96, down 35.9%   \nfrom year end 2021 and below the KBW Bank     \nIndex which was down 23.7%. Valuations and    \nstock price performance for the banking       \nsector, and for large consumer lenders        \nspecifically, came under pressure in 2022,    \nprimarily due to economic uncertainty and     \nstock market volatility. In 2022, Capital One \nlaunched new products, signed new partners,   \nand continued to reimagine the customer       \nexperience. We earned a number of external    \nawards and accolades related to our products  \nand customer experiences and continued to be  \nrecognized for our high levels of customer    \nsatisfaction and advocacy. Net Promoter       \nScores, which measure how likely our customers\nare to recommend Capital One products and     \nservices, remained extremely high across all  \nof our major businesses. We continued to      \nharness the operating, risk, and customer     \nexperience benefits of our migration to the   \npublic cloud, and are realizing cost benefits \nof our full exit from data centers in 2020. We\nalso strengthened our risk and control        \nenvironment and continued to enhance          \ncybersecurity capabilities. After sustained   \ninvestment and focus across the Company, we   \nwere pleased that the OCC formally closed     \nCapital One\u2019s cyber-related consent order. In \n2022, Capital One invested heavily in         \nrecruiting, developing, and retaining talent. \nWe welcomed thousands of new associates and   \nhave maintained strong associate morale and   \nengagement. We continued our diversity and    \ninclusion efforts, including record diverse   \nrepresentation of new executive hires and     \npromotees as well as continued progress in    \ndiverse representation among campus and       \nprofessional hire pipelines. In September     \n2022, we welcomed associates back to our      \noffices in our hybrid working model and have  \nrealized recruiting, retention and            \nproductivity benefits from offering associates\nflexibility in how they balance in-officeand  \nvirtual work. We also invested in the         \ncommunity through our Capital One Impact      \nInitiative, and combined philanthropic support\nwith skills-based associate volunteerism to   \nserve and support nonprofits across our       \nfootprint.

The year-    \nendincentive consisted of a cash incentive and\na long-term incentive comprised of stock-     \nsettled RSUs and performance shares. The      \nperformance shares provide an opportunity for \nthe executive to receive from 0% to 150% of a \ntarget number of shares of the Company\u2019s      \ncommon stock based on the Company\u2019s           \nperformance over a three-year period beginning\nJanuary 1, 2023.                              \n                                              \n  N\u2026       C\u2026       C\u2026         L\u2026         T\u2026  \n           S\u2026       I\u2026         I\u2026             \n      St\u2026      Pe\u2026                            \n      Se\u2026      Sh\u2026                            \n      RS\u2026                                     \n  A\u2026                                          \n  M.       $\u2026       $\u2026    $1\u2026      $1\u2026    $\u2026  \n  Y\u2026                                          \n  N\u2026                                          \n  A.       $\u2026       $\u2026    $1\u2026      $1\u2026    $\u2026  \n  B\u2026                                          \n  F\u2026                                          \n  G.       $\u2026       $\u2026    $1\u2026      $2\u2026    $\u2026  \n  L\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  S\u2026       $\u2026       $\u2026    $1\u2026      $1\u2026    $\u2026  \n  Y\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Mr.\u00a0Blinde\u2019s total compensation was    \n  (1)  prorated for 2022 as he commenced      \n       employment on January\u00a024, 2022.        \n                                              \nConsideration of Stockholder Feedback and 2022\nSay on Pay Vote The Committee and the Board   \nvalue the input of our stockholders and strive\nto foster a constructive dialogue with        \nstockholders on matters of executive          \ncompensation and corporate governance. At our \n2022 Annual Stockholder Meeting, 94% of our   \nstockholders supported our executive          \ncompensation program by approving our non-    \nbindingadvisory vote on executive compensation\n(\u201c2022 Say on Pay Vote\u201d). Though the Committee\nrecognized the 2022 Say on Pay Vote reflected \nstrong support for the Company\u2019s executive    \ncompensation programs, the Committee remains  \ncommitted to stockholder engagement. In 2022, \nwe continued to strengthen our outreach to    \nstockholders to maintain strong lines of      \ncommunication with our stockholders and shared\nstockholders\u2019 perspectives with the Committee \nand the Board. In 2022, management directly   \nengaged with stockholders representing        \napproximately 72% of our outstanding shares in\nover 190 interactions with investors. See     \n\u201cStockholder Engagement Program\u201d beginning on \npage 37 for more information. From this       \noutreach, the Committee and the Board gained  \nvaluable insight into our investors\u2019 views    \nabout the Company, including our executive    \ncompensation programs. The Committee and the  \nIndependent Directors considered these views  \nand feedback in approving year-endincentive   \nawards for 2022 and structuring and approving \nthe 2023 compensation programs for the NEOs.  \nIn recent years, as a result of the feedback  \nreceived from investors, the Committee made   \nthe following enhancements to our executive   \ncompensation programs and disclosure:         \n                                              \n       Linked a Portion of CEO Compensation   \n       Directly to Relative TSR.              \n       Stockholders have expressed that TSR   \n       is an important element of Company     \n       performance and asked that the         \n       Company consider a more direct link    \n       between CEO compensation and the       \n       Company\u2019s TSR over time. Beginning     \n  \u220e    with the 2020 performance year, the    \n       Committee and the Independent          \n       Directors determined to award a        \n       portion of the CEO\u2019s year-end          \n       incentive in the form of a             \n       performance share award that vests     \n       entirely based on the Company\u2019s TSR    \n       over a three-year performance period   \n       relative to the Performance Share      \n       Peers.                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Disclosure of Performance Share        \n       Awards Realized Compensation.          \n       Stockholders have expressed a desire   \n       for clearer information regarding the  \n       realized pay associated with the       \n       performance share awards granted to    \n       the NEOs. We added disclosure          \n  \u220e    regarding the settlement value         \n       resulting from the performance share   \n       awards that vested during the          \n       performance year based on the          \n       Company\u2019s performance for the          \n       associated three-year performance      \n       period.

                                  \n                                              \nCompensation Program Objectives Capital One\u2019s \nexecutive compensation program has four       \nprimary objectives. Strongly link pay and     \nperformance by providing compensation based on\nboth business and individual performance while\nappropriately balancing risk Capital One      \nemphasizes pay-for-performanceat all          \norganizational levels. Typically, as an       \nexecutive\u2019s level of responsibility increases,\nso does the proportion of the executive\u2019s pay \nthat is subject to performance criteria.      \nTherefore, the NEOs have the highest          \nproportion of their pay directly linked to    \nCompany and individual performance, as        \ncompared to other associates. Awards made to  \nthe NEOs in January 2023 for the 2022         \nperformance year were based on Company and    \nindividual performance, and on demonstrating  \nspecific leadership competencies assessed     \nthrough a comprehensive performance management\nprocess that included an individual assessment\nspecifically designed to evaluate the degree  \nto which the executive balanced risks inherent\nto his or her role. The Chief Risk Officer    \ncompiled these risk assessments and the Chief \nHuman Resources Officer reviewed the          \nassessments for the NEOs. Separately, the     \nChief Audit Officer compiled and reviewed the \nrisk assessment for the Chief Risk Officer.   \nThe Committee considered the assessments in   \nmaking its determinations regarding individual\nperformance and compensation levels. Align our\nexecutives\u2019 interests with those of our       \nstockholders The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors are committed to designing incentive\ncompensation programs that reward individual  \nand Company performance and that are aligned  \nwith the creation of stockholder value over   \nthe long term. A portion of the CEO\u2019s         \nperformance share award is directly linked to \nthe Company\u2019s relative TSR over a three-year  \nperiod. TSR also continues to be explicitly   \nincluded in the financial and operating       \nperformance factors considered by the         \nCompensation Committee and the Independent    \nDirectors to determine NEO year-endincentive  \nawards. In addition, because NEO compensation \nis primarily delivered through deferred,      \nequity-based vehicles that vest over multiple \ntime horizons, the NEOs have a significant    \nstake in the success of the Company. The      \nCommittee and the Independent Directors also  \nhave the flexibility to adjust compensation   \ndecisions from year to year to take into      \naccount the Company\u2019s performance and evolving\nmarket practices. In addition, we have        \nestablished specific stock ownership policies \nthat the NEOs must meet and stock retention   \nprovisions applicable to certain equity       \nawards. Reward performance over multiple time \nhorizons Our compensation programs are        \nstructured to encourage our executives to     \ndeliver strong results over the short- term   \nwhile making decisions that create sustained  \nvalue for our stockholders over the long-term.\nFor 2022, approximately 84% of the CEO\u2019s total\ncompensation was equity-based and at-riskto   \nthe performance of the Company\u2019s stock price, \nand 100% of his year-endincentive compensation\nwas deferred for a three-year period. In      \naddition, approximately 51% of total          \ncompensation for NEOs other than the CEO was  \nprovided through equity-based vehicles which  \nwere at-riskto the performance of the         \nCompany\u2019s stock price and subject to vesting  \nover multiple time horizons. The use of       \ndeferred, equity-based compensation vehicles  \nwith multi-year vesting terms advances our    \ngoal of aligning the ultimate value realized  \nby the NEOs with the performance of the       \nCompany\u2019s stock over time because the value of\nthese compensation vehicles increases and     \ndecreases based on the performance of the     \nCompany\u2019s stock price in both current and     \nfuture periods. Attract, retain, and motivate \ntop executive talent To attract, retain, and  \nmotivate exceptional leaders, we believe that \ncompensation opportunities at Capital One must\nbe competitive with the marketplace for       \ntalent. The Committee and the Independent     \nDirectors strive to preserve a competitive pay\nmix and total target compensation values in   \nthe executive compensation program, as well as\nprovide competitive total rewards based on our\nselected peer group. See \u201cPeer Groups\u201d        \nbeginning on page 115 for information         \nregarding how the Committee and the           \nIndependent Directors utilized the Company\u2019s  \npeer group in determining executive           \ncompensation. Use of Judgment The Committee   \nbelieves that exercising judgment is an       \nimportant element in reaching balanced        \ncompensation decisions that are consistent    \nwith our strategy, risk management, and reward\nboth current-year performance and             \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            89  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII - Compensation Discussion and  \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nsustained long-term value creation, and       \nsupplements other aspects of Capital One\u2019s    \npay-for-performancephilosophy. By applying    \ninformed judgment, the Committee seeks to     \nmitigate the risks associated with a rigid and\nstrictly formulaic compensation program, which\ncould unintentionally create incentives for   \nour executives to focus only on certain       \nperformance metrics, encourage imprudent risk-\ntaking, and not provide the best long-term    \nresults for stockholders. In addition, the use\nof judgment allows the Committee to respond to\nchanges in economic conditions, our operating \nenvironment, and other significant factors    \nthat may affect the long-term performance of  \nCapital One or our lines of business. The use \nof judgment also allows the Committee to      \nadjust compensation based on factors that     \nwould not be appropriately reflected by a     \nstrictly formulaic approach, such as risk     \nmanagement, championing Company values, and   \nthe discrepancies between absolute and        \nrelative performance levels or recognition of \nindividual performance levels. There are      \ncertain performance conditions for which the  \nCommittee would not exercise judgment, for    \nexample, where the minimum performance metric \nis not met in the award of performance shares \nor if the performance-based vesting           \nrequirements applicable to certain other      \nstock-settled awards are not met. Our         \nCompensation Governance Cycle The Committee is\nactively engaged throughout the year, and     \nmembers of the Committee regularly meet with  \nmanagement, regarding the Company\u2019s executive \ncompensation programs and practices. In       \naddition, the Committee and the Board receive \nregular updates regarding the Company\u2019s       \nfinancial and strategic performance, including\ninformation regarding the Company\u2019s           \nperformance against the four categories of    \nquantitative and qualitative performance      \nfactors related to: financial and operating   \nperformance, governance and risk management,  \nstrategic performance, and winning with our   \ncustomers and associates (the \u201cPerformance    \nFactors\u201d) that are used by the Committee to   \ndetermine the year-endincentive awards to the \nNEOs. The Committee met three times in 2022,  \nwith each meeting concluding with an executive\nsession without management present. In        \naddition, the Committee held four joint       \nmeetings with the Board in 2022, and an       \nadditional joint meeting was held at the      \nbeginning of 2023 to assess Company and NEO   \nperformance and determine the year-           \nendincentive awards for the NEOs.

The Committee considers\nthe Company\u2019s and the CEO\u2019s historical        \nperformance and seeks to effectively align the\nCEO\u2019s interests with the interests of our     \nstockholders over time, support safety and    \nsoundness, and appropriately balance risk.    \n2022 CEO Compensation Program When determining\nthe structure of Mr. Fairbank\u2019s compensation  \nprogram for the 2022 performance year, the    \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nconsidered:                                   \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s performance during the   \n  \u220e    prior year and Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u2019s          \n       contribution to that performance;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s performance in the       \n  \u220e    prior year relative to the             \n       performance of peer comparator         \n       companies in that year;                \n                                              \n                                              \n       the structure and amount of            \n  \u220e    compensation awarded to the CEOs of    \n       the Company\u2019s peers;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       the structure and amount of Mr.\u00a0       \n  \u220e    Fairbank\u2019s compensation awards in      \n       prior years;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s risk profile and the     \n  \u220e    time horizon over which the deferred,  \n       equity-based awards will vest;         \n                                              \n                                              \n       the ultimate value of Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u2019s   \n       deferred, equity-based awards (which   \n       will depend on the Company\u2019s and Mr.\u00a0  \n  \u220e    Fairbank\u2019s performance over time as    \n       well as the value of Capital One       \n       common stock at the time the awards    \n       vest); and                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       the feedback received from             \n       stockholders regarding the Company\u2019s   \n  \u220e    executive compensation programs and    \n       the compensation awarded to Mr.        \n       Fairbank.                              \n                                              \nAfter considering these factors, in February  \n2022, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors determined that Mr. Fairbank\u2019s 2022 \ncompensation program would continue to consist\nof two components: (i) an equity or equity-   \nbased award granted at the beginning of the   \nperformance year; and (ii) an opportunity for \na year-endincentive award, with the amount    \ngranted based on CEO and Company performance  \nin 2022 (granted in January 2023). Any year-  \nendincentive award granted to the CEO (i)     \nwould continue to consist primarily of a      \nperformance share award, under which he may   \nreceive 0% to 150% of a target number of      \nshares of Capital One common stock based on   \nthe Company\u2019s performance over a three-year   \nperiod; and (ii) may also consist of deferred \ncash, an equity-based award, or both. In this \nmanner, the CEO\u2019s compensation will continue  \nto be completely at-riskbased on the Company\u2019s\nand Mr. Fairbank\u2019s performance, and all CEO   \ncompensation continues to be subject to a     \nthree-year deferred vesting or payout. As in  \nprior years, Mr. Fairbank did not receive any \ncash salary in 2022. The Committee and the    \nIndependent Directors determined not to       \nestablish a total target compensation amount  \nfor Mr. Fairbank\u2019s 2022 compensation program  \nto further align Mr. Fairbank\u2019s compensation  \nprogram with that of the Company\u2019s peers and  \nincrease the Committee and the Independent    \nDirectors\u2019 ability to directly link the CEO\u2019s \ncompensation to the Company\u2019s performance as  \nwell as the CEO\u2019s contributions to that       \nperformance over the short-, medium-, and     \nlong-term.                                    \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            91  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII - Compensation Discussion and  \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n2022 CEO Compensation Components The chart    \nbelow represents the components and pay mix of\nthe CEO\u2019s compensation for the 2022           \nperformance year. For performance year 2022,  \nthe year-endincentive was delivered in the    \nform of performance shares, deferred cash, and\ncash-settled RSUs, representing 63%, 16%, and \n11%, respectively, of the CEO\u2019s total         \nperformance year compensation.

Restricted Stock Units A portion of Mr. \nFairbank\u2019s 2022 compensation consisted of RSUs\ngranted as an incentive for long-term Company \nperformance. The RSU award has a three-year   \ncliff-vesting schedule and vests in full at   \nthe end of a three-year performance period    \nbeginning on January 1, 2022, settles in cash \nbased on the Company\u2019s average stock price    \nover the 15 trading days preceding the vesting\ndate, and is subject to performance-based     \nvesting provisions and clawback provisions,   \neach as described in more detail under        \n\u201cAdditional Performance Conditions and        \nRecovery Provisions\u201d beginning on page 111.   \nYear-EndIncentive Opportunity A portion of Mr.\nFairbank\u2019s 2022 compensation consisted of an  \nopportunity for a year-endincentive based on  \nthe Committee\u2019s evaluation of the Company\u2019s   \nperformance during 2022 and Mr. Fairbank\u2019s    \ncontributions to that performance. For        \npurposes of the year-endincentive, the        \nCommittee and the Independent Directors assess\nthe Company\u2019s performance based on the        \nPerformance Factors. The Committee believes   \nthat these factors appropriately reflect and  \nbalance near-term performance and long-term   \nsuccess for the Company\u2019s customers,          \nassociates, and stockholders. The Company\u2019s   \n2022 performance against the Performance      \nFactors is described in more detailed under   \n\u201c2022 Year-EndIncentive Determination\u201d        \nbeginning on page 97. The year-endincentive,  \nif awarded, (i) will consist of an award of   \nperformance shares, and (ii) may also consist \nof deferred cash, an equity-based award, or   \nboth as determined by the Committee and the   \nIndependent Directors at the time the award is\ngranted. The performance share awards, the    \nequity-based award, and the deferred cash     \nbonus each have a three-year cliff-vesting    \nschedule and vest in full at the end of a     \nthree-year performance period beginning on    \nJanuary 1, 2023. The equity-based awards are  \nsubject to performance-based vesting          \nprovisions and all three awards are subject to\nclawback provisions each as described in more \ndetail under \u201cAdditional Performance          \nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning \non page 111. Performance Share Awards The     \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve the performance shares strengthen the \nalignment between the compensation of our NEOs\nand the Company\u2019s performance by linking the  \nultimate payout to pre-establishedabsolute    \nand/or relative performance goals, with the   \nvalue of the payout ranging from 0% to 150%.  \nThe ultimate value of the performance shares  \nupon vesting is determined by the Company\u2019s   \nperformance through its stock price. The CEO  \nyear-endincentive award consists primarily of \nperformance shares. For the other NEOs, the   \nperformance share awards represent            \napproximately 30% of total target             \ncompensation. For 2022, the performance share \nawards were granted in two forms:             \n                                              \n       Financial Performance Share Units      \n       (\u201cFinancial Performance Shares\u201d) that  \n       vest based on the Company\u2019s financial  \n       performance, on an absolute basis and  \n       relative to the Performance Share      \n       Peers, related to a combination of     \n       two metrics: Common Dividends plus     \n       Growth of Tangible Book Value per      \n       share (\u201cD+TBV\u201d) and Adjusted Return    \n       on Tangible Common Equity (\u201cAdjusted   \n       ROTCE\u201d) over a three-year period.

TSR is   \nviewed by investors as a key indicator of the \nCompany\u2019s performance. The TSR Performance    \nShares create a direct link between CEO       \ncompensation and the Company\u2019s stock price and\nvalue creation over time. In addition, a      \nsignificant portion of CEO pay is delivered   \nthrough equity-based awards, the ultimate     \nvalue of which will increase or decrease based\non the performance of the Company\u2019s stock     \nprice in both current and future periods.     \nPerformance Share Award Peer Group. For both  \nthe Financial Performance Shares and the TSR  \nPerformance Shares, the Company\u2019s performance \non each metric is assessed over the three-year\nperiod relative to the Performance Share Peers\nwhich consists of the KBW Bank Index,         \nexcluding five non-traditionalbanks that do   \nnot focus on lending to consumers and         \nbusinesses (\u201cKBW Index\u201d). The Committee       \nbelieves that the KBW Index is an appropriate \nindex against which to assess the Company\u2019s   \nperformance because it reflects institutions  \nof a comparable size, risk profile, and       \nbusiness mix to the Company. After the end of \nthe three-year performance period, the        \nCommittee will certify the Company\u2019s          \nperformance and issue the corresponding number\nof shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, if   \nany, in accordance with the relative          \nperformance hurdles illustrated below.        \nPerformance Share Award Formula. For all      \nperformance share awards, the ultimate number \nof performance shares earned at vesting is    \ndetermined by a formula based on relative     \nperformance and/or absolute performance (in   \nthe form of a performance share reduction)    \nmeasures, with the value of the payout ranging\nfrom 0% to 150% of the target performance     \nshares. In addition, the value of the         \nperformance shares upon vesting is determined \nby the Company\u2019s stock price performance. All \nperformance share awards are subject to the   \nRelative Performance Measure (as described    \nbelow). Only the Financial Performance Shares \nare subject to the Absolute Performance       \nMeasure (as described below). The award       \nagreements applicable to all performance share\nawards permit the Committee to exclude the    \ninitial effects of changes in tax laws,       \naccounting principles or regulations, or other\nlaws or provisions affecting the reported     \nresults if the Committee determines that such \nadjustments are appropriate in order to       \nprevent dilution or enlargement of the        \nbenefits or potential benefits intended to be \nmade available under the 2004 Stock Incentive \nPlan or necessary or appropriate to comply    \nwith applicable laws, rules, or regulations.  \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            95  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII - Compensation Discussion and  \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nRelative Performance Measure - Financial      \nPerformance Shares and TSR Performance Shares.\nEach year, the Committee and the Independent  \nDirectors assess the Company\u2019s performance on \nthe basis of the performance share award      \nmetrics relative to the Performance Share     \nPeers. The Company\u2019s TSR or positive Adjusted \nROTCE and D+TBV, as applicable, must be at    \nleast at the 25th percentile of the           \nPerformance Share Peers for any performance   \nshares to vest; target payout will be achieved\nat the 55th percentile of the Performance     \nShare Peers; and the maximum payout can only  \nbe achieved if the Company performs at the    \n80th percentile of the Performance Share Peers\nor greater. If the Company\u2019s TSR or Adjusted  \nROTCE and D+TBV, as applicable, is under the  \n25th percentile, none of the shares will vest \nand no payout will be made with respect to the\naward. After the end of the three-year        \nperformance period, the Committee will certify\nthe Company\u2019s performance and issue the       \ncorresponding number of shares of the         \nCompany\u2019s common stock, if any, in accordance \nwith the graph below. Payouts will range      \nbetween the values shown below for performance\nthat falls between the points labeled in the  \ngraph. Absolute Performance Measure           \n(Performance Share Reduction) \u2014 Financial     \nPerformance Shares. The Financial Performance \nShares are subject to a performance share     \nreduction feature under which the number of   \nshares issued at settlement will be reduced if\nthe Company\u2019s Adjusted ROTCE for one or more  \nfiscal years completed during the performance \nperiod is not positive, no matter how well the\nCompany performs compared to the Performance  \nShare Peers. In each year that the Company    \ndoes not achieve positive Adjusted ROTCE, the \nexecutive will forfeit 50% of that year\u2019s     \nworth of performance shares. If the Company\u2019s \nAdjusted ROTCE is not positive in each of the \nthree fiscal years in the performance period, \nthe executive will forfeit the entire award of\nperformance shares.

The  \nRSUs are subject to performance-based vesting \nand clawback provisions, each as described in \nmore detail under \u201cAdditional Performance     \nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning \non page 111.

The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve that this pay-for-                    \nperformancestructure, which emphasizes        \nvariable pay, incentivizes the CEO to invest  \nfor the long-term, grow resiliently, manage   \nrisk, and deliver sustained stockholder value.\nIn addition, the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors believe this approach is in the best\ninterests of the stockholders and provides the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors a     \ngreater opportunity to determine the amount   \nand form of compensation based on CEO and     \nCompany performance and stockholder feedback  \nas well as being able to respond to then-     \ncurrent business conditions, the dynamic      \nnature of executive compensation practices,   \nand developments in our business and industry.\n2022 RSU Award In February 2022, the Committee\nand the Independent Directors awarded Mr.     \nFairbank 16,859 RSUs, which had a total grant \ndate value of approximately $2.50 million. The\nRSU award vests in full on February 15, 2025, \nsettles in cash based on the Company\u2019s average\nstock price over the 15 trading days preceding\nthe vesting date, and is subject to           \nperformance-based vesting provisions and      \nclawback provisions, each as described in more\ndetail under \u201cAdditional Performance          \nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning \non page 111. 2022 Year-EndIncentive           \nDetermination Compensation Committee Process  \nto Determine Year-EndIncentive In January     \n2023, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors assessed the Company\u2019s performance  \nwith respect to the Performance Factors set   \nforth below under \u201cCompany Performance        \nAssessment\u201d and Mr. Fairbank\u2019s contributions  \nto that performance as described under \u201cCEO   \nContribution to Company Performance.\u201d         \nFollowing the performance assessment, the     \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \ndetermined the total 2022 performance year    \ncompensation to be awarded to Mr. Fairbank    \nwould be approximately $26.13 million, taking \ninto account the $2.50 million in RSUs awarded\nto him at the beginning of the performance    \nyear.

In addition, the full value of the     \nFinancial Performance Share award remains at  \nrisk unless a threshold level of Company      \nperformance is achieved.

Independent     \nDirectors also assessed Mr. Fairbank\u2019s        \ncontributions to the Company\u2019s 2022           \nperformance. Under Mr. Fairbank\u2019s leadership, \nCapital One delivered very strong financial   \nand operating results, resilient account and  \nloan growth, and strong stewardship of        \nstockholder capital. The Company was prepared \nfor, and proactively adapted to, volatile     \nmarket and economic conditions while          \ncontinuing to advance Capital One\u2019s long-term \ngoals and business strategies. In 2022,       \nCapital One achieved double-digit revenue     \ngrowth, its highest organic revenue growth    \nrate in two decades. Strong revenue growth    \ncoupled with strikingly strong credit drove   \nthe second-highest level of earnings per share\nin Capital One\u2019s history. The Company         \nbolstered its already-strong balance sheet and\nreturned significant capital to common        \nstockholders through common dividends and     \nshare repurchases while continuing to invest  \nin capabilities like talent, technology and   \nlong-term growth. Capital One maintained      \nstrong market positions, drove resilient      \ngrowth and returns in each key line of        \nbusiness, and maintained high customer        \nadvocacy scores. Our Card business delivered  \nstrong loan growth and record purchase volume \nas it capitalized on the benefits of new      \nproducts, compelling rewards, strong brand    \nadvocacy and a technology-driven customer and \ndigital experience. Our Commercial Banking    \nbusiness also delivered strong loan growth and\nsolid returns. In our Consumer Banking        \nbusiness, we achieved solid earnings, strong  \ndeposit volumes, and resilient auto loan      \noriginations. For our consumer deposit        \ncustomers, we implemented the complete        \nelimination of consumer overdraft fees and    \nfree access to overdraft protection. Mr.      \nFairbank\u2019s visionary leadership led the       \nCompany through a challenging and uncertain   \neconomic and competitive environment in 2022  \nwhile delivering very strong financial results\nand continuing to make strategic investments  \nto attract talent, transform our technology,  \nand grow our franchise. Capital One recruited \nskilled, experienced and diverse talent;      \nmaintained high associate engagement and      \nmorale scores as measured in our regular      \nenterprise-wide surveys; and was recognized   \nexternally for being an exceptional place to  \nlaunch or grow your career. The Company       \ncontinued to be recognized as a technology and\ndigital leader. Mr. Fairbank maintained a keen\nfocus on building and sustaining strong risk  \nmanagement practices and controls and         \nembedding resilience into both our operations \nand financial choices. He continued to model  \nand reinforce the Company\u2019s culture, values   \nand mission with associates, recruits,        \npartners, suppliers, and investors. The       \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nrecognize that the Company\u2019s one-yearTSR      \nunderperformed the broader market and the     \nCompany\u2019s peer comparator group in 2022. After\nsignificantly outperforming the broader stock \nmarket during the earlier stages of the       \npandemic, in 2022 Capital One shares fell more\nthan market and industry peers. Growing       \neconomic uncertainty and its possible effect  \non future credit performance and profitability\nhad a significant negative impact on bank     \nstock prices and on large consumer lending    \ncompanies in particular, including Capital    \nOne. Despite these near-term valuation        \npressures, Mr. Fairbank continued to focus on \nthe long-term while balancing the level and   \npace of investments. Mr. Fairbank has         \ncontinued to prioritize resilient growth,     \nbuilding long-term capabilities, and          \nmaintaining the enterprise\u2019s focus on strong  \nthrough-cycle risk management and operational \nefficiency. The Committee and the Independent \nDirectors believe that the Company\u2019s tactical \nand strategic choices over the past twelve    \nmonths will result in strong stockholder      \nreturns over time through continued top-      \nlinegrowth, improved efficiency, sound credit \nand operational risk management, strong       \nprofitability, and significant capital        \ndistribution. The Committee and the           \nIndependent Directors also took into account  \nMr. Fairbank\u2019s unique role as the founder of  \nCapital One, as well as peer group CEO        \ncompensation levels and structure, the tenures\nof peer companies\u2019 CEOs, and the varying      \ndegrees of success those CEOs have had in     \nleading their respective companies in 2022 and\nover time. The Committee and the Independent  \nDirectors recognized that Mr. Fairbank does   \nnot receive a cash salary, and 100% of his    \ncompensation is deferred for at least three   \nyears. The Committee and the Independent      \nDirectors believe that the actions taken by   \nMr. Fairbank and the other NEOs throughout    \n2022 drove very strong financial and operating\nresults and continued the momentum of the     \nCompany toward the achievement of its long-   \nterm strategic objectives. These actions and  \nchoices have positioned the Company to deliver\nstrong and sustainable financial performance, \nmaintain resilience, and create enduring value\nto stockholders over the long-term.           \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  102    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII - Compensation Discussion and  \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nCEO Compensation by Performance Year Below is \na table showing Mr. Fairbank\u2019s compensation   \nawards as they are attributable to the        \nperformance years indicated.

This table differs\nsubstantially from the Summary Compensation   \nTable beginning on page 120 and is therefore  \nnot a substitute for the information required \nin that table. There are two principal        \ndifferences between the Summary Compensation  \nTable and the table above:                    \n                                              \n       The table above reports equity-based   \n       awards as compensation for the         \n       performance year for which they were   \n       awarded, even if the award was         \n       granted in one year based on           \n       performance for the prior year.

Additional details on these     \nprograms can be found in the \u201cNamed Executive \nOfficer Compensation\u201d section beginning on    \npage 120. 2023 CEO Compensation Program Each  \nyear, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors perform a comprehensive review of   \nthe CEO compensation program in consideration \nof Company and CEO performance, peer          \ncomparator group performance, historical pay  \ninformation, market practices and trends, the \nmarket for talent, stockholder and other      \nstakeholder feedback, and other relevant      \npoints of information that the Committee and  \nthe Independent Directors consider appropriate\nto assess the program and CEO compensation    \nlevel and pay design. The Committee and the   \nIndependent Directors continue to believe that\nthe CEO compensation program aligns Mr.       \nFairbank\u2019s compensation with the Company\u2019s    \nperformance over the appropriate time         \nhorizons, effectively balances risk, and      \nsupports the Company\u2019s executive compensation \ngoals and principles. In January 2023, the    \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nreviewed the 2022 compensation structure      \nutilized for Mr. Fairbank and determined that,\nfor 2023, the CEO compensation program would  \nbe unchanged and continue to consist of two   \ncomponents:                                   \n                                              \n       An Equity or Equity-Based Award.

Mr.\u00a0Fairbank does not      \n       receive a cash base salary.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       A Year-End Incentive Opportunity. Mr.  \n       Fairbank will have an opportunity for  \n       a year-end incentive award, with the   \n       amount granted based on CEO and        \n       Company performance in 2023. Any       \n       year-end incentive award granted to    \n       the CEO (i)\u00a0will continue to consist   \n       primarily of performance share         \n       awards, including an award of TSR      \n       Performance Shares and Financial       \n       Performance Shares, under which he     \n       may receive 0% to 150% of a target     \n       number of shares of Capital One        \n       common stock based on the Company\u2019s    \n       financial performance and TSR over a   \n       three-year period; and (ii)\u00a0may also   \n       consist of deferred cash, an           \n  \u220e    equity-based award, or both.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nIn this manner, the CEO\u2019s compensation will   \ncontinue to be completely at-riskbased on the \nCompany\u2019s and Mr. Fairbank\u2019s performance, and \nall CEO compensation continues to be subject  \nto a three-year deferred vesting or payout. As\nin prior years, Mr. Fairbank will not receive \nany cash salary in 2023. Any deferred cash or \nequity-based award will pay out or vest after \na three-year deferral period. The Committee   \nand the Independent Directors will use their  \njudgment to determine whether to make the     \nyear-endincentive award, the form of the award\nand the value of the award.

The Committee takes into  \naccount each NEO\u2019s historical performance,    \nindividual roles and responsibilities,        \ncontributions expected from each NEO in the   \nfuture as well as the recommendations of the  \nCEO, including his assessment of each NEO\u2019s   \nperformance. In February 2022, the Committee  \nand the Independent Directors approved the    \n2022 compensation program, which is designed  \nto be consistent with the Company\u2019s pay-for-  \nperformancephilosophy. Based on market        \npractices and trends, a review of peer        \ncomparator information and in response to     \nstockholder feedback, NEO total target        \ncompensation is composed of 20% base salary,  \n25% cash incentive opportunity, and 55% long- \nterm incentive opportunity, which will consist\nof performance shares and stock-settled RSUs  \nas determined by the Committee. The Committee \nbelieves that this pay mix balances           \nstockholder interests while effectively       \nrewarding and motivating key talent. For the  \n2022 performance year, the NEOs received a mix\nof approximately 49% cash and 51% equity-based\ncompensation as follows: cash salary,         \ndetermined at the beginning of the performance\nyear; and a cash incentive and long-term      \nincentive awards, determined following the end\nof the performance year based on the          \nCommittee\u2019s evaluation of Company and         \nindividual performance during the past year.  \nThe long-term incentive awards granted for the\n2022 performance year consisted of performance\nshares (approximately 28% of total awarded    \ncompensation) and stock-settled RSUs          \n(generally 23% of total awarded compensation).\nAll of the equity awards vest over a three-   \nyear period. The terms of the performance     \nshare awards are substantially similar to the \nterms of the Financial Performance Share      \nawards granted to our CEO in 2022, as         \ndescribed earlier under \u201cPerformance Share    \nAwards\u201d beginning on page 93. The table below \nsummarizes the NEO compensation program that  \nthe Committee and the Independent Directors   \napproved for the 2022 performance year. The   \ntotal target compensation of the NEOs for the \n2022 performance year was composed of base    \nsalary awarded at the beginning of the        \nperformance year and a year-endincentive      \nopportunity that, if granted, may consist of  \nequity awards in the form of performance      \nshares and/or RSUs, and a cash incentive. The \nchart below shows the 2022 components of NEO  \ncompensation as an approximate percentage of  \nNEO total target compensation:                \n                                              \n

Directors approved 2022 cash base \nsalaries for the NEOs ranging from $940,692 to\n$1,292,154, which include subsequent          \nadjustments made as a result of an enterprise-\nwide compensation review. Individual details  \nfor each NEO are provided in the table below  \nshowing compensation by performance year.     \nYear-EndIncentive Awards A portion of the     \nNEOs\u2019 2022 compensation consisted of an       \nopportunity for a year-endincentive award     \nbased on Company and the NEO\u2019s individual     \nperformance in 2022. This award, if granted,  \nmay consist of long-term incentive awards in  \nthe form of performance shares and/or RSUs,   \nand a cash incentive award. In January 2023,  \nthe Committee and the Independent Directors   \ndetermined to award each NEO performance      \nshares, a cash incentive award, and RSUs as   \nrecognition of Company and NEO individual     \nperformance in 2022. Cash Incentive Awards The\ncash incentive awards provided to the NEOs are\nbased on the Committee\u2019s evaluation of the    \nCompany\u2019s performance during 2022. In February\n2022, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors established a target value for the  \ncash incentive for each NEO consisting of     \napproximately 25% of the NEOs\u2019 total target   \ncompensation. The Committee and the           \nIndependent Directors may determine to award  \n0% to 150% of the cash incentive target value \nbased on Company performance. For purposes of \nthe cash incentive awards, the Committee and  \nthe Independent Directors assess the Company\u2019s\nperformance based on the Performance Factors. \nThe Committee believes that these factors     \nappropriately reflect and balance near-term   \nperformance and long-term success for the     \nCompany\u2019s customers, associates, and          \nstockholders. See \u201c2022 CEO Compensation      \nProgram and Components\u201d beginning on page 91  \nfor details regarding the Performance Factors.\nIn January 2023, the Committee and the        \nIndependent Directors approved cash incentive \nawards for the NEOs ranging from approximately\n$1.66 million to $2.29 million, representing a\npayout at 140% of the target award values     \nestablished by the Committee in February 2022,\nbased on actual Company performance in 2022.  \nIndividual details for each NEO are provided  \nin the table below showing compensation by    \nperformance year. The assessment of Company   \nperformance for the NEOs is consistent with   \nthe assessment performed in connection with   \nthe CEO year-endincentive award. The Committee\nand the Independent Directors determined that \nthese awards were appropriate in light of the \nCompany\u2019s performance as described under      \n\u201cYear-EndIncentive Opportunity\u201d beginning on  \npage 93 in connection with the determinations \nby the Committee and the Independent Directors\nrelating to the CEO\u2019s year-endincentive       \nawards. Long-Term Incentive Awards Long-term  \nincentive awards are designed to reward       \nindividual performance and align a significant\nportion of compensation with achievement of   \nboth annual and long-term performance goals.  \nIn determining the actual amounts to be       \nawarded to each NEO, the Committee considered \neach NEO\u2019s contribution to the Company\u2019s      \nperformance for 2022, as well as the          \nindividual performance of each NEO. The       \nCommittee also received input from the CEO on \nhis assessment of each NEO\u2019s individual       \nperformance and his recommendations for       \ncompensation of the NEOs. The CEO also        \nassessed the degree to which the NEO balanced \nrisks inherent in the NEO\u2019s role. These       \nassessments included the use of both          \nquantitative and qualitative risk measures and\nwere compiled by the Chief Risk Officer and   \nreviewed by the Chief Human Resources Officer,\nand separately the Chief Audit Officer        \ncompiled and reviewed the assessment for the  \nChief Risk Officer, before such assessments   \nwere presented to the Committee and the       \nIndependent Directors for their consideration.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  108    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII\u2014Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nIn January 2023, the Committee and the        \nIndependent Directors granted long-term       \nincentive awards, consisting of stock-settled \nRSUs and performance shares, to the NEOs, as  \nrecognition for individual NEO performance in \n2022 and to drive further long-term           \nperformance.

Additional details on these     \nprograms can be found in the \u201cNamed Executive \nOfficer Compensation\u201d section beginning on    \npage 120. 2023 NEO Compensation Program Each  \nyear, the Committee reviews the NEO           \ncompensation program in light of Company      \nperformance data, peer comparator group       \nperformance data, historical pay information, \ndata on specific market practices and trends, \nstockholder feedback, and other relevant      \npoints of information. The program consists of\nmultiple compensation vehicles that directly  \nlink the NEOs\u2019 compensation with the Company\u2019s\nperformance over multiple time horizons, align\nthe NEOs\u2019 interests with the interests of the \nCompany\u2019s stockholders, support safety and    \nsoundness, and encourage appropriate risk-    \ntaking. In January 2023, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors approved the 2023       \ncompensation program for our NEOs, which is   \nsubstantially similar to the 2022 program.    \nAdditional Performance Conditions and Recovery\nProvisions The awards granted to our NEOs     \ninclude the following provisions that are     \ndesigned to further enhance alignment between \npay and performance and balance the risks that\nour incentive compensation programs might     \notherwise encourage:                          \n                                             \n  \u220e    Performance-based vesting provisions  \n                                             \n                                    \n  \u220e    Performance share reduction  \n                                    \n                                       \n  \u220e    Misconduct clawback provisions  \n                                       \n                                        \n  \u220e    Financial restatement clawbacks  \n                                        \nThese terms and conditions apply to certain   \nincentive awards granted to every executive   \nofficer and not just to the NEOs.             \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           111  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII\u2014Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nPerformance-Based Vesting Provisions          \n                                              \n                         We include           \n                         performance-based    \n                         vesting provisions   \n                         in each award of     \n                         stock options, if    \n                         any, and             \n                         stock-settled RSUs   \n                         granted to NEOs and  \n                         each award of        \n                         cash-settled RSUs    \n                         granted to the CEO.  \n                         These provisions     \n                         will reduce the      \n                         total value          \n  Performance- Based\u00a0    delivered to the     \n  Vesting Provisions     executive at         \n                         vesting if the       \n                         Company does not     \n                         meet certain         \n                         performance          \n                         thresholds during    \n                         the three-year       \n                         vesting period. The  \n                         total value can be   \n                         reduced to zero if   \n                         the performance      \n                         threshold is not     \n                         met in any of the    \n                         three years in the   \n                         performance period.  \n                                              \nThe ultimate value that our NEOs receive from \nequity-based incentive awards is tied to our  \nstock price performance over the vesting      \nperiod. In addition, the Committee            \nnevertheless determined that these awards     \nshould be subject to additional performance   \nconditions so that the value received by the  \nexecutives is also conditioned upon the       \nCompany continuing to meet certain operating  \nperformance thresholds for each and every     \nfiscal year ending in the three-year vesting  \nperiod. Any forfeitures will be cumulative    \nover the three-year vesting period. In this   \nmanner, regardless of our executives\u2019 past    \nperformance and our stock price performance,  \nthe awards subject to performance-based       \nvesting remain at risk of complete forfeiture \nover the three-year vesting period.           \nPerformance-based vesting provisions apply to \nthe following awards:                         \n                                   \n  \u220e    All NEO stock-settled RSUs  \n                                   \n                                  \n  \u220e    All CEO cash-settled RSUs  \n                                  \nThese performance conditions do not present   \nany upside potential for the NEOs\u2019            \ncompensation but instead create an additional \nat-riskelement to the compensation that has   \nbeen awarded to them. Imposing these          \nadditional performance conditions is designed \nto further reflect our approach of balancing  \nrisk and performance over the long term. For  \nawards granted since January 2014, vesting is \nconditioned on the Company achieving positive \nCore Earnings (as defined below). If Core     \nEarnings are not positive for any fiscal year \nin the vesting period, the named executive    \nofficer will automatically forfeit 50% of one \nyear\u2019s worth of vesting (i.e., one-sixthof the\ntotal award). In addition, the Committee will \ndetermine the extent to which any named       \nexecutive officer was accountable for the     \noutcome and, based on such determination, the \nCommittee will decide whether any or all of   \nthe remaining 50% of one year\u2019s worth of      \nvesting will also be forfeited. The Committee \nmay also decide to delay the vesting of the   \napplicable portion of the award not so        \nforfeited. For the NEOs, these determinations \nwill be made each year prior to the scheduled \nvesting date, based on the Core Earnings for  \nthe fiscal year ended prior to such vesting   \ndate. For the CEO, these determinations will  \nbe made prior to the scheduled vesting date at\nthe end of the three-year vesting period,     \ntaking into account Core Earnings for each    \nfiscal year within the period. Core Earnings  \nfocuses on whether profits are being generated\nby our basic business, as opposed to other    \nfactors that may not reflect business         \nfundamentals. The applicable award agreements \ndefine \u201cCore Earnings\u201d to mean the Company\u2019s  \nnet income available to common stockholders,  \nexcluding, on a tax-adjustedbasis, the impact \nof (i) impairment or amortization of goodwill \nand intangible assets, and (ii) the build or  \nrelease of the allowance for credit losses,   \ncalculated as the difference between the      \nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs,  \nnet of recoveries. The Committee believes that\nCore Earnings is an appropriate performance   \nmetric to employ for these performance-based  \nvesting provisions because the metric captures\nmajor operational costs and risks to the      \nCompany\u2019s business, including charge-offs,    \noperating expenses, market and competitive    \nrisks, and costs to maintain adequate levels  \nof capital and liquidity. The metric is based \non net income available to common stockholders\nand it also includes the impact of            \ndiscontinued operations.                      \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  112    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII\u2014Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nPerformance Share Reduction                   \n                                              \n                         Each performance     \n                         share award granted  \n                         to the NEOs          \n                         provides that the    \n                         total value          \n                         delivered at         \n                         vesting will be      \n                         reduced if for any   \n                         year in the          \n                         three-year           \n                         performance period   \n                         the Company does     \n                         not achieve          \n  Performance Share\u00a0     positive Adjusted    \n  Reduction              ROTCE.

These reductions will \noccur regardless of how well the Company\u2019s    \nAdjusted ROTCE compares to the Performance    \nShare Peers. If the Company does not achieve  \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for one year in the   \nperformance period, the total number of shares\nissued on the vesting date will be reduced by \none-sixth.If the Company does not achieve     \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for two years in the  \nperformance period, the total number of shares\nissued on the vesting date will be reduced by \none-third.If the Company does not achieve     \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for any of the three  \nyears in the performance period, the NEOs will\nforfeit the entire award.

The Committee relies on a\nrange of objective data including Company     \nperformance data, peer comparator group       \nperformance data, historical pay information, \ndata on specific market practices and trends, \nstockholder feedback, and other relevant      \npoints of information to inform its business  \njudgment. Use of Outside Consultants for NEO  \nCompensation The Committee engages FW Cook, an\nindependent compensation consultant, to assist\nin the design of the CEO compensation program.\nFW Cook assists the Committee in a number of  \nways, including proposing and evaluating a    \npeer comparator group, gathering relevant     \ncompensation data from the peer group, and    \ndiscussing relevant market trends and context \nand developing recommendations on possible    \nplan designs. The Chief Human Resources       \nOfficer and other members of the Company\u2019s    \nHuman Resources department assist the CEO in  \ndeveloping compensation recommendations for   \nthe NEOs other than the CEO for the           \nCommittee\u2019s consideration. The Human Resources\ndepartment typically uses multiple surveys as \nsources of market compensation data. FW Cook  \nalso provides additional market reference     \npoints that the Committee and the Independent \nDirectors use when evaluating NEO             \ncompensation, and other outside consultants   \nprovide information to the Human Resources    \ndepartment regarding market practices, trends,\nand research reports. The Human Resources     \ndepartment is responsible for analyzing the   \ninformation obtained from the outside         \nconsultants and presenting it to the CEO, who \nconsiders the information and makes his       \ncompensation recommendations for the other    \nNEOs to the Committee and the Independent     \nDirectors. A consultant from FW Cook is       \npresent at Committee meetings during which CEO\nand NEO compensation is discussed and provides\nmarket data as well as an independent         \nperspective regarding CEO and NEO compensation\npractices. FW Cook has no other engagement    \nwith, and performs no other services for,     \nCapital One other than the services described \nabove.

These  \norganizations are intended to represent the   \nmarketplace of companies with which Capital   \nOne competes for business and for executive   \ntalent. The compensation data from the peer   \ngroup is used to inform the Committee\u2019s       \ndetermination of the structure and the total  \ncompensation target values of the compensation\nprogram for the NEOs other than the CEO and   \nthe total level of compensation for the CEO.  \nThe peer group is reviewed each year and      \nadjusted, as appropriate, so that the peer    \ngroup companies reflect Capital One\u2019s         \ncompetitive environment. The Committee        \nexamines pay practices and data for the peer  \ngroup companies as a source of benchmarking   \ndata to assess the competitiveness of our     \ncompensation levels and pay components. As    \npart of this analysis, a consultant from FW   \nCook presents a comprehensive report to the   \nCommittee that highlights the size, scope, and\nperformance information from the peer         \ncompanies across a variety of metrics and     \npresents recommendations for changes to the   \npeer group, as applicable.

See \u201cPerformance Share Award Peer      \nGroup\u201d on page 95 for a description and       \ndiscussion of the Performance Share Peers.    \nTally Sheets In addition to considering market\ndata from our peer comparator group (when     \navailable), the Committee also conducts an    \nannual comprehensive review of tally sheets   \nfor the CEO and each NEO which reflect all    \ncomponents of compensation and include total  \ncompensation and potential payouts. Each tally\nsheet summarizes multiple components of       \ncurrent and historical compensation. The tally\nsheets assist with the Committee\u2019s            \nunderstanding of the historical context that  \nis relevant to current compensation decisions,\nsuch as the CEO and each NEO\u2019s unrealized     \nequity value. Other Compensation Arrangements \nPension and Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation\nPlans Capital One does not have any active    \npension plans for the NEOs. In 2022, each of  \nour NEOs, except Mr. Blinde, participated in  \nCapital One\u2019s VNQDCP, which is a voluntary,   \nnon-qualifieddeferred compensation plan that  \nrestores participating NEOs, excluding the    \nCEO, to the level of savings they would have  \nachieved if they had not been impacted by     \nInternal Revenue Service limits governing our \nqualified 401(k) plan. It also allows the     \nNEOs, excluding the CEO, to defer additional  \npre-taxcompensation in order to save for      \nretirement. The CEO participates in the VNQDCP\non a non-voluntarybasis, as the deferred cash \nportion of his year-endincentive is           \nmandatorily deferred in the VNQDCP for three  \nyears. Capital One periodically reviews       \npension and other deferred compensation       \nprograms and practices at our peer comparator \ncompanies and across the financial services   \nindustry. We also review changes in the legal \nand regulatory environment pertaining to      \nretirement programs. Details of the VNQDCP can\nbe found under \u201cCapital One\u2019s Voluntary Non-  \nQualifiedDeferred Compensation Programs\u201d on   \npage 128. Employment Agreements Capital One   \ntypically does not enter into defined term    \nemployment agreements with the NEOs in order  \nto maintain maximum flexibility in            \nestablishing separation terms at the          \nappropriate time and considering their current\ncircumstances. The Committee retains full     \ndiscretion to approve employment agreements on\nan exception basis and has done so for        \nexceptional circumstances in the past. None of\nthe current NEOs have an employment agreement.\nChange of Control Agreements Each NEO         \ncurrently employed by the Company is a party  \nto an agreement providing certain benefits if \nthe executive\u2019s employment terminates in      \nconnection with a change of control, as well  \nas compensation and benefits protections      \nduring the two-yearperiod following the change\nof control. The change of control agreements  \ndefine compensation and benefits payable to   \nNEOs in certain merger and acquisition        \nscenarios. The Committee believes these       \nagreements provide the NEOs with some         \ncertainty and allow the NEOs to remain neutral\nand consider a full range of strategic        \ndecisions that are focused on maximizing      \nstockholder value. The change of control      \nagreements are also intended to allow Capital \nOne\u2019s businesses to operate with minimal      \ndisruption in the event of a change of control\nby providing each NEO with an incentive to    \nremain in his or her leadership role up to and\nbeyond the transaction date. In addition to   \ncompensation and benefits protections during a\ntwo-yearprotection period after a change of   \ncontrol, the NEOs are entitled to severance   \nbenefits under the agreements if their        \nemployment is actually terminated as a result \nof (or in anticipation of) certain merger and \nacquisition scenarios.                        \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  116    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII\u2014Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nBoth eligibility for participation and the    \nstructure of payments under these agreements  \nare designed to be aligned with market        \npractice in the banking and financial services\nindustry. Our program is designed so that our \nstockholders are not faced with               \ndisproportionate severance costs that may     \nimpair potential merger opportunities. In     \naddition, our change of control agreements for\nexecutive officers do not provide for excise  \ntax \u201cgross-up\u201dpayments. Projections of        \npotential payouts to the NEOs under these     \nagreements are included in the total          \ncompensation tally sheets reviewed by the     \nCommittee on an annual basis. Although the    \npotential change of control payouts do not    \nnecessarily impact annual decisions on NEO    \npay, reviewing this information allows the    \nCommittee to fully understand the downstream  \nimplications of its decisions and the         \nresulting impact to the Company and its       \nstockholders. Additional details regarding    \nthese agreements can be found under \u201cPayments \nUnder Certain Termination Scenarios\u201d beginning\non page 131. Post-Employment Compensation     \nPractices The CEO has no employment or        \nseverance arrangement with the Company other  \nthan the change of control agreement as       \ndescribed above. If an NEO, excluding the CEO,\nseparates from Capital One, they are entitled \nto receive the amounts set forth in the       \nCompany\u2019s Executive Severance Plan, which     \nprovides for a payment of up to 30% of the    \nNEO\u2019s then-current total target compensation  \nplus a pro-ratedseverance bonus based on the  \nNEO\u2019s target cash incentive in the event of   \ninvoluntary termination without cause due to  \nrestructuring. Additional benefits include    \npartially subsidized health, dental, and      \nvision benefits for a period of up to 18      \nmonths through COBRA, and outplacement        \nservices for a period of up to one year       \nfollowing separation. The Committee may       \nexercise its discretion in approving          \nadditional amounts in light of all relevant   \ncircumstances, including the NEO\u2019s term of    \nemployment, past accomplishments, reasons for \nseparation from the Company, potential risks  \nand the NEO\u2019s willingness to restrict their   \nfuture action(s), such as through an agreement\nnot to compete or solicit the Company\u2019s       \ncustomers or associates. In addition,         \nfollowing a separation from Capital One,      \ncertain equity-based awards will continue to  \nvest according to their original terms, as    \ndescribed under \u201cPayments Under Certain       \nTermination Scenarios\u201d beginning on page 131. \nCapital One has entered into agreements with  \ncertain NEOs that contain restrictive         \ncovenants related to confidentiality, non-    \ncompetition, non-solicitation,and ownership of\nwork product. For additional information, see \n\u201cRestrictive Covenants\u201d beginning on page 130.\nUpon retiring from the Company, associates,   \nincluding the NEOs, will have access to a     \nvariety of medical plans through Mercer       \nMarketplace 365+ Retiree private exchange     \n(\u201cMercer\u201d). Generally, retirees who meet the  \ncriteria for subsidized retiree medical       \ncoverage and enroll in a plan through Mercer  \nwill receive funding from Capital One in a    \nHealth Reimbursement Account (\u201cHRA\u201d). NEOs who\nmeet the retirement criteria may also elect to\nreceive 18 months of COBRA coverage. In       \naddition, certain equity-based awards will    \ncontinue to vest according to their original  \nterms, as described under \u201cPayments Upon      \nRetirement\u201d beginning on page 132. Other      \nAspects of Executive Compensation Stock       \nOwnership and Retention Requirements          \nConsistent with their responsibilities to our \nstockholders, the executive officers are      \nrequired to maintain a significant financial  \nstake in the Company.

The CEO\u2019s Stock Ownership          \nRequirement was increased to an amount equal  \nto six multiplied by $1.75 million, or $10.5  \nmillion. In addition, the CEO and all other   \nNEOs are required to continue to hold 50% of  \ntheir Stock Ownership Requirement for one year\nfollowing termination, retirement, or ceasing \nto serve as an executive officer, except in   \ncase of termination by death, disability, or  \nin connection with a change of control. The   \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve that these Stock Ownership            \nRequirements have increased the alignment of  \nCEO and all other NEO compensation with       \nstockholder interests. Ownership requirements \nmay be fulfilled using the following shares:  \n                                         \n  \u220e    Shares owned without restriction  \n                                         \n                                  \n  \u220e    Unvested restricted stock  \n                                  \n                                    \n  \u220e    Unvested stock-settled RSUs  \n                                    \n                                              \n  \u220e    Shares acquired through the 2002       \n       Associate Stock Purchase Plan          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Shares owned through the Capital One   \n  \u220e    Stock Fund in Capital One\u2019s 401(k)     \n       plan                                   \n                                              \nUnexercised stock options and unvested        \nperformance share awards may not be used to   \nfulfill ownership requirements. The Committee \nreviews the guidelines and monitors the CEO\u2019s \nand the other NEOs\u2019 compliance with them. New \nexecutive officers are given five years from  \nthe date of promotion to or appointment as an \nexecutive officer to comply with the Stock    \nOwnership Requirements. In the event that an  \nexecutive officer is not in compliance with   \nthese requirements, the Committee has the     \nright to take action, including reducing the  \nexecutive officer\u2019s compensation. The CEO and \nall other NEOs are currently in compliance    \nwith this requirement. The Company has stock  \nretention requirements for certain equity     \nawards made to the CEO and the other NEOs.    \nWith respect to awards of performance shares  \nand stock-settled RSUs that vest (i) during an\nexecutive\u2019s term of employment with Capital   \nOne, or (ii) as applicable, prior to the first\nanniversary of such executive\u2019s separation    \nfrom Capital One, each executive must hold 50%\nof the after-taxnet shares acquired (\u201cRetained\nShares\u201d) for a period of one year after the   \nacquisition date of the shares. In addition,  \nfor performance shares and stock-settled RSUs \ngranted after January 2021, the Company       \nrequires that Retained Shares continue to be  \nheld beyond the one-yearperiod until the CEO  \nand the other NEOs\u2019 Stock Ownership           \nRequirement, as described above, is met. These\nstock ownership and retention requirements    \napply to all of our executive officers.       \nProhibition of Hedging, Speculative Trading   \nActivities, and Pledging As part of the       \ncommitment by Capital One\u2019s leadership team to\nmaintain public confidence in the long-term   \ngrowth of Capital One\u2019s stock, Capital One    \nmaintains a policy prohibiting hedging and    \nspeculative trading activities. Specifically, \nthe policy prohibits certain individuals from \nengaging in short sales, hedging transactions,\nor speculative trading in derivative          \nsecurities of Capital One stock. The policy   \napplies to all Capital One directors, officers\n(as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange  \nAct), and together with Capital One directors,\n\u201cControl Group Members\u201d), and associates who  \n(i) serve at the Senior Vice President level  \nor above, (ii) report directly to a Control   \nGroup Member, or (iii) are otherwise          \ndetermined by Capital One\u2019s General Counsel to\nbe an \u201cinsider.\u201d The policy applies to all    \nshares of Capital One stock held by those     \npersons covered by the policy, regardless of  \nwhether the stock was granted as compensation \nby Capital One or is otherwise held directly  \nor indirectly. Capital One also prohibits its \nControl Group Members from using Capital One  \nsecurities, including common stock, in a      \nmargin account or pledging Capital One        \nsecurities as collateral for a loan.          \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  118    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VIII\u2014Compensation Discussion and    \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nEquity Grant Practices Capital One strives to \nmaintain equity grant practices that          \ndemonstrate high standards of corporate       \ngovernance. Annual incentive awards generally \nare approved by the Committee and the         \nIndependent Directors (or by authority        \ndelegated to the Chief Human Resources Officer\nfor certain associates who are not executive  \nofficers) at regularly scheduled meetings in  \nthe first quarter of each year. The date of   \ngrant is the actual date on which the         \nCommittee approves the awards. The Committee  \nmay grant awards of restricted stock, RSUs,   \nstock options, or other equity awards outside \nof the annual incentive cycle. The Committee  \nhas delegated authority to the CEO to award   \nrestricted stock and to the Chief Human       \nResources Officer to award stock-settled and  \ncash-settled RSUs (but not options or other   \nequity awards) to associates who are not      \nexecutive officers, subject to a maximum      \namount of $2 million for any associate in any \none year with an aggregate $50 million annual \nlimit. These awards are designed to be used   \nfor new hires and for special programs        \ndesigned by management to incentivize, retain,\nand reward current associates of the Company. \nThe Committee reviews all grants made by      \ndelegation at least once per year and approves\nall grants that exceed the annual delegation  \nlimit. With respect to awards of stock        \noptions, the exercise price is always the Fair\nMarket Value of Capital One common stock on   \nthe date of grant. Under the terms of our 2004\nStock Incentive Plan, \u201cFair Market Value\u201d is  \nequal to the closing price of Capital One     \ncommon stock on the date of grant. The Company\ndoes not seek to time equity grants to take   \nadvantage of material non-publicinformation,  \nand in no event is the grant date set to a    \ndate that is prior to the date of approval.   \nTax Considerations The Committee carefully    \nconsiders the tax impacts of its compensation \nprograms on the Company, as well as on its    \nexecutives. To maintain flexibility in        \ncompensating executive officers, the Committee\ndoes not require all compensation to be paid  \nor awarded in a tax-deductiblemanner.         \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           119  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection IX - Named Executive Officer          \nCompensation 2022 Summary Compensation Table  \nThe Summary Compensation Table below provides \ninformation about compensation for the fiscal \nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 \nfor the NEOs. As discussed in the             \n\u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section\nbeginning on page 78, our executive           \ncompensation program is heavily weighted      \ntowards equity-based and at-riskelements of   \ncompensation. Under SEC rules, equity-based   \ncompensation is reported in the Summary       \nCompensation Table below in the year in which \nit is awarded, which may not correlate to the \nyear for which it is paid.

These      \nawards (as well as cash-settled RSUs for the  \nCEO) reported below are also subject to       \nperformance-based vesting provisions that are \nassociated with Core Earnings. As a result,   \nthe total number of shares delivered at       \nvesting will be reduced if the Company does   \nnot achieve certain performance thresholds    \nduring the three-year vesting period.

Prior to  \nNovember 1995, Capital One offered a Cash     \nBalance Pension Plan (\u201cCBPP\u201d) and an Excess   \nCash Balance Plan (\u201cExcess CBPP\u201d) to all full-\ntime salaried associates and certain executive\nofficers. Both of these programs were frozen  \nin December 1995; however, interest continues \nto accrue on plan balances on a quarterly     \nbasis for the CBPP and on a monthly basis for \nthe Excess CBPP. The CBPP interest rate       \nchanges annually, based on the average yield  \nof five-year U.S. Treasury Securities for the \nmonth of October of the prior plan year (1.12%\nfor 2022). The Excess CBPP interest rate      \nchanges monthly based on the Wall Street      \nJournal Prime Rate (4.77% annual average for  \n2022). Mr. Fairbank participated in these     \nprograms. The estimated annual payouts upon   \nretirement in the CBPP and the Excess CBPP as \nof December 31, 2021, are $2,740 and $10,202, \nrespectively, for Mr. Fairbank. As of December\n31, 2022, the \u201cPresent Value of Accumulated   \nBenefit\u201d for Mr. Fairbank for both plans is   \nequal to his account balance because Mr.      \nFairbank has attained the normal retirement   \nage of 65 and so is assumed to retire         \nimmediately under the actuarial valuation     \nassumptions. Since Mr. Fairbank is assumed to \nretire as of the measurement date, the future \ninterest rate does not apply. The account in  \neach plan is distributed after any separation \nfrom service. Distribution options from the   \nCBPP plan are lump sum (eligible for rollover \nto another qualified plan or personal IRA) or \nan annuity option.

The distribution schedules available \nunder the plan include lump sum and, in the   \ncase of retirement, five-, ten-,or fifteen-   \nyear annual installments. Prior to December   \n31, 2005, Capital One offered its executives  \nan Excess Savings Plan (\u201cESP\u201d).

Capital One has     \nasked certain NEOs to enter into various      \nagreements that contain restrictive covenants \nrelated to confidentiality, non-competition,  \nnon-solicitation,and ownership of work        \nproduct, as described below. Non-             \nCompetitionAgreements Messrs. Yajnik and Young\nhave entered into non-competitionagreements   \nwith the Company pursuant to which they may be\nrestricted as to what competitive services    \nthey may provide to an entity following       \nseparation from Capital One. These non-       \ncompetitionagreements provide for the         \nfollowing in exchange for the NEO complying   \nwith non-competitionrestrictions for up to two\nyears following an involuntary termination,   \nother than for cause, death, or disability:   \npayment equal to 15% of the NEO\u2019s total target\ncompensation for each year of enforcement and \nsubsidized health insurance premiums for a    \nperiod of up to 18 months of through COBRA if \nthe NEO is eligible and elects such coverage, \nsubject to certain terms and conditions. The  \npayments are made in two lump sums: the first \nfollowing termination and the second upon     \nsuccessful completion of the enforcement      \nperiod. In the event of a voluntary           \ntermination, the previously described payments\nare typically made for the second year of     \nenforcement for agreements with a two-        \nyearenforcement period. Notice & Garden Leave \nAgreement Mr. Blinde has entered into a Notice\n& Garden Leave Agreement with the Company     \npursuant to which he agreed to provide Capital\nOne with 180 days prior written notice before \nhe terminates his employment. The agreement   \nestablishes Mr. Blinde\u2019s duties and           \nobligations to Capital One during a garden    \nleave period prior to the termination of his  \nemployment. Mr. Blinde will remain an employee\nand continue to receive his base salary, as   \nwell as other pay and benefits per the terms  \nof the agreement and applicable plans or      \nprograms. He will be expected to continue to  \nundertake the duties and responsibilities as  \nare assigned to him by Capital One during the \ngarden leave period, including to assist      \nCapital One with his transition from the      \nCompany and maintaining Capital One\u2019s         \nbusiness, relationships and goodwill. Capital \nOne may, in its discretion, limit or modify   \nhis regular duties, or put Mr. Blinde on paid \nleave for all or part of his garden leave     \nperiod. Further, Mr. Blinde must not, directly\nor indirectly, provide any services to any    \nother employer or entity during the garden    \nleave period, nor be employed by any other    \nentity, without Capital One\u2019s prior written   \nconsent.                                      \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  130    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section IX - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nConfidentiality, Work Product, and Non-       \nSolicitationof Employee Agreement Messrs.     \nBlinde, Yajnik and Young are parties to       \nconfidentiality, work product, and non-       \nsolicitationof employee agreements. The       \nconfidentiality provisions of these agreements\ngenerally provide that at all times during and\nfollowing employment with the Company, these  \nNEOs may not use for personal benefit or the  \nbenefit of others, or divulge to others, any  \nof Capital One\u2019s confidential information,    \nexcept as expressly authorized by Capital One \nor required by legal process. Mr. Yajnik\u2019s    \nagreement also provides that, for a period of \ntwo years following separation from Capital   \nOne, he shall not directly or indirectly      \nsolicit or induce any associate of Capital One\nto become employed by any person or entity    \nengaged in competition with Capital One, and  \nshall not directly or indirectly solicit or   \ninduce any associate of Capital One to end    \ntheir employment based on confidential        \ninformation learned about the associate while \nthey were employed by Capital One. For Messrs.\nBlinde and Young, their agreements also       \nprovide that, for a period of two years       \nfollowing separation from Capital One, these  \nNEOs shall not, directly or indirectly, (i)   \nsolicit or induce any covered Capital One     \nassociate to become employed by any other     \nperson or entity, (ii) hire or otherwise      \nengage any covered Capital One associate (or a\nperson who was a covered associate and        \nresigned in the prior three months) to work   \nfor or provide services to any other person or\nentity, or (iii) solicit or induce any Capital\nOne employee to leave or cease their          \nemployment with Capital One, or to hire or    \notherwise engage any Capital One employee to  \nwork for or provide services to any other     \nperson or entity, if based on confidential    \ninformation these NEOs learned about such     \nemployee while employed by Capital One.       \nPayments Under Certain Termination Scenarios  \nUpon separation from the Company, the NEOs,   \nregardless of the reason for termination,     \nreceive certain earned, but previously unpaid,\npayments, such as accrued but unused vacation \npay and amounts earned and vested under the   \nCompany\u2019s qualified and non-                  \nqualifiedretirement programs. In addition,    \ncash-settled RSUs granted to NEOs, other than \nthe CEO, after the end of a performance year  \ncontinue to vest according to the original    \nprovisions of such grants upon separation for \nany reason other than cause or as soon as     \npracticable following a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d      \nchange of control (as discussed below).       \nVoluntary Termination An NEO, other than the  \nCEO, who voluntarily terminates employment    \nwith Capital One may receive payments related \nto non-competitioncovenants (described above, \nif applicable) and any contractual payments to\nwhich the NEO may otherwise be entitled. In   \naddition, the NEO has the ability following   \nseparation to exercise vested but unexercised \noptions for three months following voluntary  \ntermination. Involuntary Termination Without  \nCause An NEO, other than the CEO, whose       \nemployment with Capital One is terminated     \ninvoluntarily, for performance or job         \nelimination, is entitled to receive the       \namounts set forth in the Company\u2019s Executive  \nSeverance Plan in exchange for executing a    \nrelease of claims against the Company. For    \n2022, potential payments under the Executive  \nSeverance Plan were 30% of total target       \ncompensation, plus a severance bonus based on \nsuch NEO\u2019s target cash incentive in the event \nof termination due to restructuring.          \nAdditional benefits include healthcare        \ncontinuation subsidy through COBRA,           \noutplacement services, and any contractual    \npayments to which the NEO may otherwise have  \nbeen entitled. Until April 24, 2022, if an    \nNEO\u2019s Non-CompetitionAgreement is enforced,   \ncash payments under the Executive Severance   \nPlan, other than the severance bonus, will be \noffset by any cash amounts paid under their   \nrespective Non-CompetitionAgreement, and the  \nNEO will be eligible for an additional payment\nof up to 90% of the severance payments in     \nexchange for executing a release of claims    \nagainst the Company. Generally, performance   \nshares granted to NEOs will vest in full,     \nbased on actual Company performance and stock-\nsettled RSUs granted to NEOs will continue to \nvest, subject to the NEO\u2019s execution of a     \nrelease of claims against                     \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           131  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section IX - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nthe Company. In addition, NEOs have the       \nability to exercise vested but unexercised    \noptions for two years following separation. If\nan NEO\u2019s employment with Capital One is       \nterminated as a result of death or disability,\nthe NEO\u2019s unvested RSUs and performance shares\nwill vest in full based on target Company     \nperformance. Payments Upon Retirement As with \nall executives who are eligible for           \nretirement, NEOs who retire from Capital One  \nmay receive the following amounts: payments   \nrelated to non-competitioncovenants as if they\nhad terminated voluntarily (as described      \nabove); up to 18 months of subsidized COBRA   \ncoverage; any contractual payments to which   \nthey may otherwise be entitled; and, for      \nMessrs. Fairbank and Yajnik, who became       \neligible to retire on or before December 31,  \n2012, a retiree medical subsidy and access to \na variety of medical plans through a private  \nexchange. Retirees eligible for subsidized    \nretiree medical coverage receive funding      \nthrough a Health Reimbursement Account which  \ncan be used to pay for health care insurance  \npremiums or eligible claims expenses. Upon    \nretirement, all RSUs continue to vest         \naccording to their original terms based on    \nactual performance, which, for stock-settled  \nRSUs granted during or after 2012, also       \nincludes performance-based vesting provisions.\nIn addition, performance shares granted to    \nNEOs will continue to vest after retirement.  \nFor stock options, the executive has until the\nexpiration of the option term to exercise     \nvested but unexercised options. Termination   \nfor Cause Generally, an NEO whose employment  \nwith Capital One is terminated for cause      \nreceives no additional benefits but is        \nrequired to comply with any applicable        \nrestrictive covenants related to              \nconfidentiality, non-competition, non-        \nsolicitationof associates or customers, and   \nownership of work product, as described above.\nIn addition, if terminated for cause, the NEOs\nhave the ability following separation to      \nexercise vested but unexercised options for   \nthree months. Change of Control Each NEO is a \nparty to an agreement (a \u201cChange of Control   \nAgreement\u201d) that provides for certain payments\nin the event their employment is terminated   \nwithin two years following (or within one year\nprior to but in anticipation of) a change of  \ncontrol of Capital One, either involuntarily  \nwithout cause or voluntarily for good reason. \nAmounts payable in each of these scenarios are\noutlined below. Pursuant to the agreements, a \n\u201cchange of control\u201d occurs if one or more of  \nthe following events take place: (i) an       \nacquisition of 20% or more of Capital One     \ncommon stock or the combined voting power of  \nthe voting securities of Capital One by a     \nperson or group, (ii) certain changes in the  \nmajority of the Board, (iii) consummation of a\nreorganization, merger, share exchange or     \nconsolidation or similar transaction, sale of \nall assets or the acquisition of another      \ncompany, except where all or substantially all\nof Capital One\u2019s stockholders receive 50% or  \nmore of the stock of the resulting company, at\nleast a majority of the board of directors of \nthe resulting company were incumbent Board    \nmembers, and no person owns 20% or more of the\nresulting company who did not own such stock  \nimmediately before the business combination,  \nor (iv) approval by stockholders of a complete\nliquidation or dissolution of Capital One. In \nthe event of a change of control, we do not   \nprovide for excise tax gross-uppayments. In   \naddition, all equity awards granted to the    \nNEOs require a so-called\u201cdouble trigger\u201d for  \naccelerated vesting in connection with a      \nchange of control. Upon a change of control,  \nall equity awards continue to vest according  \nto their original schedule. The vesting of    \nsuch awards only accelerates if an NEO is     \ninvoluntarily terminated without cause or     \nvoluntarily terminates for \u201cgood reason\u201d (as  \ndefined in the agreements) within the two     \nyears following a change of control.          \nTermination for Cause in Connection with a    \nChange of Control NEOs terminated             \ninvoluntarily for cause following a change of \ncontrol receive no additional benefits except \nwith regard to options, which allow NEOs to   \nexercise vested but unexercised options for   \nthree months following a termination for      \ncause.                                        \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  132    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section IX - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nVoluntary Termination with Good Reason or     \nInvoluntary Termination Without Cause in      \nConnection with a Change of Control In the    \nevent of a voluntary termination with good    \nreason or an involuntary termination without  \ncause, the potential payments that the NEOs   \ncould receive under certain termination       \nscenarios are based on a percentage of total  \ntarget compensation. For the CEO, the         \npotential payments are based on a multiple of \nhis notional salary and year-endincentive     \nopportunity.

To identify the     \nmedian employee, we used the following        \nmethodology and consistently applied material \nassumptions, adjustments and estimates:       \n                                              \n       We identified the median compensated   \n       employee of our global employee        \n       population of 54,555 as of October\u00a01,  \n       2022 (the \u201cDetermination Date\u201d) by     \n       comparing a consistently applied       \n  \u220e    compensation measure consisting of     \n       salary, wages (including overtime),    \n       bonuses and commissions paid to our    \n       employees over the twelve-month        \n       period preceding the Determination     \n       Date (the \u201cEstimated Compensation\u201d).   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Based on the Estimated Compensation    \n       of each employee, we identified a      \n       cohort of 61 employees, consisting of  \n       the employee with the median           \n       Estimated Compensation value and the   \n       30 employees above and 30 employees    \n       below that employee (the \u201cMedian       \n       Cohort\u201d). We then removed ten          \n       employees from the Median Cohort who   \n  \u220e    appeared to bear anomalous             \n       characteristics (such as               \n       participation in non-U.S.              \n       compensation programs, a hire date     \n       during the fiscal year, or separation  \n       prior to the end of the fiscal year)   \n       that could significantly distort the   \n       pay ratio calculation, and then        \n       identified the median employee from    \n       the remaining employees in the Median  \n       Cohort.                                \n                                              \nThe SEC\u2019s rules for identifying the median    \ncompensated employee and calculating the pay  \nratio based on that employee\u2019s Annual Total   \nCompensation allow companies to adopt a       \nvariety of methodologies, to apply certain    \nexclusions, and to make reasonable estimates  \nand assumptions that reflect their employee   \npopulations and compensation practices. As a  \nresult, the pay ratio reported by other       \ncompanies may not be comparable to the pay    \nratio reported above, as other companies have \ndifferent employee populations and            \ncompensation practices and may utilize        \ndifferent methodologies, exclusions,          \nestimates, and assumptions in calculating     \ntheir own pay ratios.                         \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           135  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section IX - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nPay versus Performance As required by Section \n953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform a \nnd Consumer Protection Act, we are providing  \nthe information below to illustrate the       \nrelationship between the SEC-                 \ndefinedcompensation actually paid (\u201cCAP\u201d) and \nvarious measures used to gauge the Company\u2019s  \nfinancial performance in conformance with Item\n402(v) of Regulation S-K.CAP is calculated in \naccordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation     \nS-Kand differs from compensation shown in the \nSummary Compensation Table on page 120 and CEO\nand other NEO performance year compensation   \ntables shown on pages 103 and 110,            \nrespectively.

This alignment\nis due to the Company\u2019s executive compensation\nprogram being comprised of primarily equity,  \nwith 84% of PEO and approximately 51% of all  \nNon-PEONEO\u2019s total compensation for the 2022  \nperformance year being comprised of equit     \ny-based compensation, similar to prior years. \nIn addition, a portion of PEO compensation is \ndirectly linked to the Company\u2019s TSR and vests\nentirely on the Company\u2019s TSR performance     \nrelative to the Performance Share Peers over a\nthree-year period. CAP versus Net Income As   \nshown in the chart above, the Company\u2019s net   \nincome has varied over the three-year         \nmeasurement period. While net income has      \nincreased and decreased directionally with PEO\nand other NEO CAP, the changes are not        \nproportionally correlated with CAP. This is   \ndue in large part to the large portion of PEO \nand other NEO compensation that is equity-    \nbased compensation as well as the significant,\nvolatility of GAAP net income that resulted   \nfrom the pandemic covered by the measurement  \nperiod. In addition, while net income is one  \nof several factors used to assess Company     \nperformance, the Company does not use net     \nincome as a primary metric to determine       \ncompensation levels or incentive plan payout. \nCAP versus D+TBV As shown in the chart above, \nthe PEO and other NEO\u2019s CAP amounts are       \naligned with the company selected measure of  \nD+TBV. This alignment is primarily due to a   \nlarge portion of PEO and other NEO            \ncompensation being comprised of Financial     \nPerformance Shares (as described on page 94). \nFor the 2022 performance year, 63% of PEO     \ntotal compensation and an average of 28% of   \nother NEO total compensation was granted in   \nthe form of Financial Performance Shares,     \nsimilar to prior years. Two-thirdsof the      \npayout of each Financial Performance Share    \nupon vesting is based on D+TBV. Company TSR   \nversus Peer Group TSR As shown in the chart   \nabove, the TSR peer group is based on the S&P \nFinancial Index, which reflect\u2019s the Company\u2019s\nindustry sector. The Company\u2019s three-year     \ncumulative TSR was below that of the S&P      \nFinancial Index. This was primarily due to    \nelevated uncertainty about future economic    \nconditions having a more negative impact on   \nCapital One\u2019s share price than on the Index   \nmembers who, on average, have less exposure to\nlending and short-term cyclical factors. In   \naddition, growing economic uncertainty and its\npossible effect on future credit performance  \nand profitability had a significant negative  \nimpact on bank stock prices and on large      \nconsumer lending companies in particular,     \nincluding Capital One. Company Selected       \nMeasures When determining the compensation    \npaid to our NEOs, the Committee and the       \nIndependent Directors consider the Company\u2019s  \nperformance against four categories of        \nquantitative and qualitative performance      \nfactors related to: financial and operating   \nperformance, governance and risk management,  \nstrategic performance, and winning with our   \ncustomers and associates. See \u201cCompany        \nPerformance Assessment\u201d beginning on page 99  \nfor a description of the Company\u2019s 2022       \nperformance, based on the Company Performance \nFactors.

ROTCE is broadly used in  \n       banking as a key performance           \n       indicator and component in peer        \n       executive compensation programs.       \n                                              \n                                              \n       Adjusted ROTCE is calculated as the    \n       ratio, expressed as a percentage, of   \n       (i)\u00a0the Company\u2019s net income           \n       available to common stockholders,      \n  \u220e    excluding, on atax-adjustedbasis, the  \n       impact of impairment, amortization     \n       andre-measurementof intangible         \n       assets, to (ii)\u00a0the Company\u2019s average  \n       tangible common equity.                \n                                              \nNet Revenue                                   \n                                              \n       Net revenue, and the growth of net     \n       revenue, is a reflection of the        \n       Company\u2019s ability to grow new          \n       customer relationships, deepen         \n       existing relationships and expand      \n       into new businesses and areas of       \n  \u220e    focus and market opportunity. Net      \n       revenue serves as the key driver for   \n       long-term earnings power and requires  \n       delivery of compelling products and    \n       experiences as well as a sustainable,  \n       through-cycle pricing strategy and     \n       business model.                        \n                                              \nThe Committee and the Independent Directors   \nbelieve these three financial metrics provide \na measure of Company performance that balances\ncreation of stockholder value, returns        \ngenerated on stockholders\u2019 investment in the  \nCompany, and long-term financial              \nsustainability. Each of the metrics are       \nconsidered in the award and/or payout of      \ncompensation awarded to our NEOs under the    \nexecutive compensation program for each of the\nperformance years shown in the tables above.  \nD+TBV and Adjusted ROTCE are both earnings and\nprofit-driven measures that have shown to be  \nstrong indicators of long-term shareholder    \nvalue. These two metrics, in combination, are \nused to determine the amount paid to our NEOs \nupon the vesting of the Financial Performance \nShares, which represented nearly 47% of 2022  \nperformance year compensation awarded to our  \nCEO and approximately 28% of the performance  \nyear compensation awarded to our non-CEONEOs  \nfor the 2022 performance year. For additional \ninformation on the composition of the         \nFinancial Performance Shares see \u201cPerformance \nShare Awards\u201d beginning on page 93. Earnings  \nand profit-driven measures, such as D+TBV and \nAdjusted ROTCE can be affected by the pace and\nlevel of long-term investment in areas like   \ntalent, technology and marketing as well as   \nshort-term or cyclical factors such as credit \ncosts. As such, the Committee and the         \nIndependent Directors believe that net        \nrevenue, and the growth of net revenue to be  \nimportant complements to earnings-driven      \nmeasures and important indicators of Capital  \nOne\u2019s financial strength, growth trajectory,  \nand long-term sustainability.                 \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  138    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \nSection X - Equity Compensation Plans Equity  \nCompensation Plan Information The following   \ntable provides information as of December 31, \n2022, with respect to our equity compensation \nplans under which shares of Capital One common\nstock are authorized to be issued.            \n                                              \n                                      Number  \n                                          of  \n               Number                securi\u2026  \n                   of                remain\u2026  \n             securit\u2026                availa\u2026  \n                to be    Weighte\u2026        for  \n               issued    exercise     future  \n                 upon    price of    issuan\u2026  \n             exercise    outstan\u2026      under  \n                   of    options,     equity  \n             outstan\u2026    warrants    compen\u2026  \n             options,         and      plans  \n             warrants      rights    (exclu\u2026  \n                  and                securi\u2026  \n               rights                reflec\u2026  \n                                          in  \n                                      column  \n                                        (a))  \n  Plan             -a          -b         -c  \n  Catego\u2026                                     \n  Equity                                      \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plans                                       \n  approv\u2026    7,707,9\u2026      $75.12    19,592\u2026  \n  by                                          \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  holder\u2026                                     \n  Equity                                      \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plans                                       \n  not        24,340(\u2026          $\u2014       0(5)  \n  approv\u2026                                     \n  by                                          \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  holders                                     \n  Total      7,732,2\u2026      $75.12    19,592\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The following plans have been          \n       approved by our stockholders and are   \n  (1)  currently in effect: the 2004 Stock    \n       Incentive Plan and the 2002 Associate  \n       Stock Purchase Plan.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Excludes purchase rights accruing      \n       under the 2002 Associate Stock         \n       Purchase Plan.

The Audit  \nCommittee evaluates the independent registered\npublic accounting firm\u2019s qualifications,      \nperformance, and independence at least        \nannually and periodically considers whether to\ncontinue to retain our current independent    \nregistered public accounting firm or whether  \nto engage another firm. In connection with    \napplicable partner rotation requirements, the \nAudit Committee and its Chair are involved in \nconsidering the selection of the independent  \nregistered public accounting firm\u2019s new lead  \npartner. Additionally, Capital One adheres to \nthe requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    \nrelating to the rotation of partners engaged  \nin Capital One\u2019s audit by the independent     \nregistered public accounting firm. For 2023,  \nthe Audit Committee has appointed Ernst &     \nYoung LLP (\u201cErnst & Young\u201d) as Capital One\u2019s  \nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nErnst & Young has served in this role since   \n1994. The members of the Audit Committee and  \nthe Board believe that the continued retention\nof Ernst & Young as Capital One\u2019s independent \nregistered public accounting firm is in the   \nbest interests of Capital One and its         \nstockholders. The Board is submitting this    \nproposal to the vote of the stockholders as a \nmatter of good corporate governance. If       \nstockholders do not ratify the selection of   \nErnst & Young, the Audit Committee will       \nreconsider the appointment of Ernst & Young as\nthe Company\u2019s independent registered public   \naccounting firm.

The  \nAudit Committee has reviewed the fees paid to \nErnst & Young and has considered whether the  \nfees paid for non-Auditservices are compatible\nwith maintaining Ernst & Young\u2019s independence.\nThe Audit Committee also adopted policies and \nprocedures to approve services provided by    \nErnst & Young in accordance with the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act and rules of the SEC promulgated    \nthereunder. These policies and procedures     \ninvolve annual pre-approvalby the Audit       \nCommittee of the types of services to be      \nprovided by Ernst & Young. Any service        \nengagements that exceed these pre-            \napprovedlimits must be submitted to the Audit \nCommittee for specific pre-approval.If the    \nactual expenditure for pre-approvedservices is\nanticipated to exceed, or exceeds, the pre-   \napprovedcost levels by more than $50,000, the \nincremental amount requires separate approval \nby the Audit Committee. In 2022, all of the   \nAudit and Audit-Related Fees and related      \nservices were pre-approvedby the Audit        \nCommittee pursuant to the policies and        \nprocedures described above. Under the policy  \nadopted by the Audit Committee, Tax Fees are  \nlimited to 25% of combined Audit and Audit-   \nRelated Fees, and services that would fall    \nunder the category \u201cAll Other Fees\u201d are       \nprohibited. One or more representatives of    \nErnst & Young are expected to be present at   \nthe 2023 Annual Stockholder Meeting. They will\nhave the opportunity to make a statement if   \nthey desire to do so and will be available to \nrespond to appropriate questions from         \nstockholders. *** The Board unanimously       \nrecommends that you vote \u201cFOR\u201d the            \nratification of Ernst & Young LLP as Capital  \nOne\u2019s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2023.                                \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           145  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                 \n  AUDIT MATTERS  \n                 \nSection XIV - Audit Committee Report Roles and\nResponsibilities of the Audit Committee In    \naccordance with its charter, the Audit        \nCommittee assists the Board of Directors in   \nfulfilling its obligations with respect to the\nitems listed in \u201cCommittee Responsibilities\u201d  \non page 42. Our Audit Committee is composed of\nfive Board members. Each member of the Audit  \nCommittee is \u201cfinancially literate\u201d in the    \njudgment of the Board. No member of the Audit \nCommittee simultaneously serves on the audit  \ncommittees of more than three public          \ncompanies, including that of Capital One.     \nAudit Committee Policies and Procedures The   \nAudit Committee has implemented procedures to \nenable it to devote the attention it deems    \nappropriate to each of the matters assigned to\nit under its charter, including candid        \ncommunications with management and Ernst &    \nYoung, Capital One\u2019s independent registered   \npublic accounting firm, to discuss new        \nauditing standards and emerging audit-related \nissues. In carrying out its responsibilities, \nthe Audit Committee met a total of 10 times   \nduring 2022. Pursuant to Capital One\u2019s        \nCorporate Governance Guidelines and applicable\nlaw, the Audit Committee is comprised solely  \nof independent directors. Required            \nCommunications with Ernst & Young In          \ndischarging its oversight responsibility      \nthroughout the year, the Audit Committee      \nproactively engaged with management and Ernst \n& Young on matters relating to Capital One\u2019s  \nfinancial reporting. The Audit Committee has  \nreviewed and discussed Capital One\u2019s audited  \nfinancial statements for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and the assessment of the  \neffectiveness of Capital One\u2019s internal       \ncontrol over financial reporting, with        \nmanagement and Ernst & Young. The Audit       \nCommittee has also discussed with Ernst &     \nYoung the applicable requirements of the      \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board and \nthe SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee has \nreceived the written disclosures and the      \nletter from Ernst & Young required by the     \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board     \nregarding Ernst & Young\u2019s communications with \nthe Audit Committee concerning independence   \nand has discussed with Ernst & Young their    \nindependence from Capital One.

Stockholder Proposal The resolution    \nbeing submitted by Mr. Chevedden to the       \nstockholders for approval, if properly        \npresented, is as follows: Proposal 7 \u2014 Simple \nMajority Vote RESOLVED, Shareholders request  \nthat our board take each step necessary so    \nthat each voting requirement in our charter   \nand bylaws (that is explicit or implicit due  \nto default to state law) that calls for a     \ngreater than simple majority vote be replaced \nby a requirement for a majority of the votes  \ncast for and against such proposals, or a     \nsimple majority in compliance with applicable \nlaws. This means the closest standard to a    \nmajority of the votes cast for and against    \nsuch proposals consistent with applicable     \nlaws. This includes any existing supermajority\nvote requirement that results from default to \nstate law and can be subject to replacement.  \nThis proposal topic is important because it   \nwas approved by 99% of Capital One shares that\nvoted at an earlier Capital One Financial     \nannual meeting. This 2023 proposal includes   \nthat the Board take all the steps necessary at\nits discretion to help ensure that the topic  \nof this proposal is approved by the           \nrequirement of 80% of all outstanding shares  \nincluding a commitment to hire a proxy        \nsolicitor to conduct an intensive campaign if \nnecessary, a commitment to adjourn the annual \nmeeting to obtain the votes required if       \nnecessary and to take a 2-yearprocess to adopt\nthis proposal topic if applicable. This       \nproposal does not restrict the Board from     \nusing a means to obtain the necessary vote    \nthat is not mentioned in this proposal. For   \ninstance PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) adjourned \nits annual meeting for weeks to obtain the    \nnecessary votes on this proposal topic in 2022\nand Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX)   \nannounced a 2-yearprocess to obtain           \nshareholder approval of this proposal topic in\nits 2022 proxy. This proposal includes that   \nthe Board make an EDGAR filing approximately  \n10-daysbefore the annual meeting urging       \nshareholders to vote in favor and explaining  \nall the efforts the board has taken or will   \ntake to obtain the necessary vote and all the \navailable efforts that the Board has not taken\nwith an explanation for each available effort \nnot taken. It is important to make an all-    \nouteffort now to obtain shareholder approval  \nof this proposal topic in preference to the   \nexpense of conducting failed votes on this    \nproposal topic every year into the foreseeable\nfuture.                                       \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           147  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XV - Stockholder Proposals (Items   \n  7-9 on                                      \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nExtraordinary measures need to be taken to    \nadopt this proposal topic due to the dead hand\nof our undemocratic governance provisions that\nrequire an 80% approval from all Capital One  \nshares outstanding to improve the corporate   \ngovernance of Capital One \u2013 given the reality \nthat approximately 80% of Capital One shares  \ntypically vote at the annual meeting. Please  \nvote yes: Simple Majority Vote \u2014 Proposal 7   \nStatement in Opposition to the Stockholder    \nProposal We agree in principle that it is     \ngenerally better for voting provisions in our \ncertificate of incorporation to not require   \nsupermajority approval to pass an item.       \nIndeed, as noted in Capital One\u2019s proposal    \n(Item 2 on Proxy Card), we are proposing to   \namend Article IX of our Restated Certificate  \nof Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate\u201d) to       \nreplace the supermajority voting provisions in\nit with simple majority voting provisions.    \nAccordingly, the Board recommends that        \nstockholders vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Stockholder   \nProposal. We previously sought stockholder    \napproval at our 2013 and 2014 Annual          \nStockholder Meetings to remove the remaining  \nsupermajority provisions in our Amended and   \nRestated Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) and the        \nCertificate. In connection with those         \nmeetings, we actively solicited stockholders  \nto vote for the amendments, including engaging\ndirectly with some of our largest             \nstockholders. Stockholders approved the       \nremoval of the supermajority voting provisions\nin our Bylaws, but we did not attain the      \nrequired vote to approve the removal of       \nsupermajority voting provisions in Article IX \nof the Certificate. Article IX of the         \nCertificate has supermajority voting          \nprovisions applicable to certain business     \ncombinations between Capital One and          \nInterested Stockholders (as the term is       \ndefined in the Certificate) and requires that:\n(i) any such business combinations be approved\nby 75% of the outstanding Voting Stock        \n1(including 75% of non-InterestedStockholders)\nand (ii) an amendment of any provision of     \nArticle IX, including the supermajority voting\nprovision, be approved by 80% of the          \noutstanding Voting Stock (including 80% of    \nnon-InterestedStockholders). The key          \ndifference between management\u2019s proposal and  \nthe Stockholder Proposal is that management\u2019s \nproposal sets forth a majority voting standard\nof outstanding voting stock, while the        \nStockholder Proposal would only require a     \nmajority of the votes castat a stockholder    \nmeeting. The votes caststandard in the        \nStockholder Proposal would look at the number \nof votes cast at a stockholder meeting to     \ndetermine whether a majority of investors had \napproved a business combination between       \nCapital One and an Interested Stockholder. The\noutstanding voting stockstandard in           \nmanagement\u2019s proposal would look to all       \noutstanding Voting Stock of the Company and   \nrequire a majority of all outstanding Voting  \nStock to vote in favor of a business          \ncombination for it to be approved. Our Board  \nbelieves that management\u2019s outstanding voting \nstock standard would provide a better, more   \nequitable, and consistent result for          \nstockholders than the \u201cvotes cast\u201d standard   \nproposed in the Stockholder Proposal. Article \nIX of the Certificate pertains to business    \ncombinations between Capital One and an       \ninterested party. These matters are of great  \nsignificance to the Company and to            \nstockholders such that the will of all        \nstockholders should be considered in approving\nthese matters; not only the stockholders that \ncast votes. The outstanding voting stock      \nstandard takes into account the input of the  \nbroadest stockholder base in considering      \nsignificant matters for a company. Also, all  \nvoting provisions in the Certificate currently\nuse an outstanding voting stock standard, so  \nadopting the same standard for Article IX of  \nthe Certificate would maintain consistency    \nwith the existing voting provisions.          \n                                              \n     References in this discussion to votes   \n     of the outstanding shares and to the     \n     \u201cVoting Stock\u201d mean the Company\u2019s        \n     outstanding shares of capital stock      \n  1  entitled to vote generally in the        \n     election of directors.

Stockholder Proposal The        \nresolution being submitted by the National    \nCenter for Public Policy Research to the      \nstockholders for approval, if properly        \npresented, is as follows: Report on Ensuring  \nRespect for Civil Liberties Supporting        \nStatement:Companies that provide banking or   \nfinancial services are essential pillars of   \nthe marketplace. On account of their unique   \nand pivotal role in America\u2019s economy, many   \nfederal and state laws already prohibit them  \nfrom discriminating when providing financial  \nservices to the public. And the UN Declaration\nof Human Rights, consistent with many other   \nlaws and the U.S. Constitution, recognizes    \nthat \u201ceveryone has the right to freedom of    \nthought, conscience, and religion.\u201d 2Financial\ninstitutions should respect these freedoms. As\nshareholders of Capital One, we believe it is \nof great import that the company respect civil\nrights by identifying potential factors that  \nmay contribute to discrimination in the       \nprovision of services based on race, color,   \nreligion, sex, national origin, or social,    \npolitical, or religious views. We are         \nparticularly concerned with recent evidence of\nreligious and political discrimination by     \ncompanies in the financial services industry, \nas detailed in the Statement on Debanking and \nFree Speech. 3 When companies engage in this  \nkind of discrimination, they hinder the       \nability of individuals, groups, and businesses\nto access and equally participate in the      \nmarketplace and instead skew it to their own  \nends. The Statement on Debanking and Free     \nSpeech identified many companies in the       \nfinancial services industry that frequently   \ninclude vague and subjective standards in     \ntheir policies like \u201chate speech\u201d or promoting\n\u201cintolerance\u201d that allow employees to deny or \nrestrict service for arbitrary or             \ndiscriminatory reasons. The 2022 edition of   \nthe Viewpoint Diversity Business Index 4also  \nidentified numerous examples of this in many  \ncompanies\u2019 terms of service. The inclusion of \nvague and arbitrary terms risks impacting     \nclients\u2019 exercise of their constitutionally   \nprotected civil rights, by creating the       \npotential that such persons or groups will be \ndenied access to essential services as a      \nconsequence of their speech or political      \nactivity. Moreover, they risk giving fringe   \nactivists and governments a foothold to demand\nthat private financial institutions deny      \nservice under the sweeping, unfettered        \ndiscretion that such policies provide.        \n                                              \n  2  https://www.un.org/en/about-us/univers\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  3  https://storage.googleapis.com/vds_sto\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  4  https://viewpointdiversityscore.org/bu\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           149  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XV - Stockholder Proposals (Items   \n  7-9 on                                      \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nThese actions and policies are an affront to  \npublic trust, destabilize the market, and     \nthreaten the ability of American citizens to  \nlive freely and do business according to their\ndeeply held convictions. Capital One also     \nmaintains that it promotes good social policy \nand diversity, equity, and inclusion          \npractices. 5It is important for the           \nshareholders to know that Capital One is      \nadhering to its own standards by serving      \ndiverse consumers without regard to their     \nbeliefs or other factors above. Resolved:     \nShareholders request the Board of Directors   \nconduct an evaluation and issue a report      \nwithin the next year, at reasonable cost and  \nexcluding proprietary information and         \ndisclosure of anything that would constitute  \nan admission of pending litigation, evaluating\nhow it oversees risks related to              \ndiscrimination against individuals based on   \ntheir race, color, religion (including        \nreligious views), sex, national origin, or    \npolitical views, and whether such             \ndiscrimination may impact individuals\u2019        \nexercise of their constitutionally protected  \ncivil rights. Statement in Opposition to the  \nStockholder Proposal We believe Capital One\u2019s \npolicies and practices already provide        \neffective oversight of risks related to       \ndiscrimination against individuals.           \nAccordingly, the Board recommends that        \nstockholders vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Stockholder   \nProposal. The report and evaluation requested \nby the Stockholder Proposal are not necessary,\ngiven our existing policies and practices, and\noversight at senior levels of the             \norganization. As outlined in the Capital One  \nCode of Conduct, which is available on our    \nwebsite, unlawful discrimination is prohibited\nbased on multiple criteria, including: race,  \ncolor, national origin or citizenship; age;   \nreligion; physical or mental disability, or   \ngenetic information; sex, gender              \nidentity/reassignment or sexual orientation;  \nveteran status; marital, pregnancy or         \nmaternity status; and any other status        \nprotected by applicable law. It is our policy \nto prohibit discrimination based on these     \nfactors toward any applicant, associate, third\nparty, customer, or client. We value and      \npromote non-discriminationin every aspect of  \nour business and at every level of our        \norganization. Capital One is also committed to\nmaintaining a work environment that is free   \nfrom all forms of unlawful discrimination. We \nhave programs designed to recruit, develop,   \nand retain a diverse workforce. We also have  \nlearning programs designed to promote         \ndiversity, inclusion, and belonging (\u201cDIB\u201d)   \nawareness and strengthen our culture of       \ninclusion and belonging. We strive for pay    \nequity among our associates and periodically  \nreview groups of associates in similar roles, \naccounting for factors that appropriately     \nexplain differences in pay such as job        \nlocation and experience, and taking action to \nclose gaps where needed. The Board receives   \ndetailed reports relating to the progress and \neffectiveness of the Company\u2019s DIB efforts at \nleast annually. Our Board\u2019s skill sets,       \nexperiences and diversity, enables the Board  \nto provide comprehensive and effective        \noversight of DIB efforts and practices.       \nCapital One currently reports on the status   \nand outcomes of our robust diversity and      \ninclusion initiatives publicly, which are part\nof our anti-discrimination efforts. The       \nStockholder Proposal requests an evaluation   \nand a report on the oversight of risks related\nto discrimination against individuals based on\na narrow set of criteria. Capital One\u2019s       \nworkforce and our customers represent a wide  \nrange of backgrounds, viewpoints and          \nexperiences. We are committed to empower our  \nassociates to do great work by creating a     \nculture that values diverse perspectives,     \nfosters collaboration and encourages          \ninnovative ideas. Our anti-discrimination     \nefforts are core values that are reflected in \nexisting publicly disclosed reports and       \ndisclosures, such as our Code of Conduct, DIB \nReport, and Environmental, Social, and        \nGovernance (\u201cESG\u201d) Report, as well as other   \nemployment policies and training, which are   \nperiodically reviewed and updated, as         \nappropriate.

Through  \nthe DIB Report and ESG Report, Capital One    \nactively assesses and makes information       \navailable on its evaluation of the ways that  \nthe Company promotes diversity and inclusion  \nboth within and outside the Company. Given our\nexisting policies and practices and public    \nreporting, the Board views the Stockholder    \nProposal as unnecessary and not in the best   \ninterests of stockholders. *** The Board      \nunanimously recommends that you vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d\nthe Stockholder Proposal Requesting a Report  \nof Board Oversight of Risks Relating to       \nDiscrimination (Item 8 on Proxy Card).        \nStockholder Proposal Requesting a Board Skills\nand Diversity Matrix (Item 9 on Proxy Card)   \nCapital One has been notified that the        \nComptroller of the City of New York, One      \nCentre Street, 8th Floor North, New York, NY  \n10007, intends to present a proposal for      \nconsideration at the 2023 Annual Stockholder  \nMeeting (\u201cStockholder Proposal\u201d) on behalf of \nand as the custodian and trustee of the New   \nYork City Employees\u2019 Retirement System, the   \nNew York City Teachers\u2019 Retirement Systems,   \nand the New York Board of Education Retirement\nSystem. The New York City Employees\u2019          \nRetirement System has submitted documentation \nindicating that they are the beneficial owners\nof no fewer than 195,720 shares of Capital One\ncommon stock. The New York City Teachers\u2019     \nRetirement Systems has submitted documentation\nindicating that they are the beneficial owners\nof no fewer than 214,211 shares of Capital One\ncommon stock. The New York City Board of      \nEducation Retirement System has submitted     \ndocumentation indicating that they are the    \nbeneficial owners of no fewer than 17,135     \nshares of Capital One common stock.           \nStockholder Proposal The resolution being     \nsubmitted by the Comptroller of the City of   \nNew York to the stockholders for approval, if \nproperly presented, is as follows: Board      \nMatrix Proposal RESOLVED: Shareholders of     \nCapital One Financial Corporation (\u201cCompany\u201d) \nrequest that its Board of Directors (the      \n\u201cBoard\u201d) disclose in its annual proxy         \nstatement eachdirector/nominee\u2019s self-        \nidentified gender and race/ethnicity, as well \nas the skills and attributes that are most    \nrelevant in light of the Company\u2019s overall    \nbusiness, long-term strategy, and risks. The  \nrequested information shall be presented in   \nmatrix format and shall not include any       \nattributes the Board identifies as minimum    \nqualifications for all director candidates    \n(the \u201cBoard Matrix\u201d). SUPPORTING STATEMENT    \nInvestors believe that a diverse board \u2014 in   \nterms of relevant skills, gender, and         \nrace/ethnicity \u2014 is an indicator of a well-   \nfunctioning board. Among other benefits,      \ndiverse boards can better manage risk by      \navoiding groupthink. Capital One Financial    \nCorporation\u2019s Board sets the tone from the    \ntop, and the disclosure of a Board Matrix     \nwould signal to your employees, customers,    \nsuppliers, and investors that the directors   \nthemselves value diversity and inclusionin the\nboardroom. Many institutional investors       \nprioritize board diversity in their proxy     \nvoting guidelines and engagement initiatives. \nSignificant time and resources must be spent  \nby investors to ascertain director information\nfrom ambiguous, and aggregate company         \ndisclosures or they must rely on data         \nproviders, which also draw from the same,     \nimprecise sources. As a result, it can be     \nunnecessarily challenging for investors to    \nfulfill their fiduciary duties and vote       \naccording to their own proxy voting           \nguidelines.                                   \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           151  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XV - Stockholder Proposals (Items   \n  7-9 on                                      \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nMoreover, in its 2022 proxy statement, Capital\nOne Financial Corporation provides no         \nparticularized data with respect to how its   \ndirectors\u2019 individual qualifications fit      \ntogether to effectively fulfill the Board\u2019s   \noversight responsibilities. Nor is each       \ndirector\u2019s self-identified race/ethnicity     \nexplicitly disclosed. A Board Matrix would    \nenable investors to make better informed proxy\nvoting decisions by providing them with       \nconsistent, comparable and accurate data      \nconcerning the Company\u2019s directors in a       \nstructured and decision-usefulformat. Such    \ninformation would enable investors to: (1)    \nassess how well-suited individual director    \nnominees are for the Company in light of its  \nlong-term business strategy and risks,        \nincluding the overall mix of director         \nattributes and skills; (2) identify any gaps  \nin skills or attributes; and (3) make         \nmeaningful, year-over-year comparisons of the \nBoard\u2019s composition; and (4) ascertain the    \nself-identified gender, race/ethnicity, skills\nand attributes of any particular director who \nhas assumed leadership roles on the           \nboard/committees, as well as his/her/their    \ntenure. The proposal neither prevents nor     \ndiscourages the Company from disclosing any   \nother data or information that the Board      \nbelieves is relevant. Other leading companies,\nsuch as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and    \nJPMorgan Chase, have published a Board Matrix \nwith individualized director data in a        \ndecision-useful format. These matrices use    \nEEO-1categories for disclosing the diversity  \nof individual directors, which allows for     \nconsistent and comparable data. We urge       \nshareholders to vote FOR this proposal.       \nStatement in Opposition to the Stockholder    \nProposal The Board opposes this proposal      \nbecause we believe it is unnecessary in light \nof the disclosures regarding our Board        \nincluded in the Corporate Governance Section  \nof this 2023 Proxy Statement. Accordingly, the\nBoard recommends that stockholders vote       \n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Stockholder Proposal. We have   \nenhanced the disclosures in this proxy        \nstatement to include a detailed directors\u2019    \nskills matrix. We added a board skills matrix \non page 22 of this proxy statement to allow   \nstockholders to quickly assess each individual\ndirector\u2019s qualifications, skills and         \nexperience, age, tenure, independence and     \nservice on other public company boards (the   \n\u201cSkills Matrix\u201d). The Board believes that the \nSkills Matrix substantially provides the      \nskills-related information requested by the   \nproponent, as the qualifications and skills   \noutlined in the Skills Matrix represent the   \nskills that are most relevant to fulfill the  \nBoard\u2019s oversight responsibilities in light of\nthe Company\u2019s business, strategy and risk     \nmanagement. The data and the structured format\nof the Skills Matrix adds to the information  \nwe have historically provided regarding our   \nBoard composition, which includes disclosure  \nof the qualifications and competencies sought \nby the Board for service as directors, and a  \ndescription of how diversity attributes such  \nas gender, race and ethnicity, along with     \ndiversity of skills and experience, fit into  \nthe candidate search process. We disclose the \ndiversity of our Board with respect to gender \nand race/ethnicity on an aggregate basis,     \nwhich are key aspects of the collective       \ndiversity of our Board and responsive to      \nstockholder expectations. We believe this     \ndisclosure approach appropriately helps       \ninvestors assess the diversity of our Board   \nbased on each directors\u2019 self-identified      \ngender and race/ethnicity. We believe in      \nhaving a Board with diversity across a number \nof dimensions, including gender and           \nrace/ethnicity. We have been successful in    \nattracting exceptional, diverse individuals to\nserve on our Board. Currently, the Board is   \n50% diverse (total diversity), with three     \nwomen and three racially/ethnically diverse   \ndirectors. In addition, six new directors were\nadded to the Board within the past five years,\nfive of whom were women or racial/ethnic      \nminorities. We also believe a diversity matrix\nhas potential downsides that currently        \noutweigh any benefits. The Board acts as a    \ncollective body, representing the interests of\nall stockholders. And while individual        \ndirectors leverage their own experience and   \nknowledge in making judgments, Board decisions\nand perspectives reflect the collective wisdom\nof the group. Implementing a prescriptive     \nmatrix of individual directors\u2019 gender, racial\nand ethnic diversity could                    \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  152    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XV - Stockholder Proposals (Items   \n  7-9 on                                      \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \npotentially mislead stockholders and          \nstakeholders into wrongly believing that only \na subset of directors represent the Board on  \nparticular matters. A diversity matrix can    \nalso place undue pressure on individual       \ndirectors to make public their gender, racial \nand ethnic identities, which can be a deeply  \npersonal choice. Finally, a diversity matrix  \ncan promote a check-the-boxapproach to Board  \nrefreshment, thus increasing the risk of      \nbypassing well-qualified candidates. Our      \ndisclosures, including the enhancements       \nmentioned above, demonstrate the collective   \nstrength of our Board and meaningfully        \naddresses the Stockholder Proposal.           \nAccordingly, the Board views the Stockholder  \nProposal as unnecessary and unanimously       \nrecommends that stockholders vote against this\nproposal. *** The Board unanimously recommends\nthat you vote \u201cAGAINST\u201d the Stockholder       \nProposal Requesting a Board Skills and        \nDiversity Matrix (Item 9 on Proxy Card).      \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2023\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           153  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                 \n  OTHER MATTERS  \n                 \nSection XVI - Other Business Other Business As\nof the date of this proxy statement, we know  \nof no business that will be presented for     \nconsideration at the 2023 Annual Stockholder  \nMeeting other than the items referred to      \nabove.

While\ncertain of our non-GAAPmeasures are widely    \nused by investors, analysts, and bank         \nregulatory agencies to assess the capital     \nposition of financial services companies, they\nmay not be comparable to similarly-titled     \nmeasures reported by other companies.
