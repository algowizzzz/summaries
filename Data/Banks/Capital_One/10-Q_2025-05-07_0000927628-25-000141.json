The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a business segment are\nincluded in the Other category, such as the\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio and asset/liability positions\nperformed by our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group and any residual tax expense or\nbenefit beyond what is assessed to our\nbusiness segments in order to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate. The Other\ncategory also includes unallocated corporate\nexpenses that do not directly support the\noperations of the business segments or for\nwhich the business segments are not considered\nfinancially accountable in evaluating their\nperformance, such as certain restructuring\ncharges and integration expenses related to\nthe Transaction.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenues and expenses directly\nor indirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process is managed by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and provides a funds\ncredit for sources of funds, such as deposits\ngenerated by our Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking businesses, and a charge\nfor the use of funds by each business segment.\nThe allocation is unique to each business\nsegment and acquired business and is based on\nthe composition of assets and liabilities. The\nfunds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and\noff-balance sheet products. Periodically, the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the\nfunds transfer pricing process are adjusted to\nreflect economic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the business segments. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

There is no comprehensive\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore,\nthe managed presentation of our business\nsegment results may not be comparable to\nsimilar information provided by other\nfinancial services companies.

In addition,\nwe must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of\n4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage\nratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the\ncapital conservation buffer requirement and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement,\neach as described below. Our capital and\nleverage ratios are calculated based on the\nBasel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of\naccumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our regulatory capital as\npermitted for a Category III institution.

Under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s final rule to implement the\nstress capital buffer requirement (\u201cStress\nCapital Buffer Rule\u201d), the Company\u2019s\n\u201cstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer\u201d includes its stress capital buffer\nrequirement (as described below), any G-SIB\nSurcharge (which is not applicable to us) and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%). Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Reserve sets\nan earlier effective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is recalibrated every year based\non the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults. In particular, the Company\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement equals, subject to\na floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference\nbetween the Company\u2019s starting CET1 capital\nratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital\nratio under the severely adverse scenario of\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test\nplus (ii) the ratio of the Company\u2019s projected\nfour quarters of common stock dividends (for\nthe fourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the Company\u2019s\nprojected CET1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2024 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025 is\n5.5%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements\n                                              \n  31    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nplus the standardized approach capital\nconservation buffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital and total capital ratios under the\nstress capital buffer framework are 10.0%,\n11.5% and 13.5%, respe ctively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2024 through September 30,\n2025 . For additional information regarding a\nproposed rulemaking to modify the stress\ncapital buffer framework, including the\nrecalibration and annual effective date of the\nstress capital buffer requirement, see \u201c\nSupervision and Regulation \u2014Capital and Stress\nTesting Regulation Update\u201d in this Report.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC\u2019s capital\nregulations, which are only applicable to the\nBank, the capital conservation buffer for the\nBank continues to be fixed at 2.5%. Therefore,\nthe Bank\u2019s minimum capital requirements plus\nits capital conservation buffer for CET1\ncapital, Tier 1 capital and total capital\nratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain\nits capital ratios above the minimum capital\nrequirements plus the applicable capital\nconservation buffers, it will face\nincreasingly strict automatic limitations on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, the Company and the Bank each\nexceeded the minimum capital requirements and\nthe capital conservation buffer requirements\napplicable to them , and the Company and the\nBank were each \u201c well-capitalized. \u201d The\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards applicable to the\nCompany are established in the Federal\nReserve\u2019s regulations, and the \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d standards applicable to the Bank\nare established in the OCC\u2019s PCA capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  Market Risk Rule                            \n                                              \nThe \u201cMarket Risk Rule\u201d supplements the Basel\nIII Capital Rules by requiring institutions\nsubject to the rule to adjust their risk-based\ncapital ratios to reflect the market risk in\ntheir trading book. The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more.

The Board authorized stock\nrepurchase program does not include specific\nprice targets, may be executed through open\nmarket purchases, tender offers, or privately\nnegotiated transactions, including utilizing\nRule 10b5-1 programs, does not have a set\nexpiration date and may be suspended at any\ntime.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 20 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024.\n                                              \n  Table 20: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            March 31,        December     \n  portfoli\u2026          2025        31, 2024     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater              69  %           69  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or               31              31     \n  below                                       \n  Total               100  %          100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater              53  %           54  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660            19              19     \n  620 or               28              27     \n  below                                       \n  Total               100  %          100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory. Domestic Card credit scores\ngenerally represent Fair Isaac Corporation\n(\u201cFICO\u201d) scores. These scores are obtained\nfrom one of the major credit bureaus at\norigination and are refreshed monthly\nthereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit\nscores to comparable FICO scores for\nconsistency purposes. Balances for which no\ncredit score is available or the credit score\nis invalid are included in the 660 or below\ncategory.\n\n(2) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory. Auto credit scores generally\nrepresent average FICO scores obtained from\nthree credit bureaus at the time of\napplication and are not refreshed thereafter.\nBalances for which no credit score is\navailable or the credit score is invalid are\nincluded in the 620 or below category.\n\nIn our commercial loan portfolio, we assign\ninternal risk ratings to loans based on\nrelevant information about the ability of the\nborrowers to repay their debt. In determining\nthe risk rating of a particular loan, some of\nthe factors considered are the borrower\u2019s\ncurrent financial condition, historical and\nprojected future credit performance, prospects\nfor support from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\n\nWe present information in the section below on\nthe credit performance of our loan portfolio,\nincluding the key metrics we use in tracking\nchanges in the credit quality of our loan\nportfolio.

Our\n30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans\nheld for investment that are 30 or more days\npast due, whereas our 30+ day performing\ndelinquency metrics include all loans held for\ninvestment that are 30 or more days past due\nbut are currently classified as performing and\naccruing interest.

For our\nCommercial Banking customers, loan\nmodifications are also considered in the\nassignment of an internal risk rating.\n\nIn our Credit Card business, the majority of\nour FDMs receive an interest rate reduction\nand are placed on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months. If the customer does not\ncomply with the modified payment terms, then\nthe credit card loan agreement may revert to\nits original payment terms, generally\nresulting in any loan outstanding being\nreflected in the appropriate delinquency\ncategory and charged off in accordance with\nour standard charge-off policy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our FDMs receive an extension, an interest\nrate reduction, principal reduction, or a\ncombination of these modifications.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of our FDMs receive an extension. A\nportion of FDMs receive an interest rate\nreduction, principal reduction, or a\ncombination of modifications.\nFor more information on FDMs, see \u201cItem 1.\nFinancial Statements\u2014Note 4\u2014Loans.\u201d\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. We also estimate expected credit\nlosses related to unfunded lending commitments\nthat are not unconditionally cancellable. The\nprovision for losses on unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in the provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income and the related reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments is included in other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets.

We are exposed to\nmarket risk primarily from the following\noperations and activities:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of deposit\ngathering and lending;\n\n\u2022 Asset/liability management activities\nincluding the management of investment\nsecurities, short-term and long-term\nborrowings and derivatives;\n\n\u2022 Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada\nwithin our Credit Card business; and\n\n\u2022 Customer accommodation activities within our\nCommercial Banking business.\n\nWe have enterprise-wide risk management\npolicies and limits, approved by our Board of\nDirectors, which govern our market risk\nmanagement activities. Our objective is to\nmanage our exposure to market risk in\naccordance with these policies and limits\nbased on prevailing market conditions and\nlong-term expectations. We provide additional\ninformation below about our primary sources of\nmarket risk, our market risk management\nstrategies and the measures that we use to\nevaluate these exposures.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Risk                          \n                                              \nInterest rate risk represents exposure to\nfinancial instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest rates. We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or repricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments which could\ninclude caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts.\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact of hypothetical\ninstantaneous movements in interest rates\nrelative to our baseline interest rate\nforecast on our projected 12-month net\ninterest income. Net interest income\nsensitivity metrics are derived using the\nfollowing key assumptions:\n\n\u2022 As of March 31, 2025, our metrics assume a\nmarket implied baseline interest rate\nprojection for the upper limit of the Federal\nFunds Target Rate of 3.75% and 3.50% at\nDecember 31, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\n\u2022 In addition to our existing assets,\nliabilities and derivative positions, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions. These assumptions include loan\nand deposit growth, pricing, plans for\nprojected changes in our funding mix and our\nsecurities and cash position from our internal\ncorporate outlook that is used in our\nfinancial planning process.\n\n\u2022 The analysis assumes this forecast of\nexpected future business growth remains\nunchanged between the baseline rate forecast\nand rate shock scenarios, including no changes\nto our interest rate risk management\nactivities like securities and hedging\nactions.\n\n\u2022 We incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit\nre-pricing, which includes pricing lags and\nchanges in deposit beta and mix as interest\nrates change, and the prepayment sensitivity\nof our mortgage securities to the level of\ninterest rates. In our models, deposit betas\nand mortgage security prepayments vary\ndynamically based on the level of interest\nrates and by product type. In the contexts\nused in this section, \u201cbeta\u201d refers to the\nchange in deposit rate paid relative to the\nchange in the federal funds rate.\n\n\u2022 In instances where an interest rate scenario\nwould result in a rate less th an 0%, we\nassume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This\nassumption applies only to jurisdictions that\ndo not have a practice of employing negative\npolicy rates. In jurisdictions that have\nnegative policy rates, we do not floor\ninterest rates a t 0%.\n                                              \n  56    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAt the current level of interest rates, our\nprojected 12-month net interest income is\nexpected to increase in higher rate scenarios\nand decrease in lower rate scenarios. The\ndecrease in lower rate scenarios is driven by\nlower interest income from our assets,\nincluding floating rate credit card and\ncommercial loans, being partially offset by\nlower interest expense from our deposits and\nother liabilities, net of our interest rate\nhedges. Our 12-month net interest income\nsensitivity was largely unchanged as compared\nto December 31, 2024.\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity        \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact of hypothetical\ninstantaneous movements in interest rates on\nthe net present value of our assets and\nliabilities, including derivative exposures.\nEconomic value of equity sensitivity metrics\nare derived using the following key\nassumptions:\n\n\u2022 As of March 31, 2025, our metrics assume a\nmarket implied baseline interest rate\nprojection for the upper limit of the Federal\nFunds Target Rate of 3.75% and 3.50% at\nDecember 31, 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\n\u2022 The analysis includes only existing assets,\nliabilities and derivative positions and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes.\n\n\u2022 Similar to our net interest income\nsensitivity measure, we incorporate the\ndynamic nature of deposit repricing and\nattrition, which includes pricing lags and\nchanges in deposit beta as interest rates\nchange and the prepayment sensitivity of our\nmortgage securities to the level of interest\nrates. In our models, deposit betas and\nmortgage security prepayments vary dynamically\nbased on the level of interest rates and by\nproduct type.\n\n\u2022 Balance attrition assumptions for loans,\nincluding credit card, auto and commercial\nloans, remain unchanged between the baseline\ninterest rate forecast and interest rate shock\nscenarios as those loans are mainly floating\nrate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and\nhence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the\nlevel of interest rates.\n\n\u2022 For assets and liabilities with embedded\noptionality, such as mortgage securities and\ndeposit balances, we utilize Monte Carlo\nsimulations to assess economic value with\nindustry-standard term structure modeling of\ninterest rates.\n\n\u2022 Our calculations of net present value apply\nappropriate spreads over the benchmark yield\ncurve for select assets and liabilities to\ncapture the inherent risks (including credit\nrisk) to discount expected interest and\nprincipal cash flows.\n\n\u2022 In instances where an interest rate scenario\nwould result in a rate less than 0%, we assume\na rate of 0% for that scenario. This\nassumption applies only to jurisdictions that\ndo not have a practice of employing negative\npolicy rates. In jurisdictions that have\nnegative policy rates, we do not floor\ninterest rates at 0%.\n\nOur current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity decreases in higher\ninterest rate scenarios and increases in lower\ninterest rate scenarios. The decrease in\nhigher rate scenarios is due to the declines\nin the projected value of our fixed rate\nassets being only partially offset by\ncorresponding movements in the projected value\nof our deposits and other liabilities. The\npace of economic value of equity decrease is\nlarger for the +200 bps scenario as our\ndeposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly\nin higher interest rate environments. Our\ncurrent economic value of equity sensitivity\nwas largely unchanged for higher rate\nscenarios and decreased modestly for lower\nrate scenarios as compared to December 31,\n2024.\n                                              \n  57    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 31 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand our current economic value of equity\ncalculated under the methodology described\nabove as of March 31, 2025 and December 31,\n2024.\n                                              \n   Table 31: Interest Rate Sensitivity        \n   Analysis                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n                March 31,        December     \n                     2025        31, 2024     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  projected                                   \n  baseline                                    \n  net                                         \n  interest                                    \n  income:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis               1.5  %          1.3  %  \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis               0.9             0.8     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis           0.5             0.4     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis          -0.4            -0.4     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis              -0.9            -0.8     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis              -2.1            -1.9     \n  points                                      \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  economic                                    \n  value of                                    \n  equity:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis              -6.3            -6.3     \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis              -2.9            -3.0     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis          -1.4            -1.4     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis           1.2             1.3     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis               2.2             2.5     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis               3.0             3.9     \n  points                                      \n                                              \nIn addition to these industry standard\nmeasures, we also consider the potential\nimpact of alternative interest rate scenarios,\nsuch as larger rate shocks, higher than +/-\n200 bps, as well as steepening and flattening\nyield curve scenarios in our internal interest\nrate risk management decisions. We also\nregularly review the sensitivity of our\ninterest rate risk metrics to changes in our\nkey modeling assumptions, such as our loan and\ndeposit balance forecasts, mortgage\nprepayments and deposit repricing.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments. Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on our existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cPart I\u2014Item 1.

We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nnominal intercompany funding outstanding was\n1.2 billion GBP and 1.3 billion GBP as of\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, and 1.2 billion CAD and 1.4\nbillion CAD as of March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, respectively. Our nominal EUR-\ndenominated borrowings outstanding were 507\nmillion EUR and 505 million EUR as of March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet and\ncapital ratios to translation risk in AOCI. We\nmanage our translation risk by entering into\nforeign currency derivatives designated as net\ninvestment hedges. We measure these exposures\nby applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation\nshock, which we believe approximates a\nsignificant adverse shock over a one-year time\nhorizon, against the value of the equity\ninvested in our foreign operations net of\nrelated net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 2.3 billion\nGBP and 2.2 billion GBP as of March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, respectively, and 2.6\nbillion CAD as of both March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.

We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99%\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day. As a result of offsetting our\ncustomer exposures with other counterparties,\nwe believe that our net exposure to market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivatives\nis minimal.

We therefore generally\nmanage credit risk based on portfolios with\ncommon risk characteristics. The risk in our\ncredit card loan portfolio correlates to broad\neconomic trends, such as the U.S. unemployment\nrate and U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product\n(\u201cGDP\u201d) growth rate, as well as consumers\u2019\nfinancial condition, all of which can have a\nmaterial effect on credit performance. The key\nindicator we assess in monitoring the credit\nquality and risk of our credit card loan\nportfolio is delinquency trends, including an\nanalysis of loan migration between delinquency\ncategories over time.\nThe table below presents our credit card\nportfolio by delinquency status as of March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nTable 4.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  86    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nConsumer Banking\nOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists\nof auto and retail banking loans.

We present our auto\nloan portfolio by Fair Isaac Corporation\n(\u201cFICO\u201d) scores at origination and our retail\nbanking loan portfolio by delinquency status,\nwhich includes all past due loans, both\nperforming and nonperforming.\nTable 4.4: Consumer Banking Portfolio by\nVintage Year\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  87    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Amounts represent period-end loans held\nfor investment in each credit score category.\nAuto credit scores generally represent average\nFICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus\nat the time of application and are not\nrefreshed thereafter.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses. Generally, loans that are\ndesignated as criticized performing and\ncriticized nonperforming are reviewed\nquarterly by management to determine if they\nare appropriately classified/rated and whether\nany impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are\ngenerally reviewed, at least annually, to\ndetermine the appropriate risk rating. In\naddition, we evaluate the risk rating during\nthe renewal process of any loan or if a loan\nbecomes past due.\n\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024. The internal risk\nrating status includes all past due loans,\nboth performing and nonperforming.\nTable 4.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by\nInternal Risk Ratings\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  89    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Criticized exposures correspond to the\n\u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d and\n\u201cDoubtful\u201d asset categories defined by bank\nregulatory authorities.\n                                              \n  90    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nFinancial Difficulty Modifications to\nBorrowers\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (one to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectibility of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications when estimating the credit\nquality of our loan portfolio and establishing\nallowance levels.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. Significant judgment is applied in\nour estimation of lifetime credit losses. When\ndeveloping an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectibility. This may include internal\ninformation, external information, or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Our estimate of\nexpected credit losses includes a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period of one year\nand then reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses at each relevant loss\ncomponent of the estimate. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income. The related\nreserve for unfunded lending commitments is\nincluded in other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

The expected reimbursements\nfrom these partners are netted against our\nallowance for credit losses. Our methodology\nfor estimating reimbursements is consistent\nwith the methodology we use to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on our credit card\nloan receivables. These expected\nreimbursements result in reductions in net\ncharge-offs and the provision for credit\nlosses. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which provide a source of funding for\nus and enable us to transfer a certain portion\nof the economic risk of the loans or related\ndebt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet the maximum amount of any remaining\nfunding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. We\nseparately present information for\nconsolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 6.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  9\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       2\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       75       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026        9       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       84       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  100    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       3\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       75       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026        9       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       84       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities of the VIE, which includes the\nseller\u2019s interest and repurchased notes held\nby other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which holds as its primary\nasset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE.\nIn these instances, we disclose the carrying\namount of assets and liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets as unconsolidated\nVIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the\nunconsolidated VIEs are generally the\noperating entities generating the exposure.\nThe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nincluded in the unconsolidated VIE columns\nabove related to these investment structures\nwere $ 2.6billion of assets and $ 958million\nof liabilities as of March 31, 2025, and $\n2.7billion of assets and $ 1.0billion of\nliabilities as of December 31, 2024.\n\n(4) Primarily consists of variable interests\nin companies that promote renewable energy\nsources and other equity method investments.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests. We also engage in\nsecuritization-related activity in our\nmultifamily agency business, where we do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions.\nCredit Card and Auto Securitizations\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card\nreceivables and auto loans which provides a\nsource of funding for us. These\nsecuritizations involve the transfer of\nassets, credit card receivables and auto\nloans, into securitization trusts. These\ntrusts then issue debt securities\ncollateralized by the transferred assets to\nthird-party investors. We hold certain\nretained interests and continue to service the\nassets in these trusts. We consolidate these\ntrusts because we are deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary as we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of the trusts, and the\nright to receive benefits or the obligation to\nabsorb losses that could potentially be\nsignificant to the trusts.\n                                              \n  101    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nMultifamily Agency Securitization Activity\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to GSEs who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nmortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) and service\nthe transferred loans pursuant to the\nguidelines set forth by the GSEs. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either solely invest in securities\nissued by the VIE and were not involved in the\ndesign of the VIE or no transfers have\noccurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our\nmaximum exposure to loss as a result of our\ninvolvement with these VIEs is the carrying\nvalue of the MSRs and investment securities on\nour consolidated balance sheets as well as our\ncontractual obligations under loss sharing\narrangements. See \u201cNote 14\u2014Commitments,\nContingencies, Guarantees and Others\u201d for\ninformation about the loss sharing agreements,\n\u201cNote 7\u2014Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d\nfor information related to our MSRs associated\nwith these securitizations and \u201cNote\n3\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for more information\non the securities held in our investment\nsecurities portfolio.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties, a\nmajority of which are VIEs. We receive\naffordable housing tax credits for these\ninvestments. The activities of these entities\nare financed with a combination of invested\nequity capital and debt. We account for our\ninvestments in qualified affordable housing\nprojects using the proportional amortization\nmethod, where costs of the investment are\namortized over the period in which the\ninvestor expects to receive tax credits and\nother tax benefits, and the resulting\namortization is recognized as a component of\nincome tax expense attributable to continuing\noperations. For the three months ended March\n31, 2025 and 2024, we recognized amortization\nof $ 159million and $ 178million,\nrespectively, and tax credits of $ 153million\nand $ 184million, respectively, associated\nwith these investments within income tax\nprovision. The carrying value of our equity\ninvestments in these qualified affordable\nhousing projects was $ 5.2billion and $\n5.3billion as of March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, respectively. We are periodically\nrequired to provide additional financial or\nother support during the period of the\ninvestments. Our liability for these unfunded\ncommitments was $ 1.9billion and $ 2.1billion\nas of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, and is largely expected to be\npaid from 2025 to 2028.\n\nFor those investment funds considered to be\nVIEs, we are not required to consolidate them\nif we do not have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\neconomic performance of those entities. We\nrecord our interests in these unconsolidated\nVIEs in loans held for investment, other\nassets and other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our maximum\nexposure to these entities is limited to our\nvariable interests in the entities which\nconsisted of assets of approximately $\n5.5billion as of both March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024. The creditors of the VIEs\nhave no recourse to our general credit and we\ndo not provide additional financial or other\nsupport other than during the period that we\nare contractually required to provide it. The\ntotal assets of the unconsolidated VIE\ninvestment funds were approximately $\n18.1billion as of both March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024.\n\nEntities that Provide Capital to Low-Income\nand Rural Communities\n\nWe hold variable interests in entities\n(\u201cInvestor Entities\u201d) that invest in community\ndevelopment entities (\u201cCDEs\u201d) that provide\ndebt financing to businesses and non-profit\nentities in low-income and rural communities.\nVariable interests in the CDEs held by the\nconsolidated Investor Entities are also our\nvariable interests. The activities of the\nInvestor Entities are financed with a\ncombination of invested equity capital and\ndebt. The activities of the CDEs are financed\nsolely with invested equity capital. We\nreceive federal and state tax credits for\nthese investments. We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest. The assets of the VIEs\nthat we consolidated, which totaled\napproximately $ 2.8billion and $ 2.6billion as\nof March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, are reflected on our\nconsolidated balance sheets in cash, loans\nheld for investment, and other assets. The\nliabilities are reflected in other\nliabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no\nrecourse to our general credit. We have not\nprovided additional financial or other support\nother than during the period that we are\ncontractually required to provide it.\n                                              \n  102    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nOther\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs,\nincluding companies that promote renewable\nenergy sources and other equity method\ninvestments. We are not required to\nconsolidate these VIEs because we do not have\nthe power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact their economic\nperformance.

Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging certain exposures denominated in\nforeign currencies. We primarily use interest\nrate and foreign currency swaps to perform\nthese hedging activities, but we may also use\na variety of other derivative instruments,\nincluding caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts, to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks. We designate these\nrisk management derivatives as either\nqualifying accounting hedges or free-standing\nderivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are\nfurther designated as fair value hedges, cash\nflow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-\nstanding derivatives are economic hedges that\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting.\nWe offer interest rate, commodity, foreign\ncurrency derivatives and other contracts as an\naccommodation to our customers within our\nCommercial Banking business. We enter into\nthese derivatives with our customers primarily\nto help them manage their interest rate risks,\nhedge their energy and other commodities\nexposures, and manage foreign currency\nfluctuations. We offset the substantial\nmajority of the market risk exposure of our\ncustomer accommodation derivatives through\nderivative transactions with other\ncounterparties.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. We enter into receive-fixed, pay-float\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed rate debt and\ndeposits due to fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed,\nreceive-float interest rate swaps to hedge\nchanges in the fair value of fixed rate\ninvestment securities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the hedged forecasted\ntransactions impact earnings and presented in\nthe same line item in our consolidated\nstatements of income as the earnings effect of\nthe hedged items. We enter into receive-fixed,\npay-float interest rate swaps and interest\nrate floors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated credit card and\ncommercial loans from floating to fixed in\norder to reduce the impact of changes in\nforecasted future cash flows due to\nfluctuations in market interest rates. We also\nenter into foreign currency forward contracts\nto hedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  106    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that stems from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in over-the-\ncounter (\u201cOTC\u201d) markets. We also execute\ninterest rate and commodity futures in the\nexchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC\nderivatives consist of both trades cleared\nthrough central counterparty clearinghouses\n(\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared bilateral contracts.\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the\nIntercontinental Exchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH\nGroup (\u201cLCH\u201d) are our CCPs for our centrally\ncleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral\ncontracts, we enter into agreements directly\nwith our derivative counterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements, where applicable, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. We exchange collateral in\ntwo primary forms: variation margin, which\naccounts for changes in market value due to\ndaily market movements, and initial margin,\nwhich offsets the potential future exposure of\na derivative. We exchange variation margin and\ninitial margin on bilateral derivatives in\nscope for uncleared margin rules.\n\nThe amount of collateral exchanged for\nvariation margin is dependent upon the fair\nvalue of the derivative instruments as well as\nthe fair value of the pledged collateral and\nwill vary over time as market variables\nchange. The amount of the initial margin\nexchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation\nof initial margin exposure, as prescribed by\n1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators\u2019 margin\nrules for uncleared derivatives (\u201cPR Rules\u201d)\nor 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and\n2) the fair value of the pledged collateral;\nit will vary over time as market variables\nchange. When valuing collateral, an estimate\nof the variation in price and liquidity over\ntime is subtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d\nto discount the value of the collateral\npledged. Our exposure to derivative\ncounterparty credit risk, at any point in\ntime, is equal to the amount reported as a\nderivative asset on our balance sheet. The\nfair value of our derivatives is adjusted on\nan aggregate basis to take into consideration\nthe effects of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and any associated\ncollateral received or pledged. See Table 9.3\nfor our net exposure associated with\nderivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. We also clear exchange-traded\ninstruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures\ncommission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the\nintermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require\nthat we post initial and variation margin\nthrough our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-\npayment or default. Initial margin is required\nby CCPs as collateral against potential losses\non our exchange-traded and cleared derivative\ncontracts and variation margin is exchanged on\na daily basis to account for mark-to-market\nchanges in those derivative contracts. For\nCME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives,\nvariation margin cash payments are required to\nbe characterized as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with bilateral derivative\ncounterparties, where applicable, to mitigate\nthe risk of default. These bilateral\nagreements typically provide the right to\noffset exposure with the same counterparty and\nrequire the party in a net liability position\nto post collateral. Agreements with certain\nbilateral counterparties require both parties\nto maintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of uncleared derivatives exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\n                                              \n  107    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty.

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n  Level\u00a03:    observable in the market.       \n              Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow methodologies or      \n              similar techniques.             \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nWe consider all available information,\nincluding observable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and\nsignificant inputs. Based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or\ninstrument category, judgments are made\nregarding the significance of the observable\nor unobservable inputs to the instruments\u2019\nfair value measurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. The\naccounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nThe determination and classification of\nfinancial instruments in the fair value\nhierarchy is performed at the end of each\nreporting period.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity or\ncredit spreads, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. In\naddition, an increase in default rates would\ngenerally be accompanied by a decrease in\nrecovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an\nincrease in liquidity spreads, and would lead\nto a decrease in the fair value measurement.\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasureme nts\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments. Certain activities that are not part\nof a business segment are included in the\nOther category, such as the management of our\ncorporate investment portfolio and\nasset/liability positions performed by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group and any\nresidual tax expense or benefit beyond what is\nassessed to our business segments in order to\narrive at the consolidated effective tax rate.\nThe Other category also includes unallocated\ncorporate expenses that do not directly\nsupport the operations of the business\nsegments or for which the business segments\nare not considered financially accountable in\nevaluating their performance, such as certain\nrestructuring charges and integration expenses\nrelated to the Transaction.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources. The\nChief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) for\neach of our segments is the Chief Executive\nOfficer (\u201cCEO\u201d). The CODM uses the segments\u2019\nincome (loss) from continuing operations after\ntax to assess segment performance and decide\nhow to allocate resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenues and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Marketing expenses are\nincluded within non-interest expense and can\nbe directly incurred by a business segment or\nindirectly incurred and allocated. Total\nmarketing expense was $ 1.2billion and $\n1.0billion for the three months ended March\n31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Credit Card\nmarketing expense was $ 1.0billion and $\n884million for the three months ended March\n31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our funds\ntransfer pricing process managed by our\ncentralized Corporate Treasury group provides\na funds credit for sources of funds, such as\ndeposits generated by our Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking businesses, and a charge\nfor the use of funds by each business segment.\nThe allocation is unique to each business\nsegment and acquired business and is based on\nthe composition of assets and liabilities. The\nfunds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and\noff-balance sheet products. Periodically the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the\nfunds transfer pricing process are adjusted to\nreflect economic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the business segments. Due\nto the integrated nature of our business\nsegments, estimates and judgments have been\nmade in allocating certain revenue and expense\nitems. Transactions between segments are based\non specific criteria or approximate market\nrates. We regularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods. We provide\nadditional information on the allocation\nmethodologies used to derive our business\nsegment results in \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as automated teller\nmachine (\u201cATM\u201d) usage. Service charges and\nother customer-related fees within our\nCommercial Banking business are mostly related\nto fees earned on treasury management and\ncapital markets services.

The contractual\namount of these commitments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to us should the\ncounterparty draw upon the commitment. We\ngenerally manage the potential risk of\nunfunded lending commitments by limiting the\ntotal amount of arrangements, monitoring the\nsize and maturity structure of these\nportfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024. The carrying value\nrepresents our reserve and deferred revenue on\nlegally binding commitments.\nTable 14.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments\n                                              \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n          \u2026                \u2026                  \n  \u2026       \u2026       D\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       3\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026          N\u2026          N\u2026  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       4\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026           \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026    $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026        $  \u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n__________\n(1) Includes $ 6.0billion of advised lines of\ncredit as of both March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024.\n(2) These financial guarantees have expiration\ndates that range from 2025 to 2027 as of March\n31, 2025.\nLoss Sharing Agreements\nWithin our Commercial Banking business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans with the intent to sell them to the\nGSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements\nwith the GSEs upon the sale of these\noriginated loans. Beginning January 1, 2020,\nwe elected the fair value option on new loss\nsharing agreements entered into. Unrealized\ngains and losses are recorded in other non-\ninterest income in our consolidated statements\nof income. For those loss sharing agreements\nentered into as of and prior to December 31,\n2019, we amortize the liability recorded at\ninception into non-interest income as we are\nreleased from risk of having to make a payment\nand record our estimate of expected credit\nlosses each period through the provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income. The liability recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheets for these loss\nsharing agreements was $ 139million and $\n143million as of March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, respectively. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Allowance\nfor Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded\nLending Commitments\u201d for information related\nto our credit card partnership loss sharing\narrangements.\n                                              \n  128    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nLitigation\n\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for legal and regulatory related\nmatters that arise from the ordinary course of\nour business activities when it is probable\nthat a loss associated with a claim or\nproceeding has been incurred and the amount of\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated. None of\nthe amounts we currently have recorded\nindividually or in the aggregate are\nconsidered to be material to our financial\ncondition. Litigation claims and proceedings\nof all types are subject to many uncertain\nfactors that generally cannot be predicted\nwith assurance. Below we provide a description\nof potentially material legal and regulatory\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of March\n31, 2025 are approximately $ 300million. Our\nreserve and reasonably possible loss estimates\ninvolve considerable judgment and reflect that\nthere is significant uncertainty regarding\nnumerous factors that may impact the ultimate\nloss levels. Notwithstanding our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlegal and regulatory matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and reasonably possible losses disclosed\nhere. Given the inherent uncertainties\ninvolved in these matters and the very large\nor indeterminate damages sought in some of\nthese, there is significant uncertainty as to\nthe ultimate liability we may incur from these\nlegal and regulatory matters and an adverse\noutcome in one or more of these matters could\nbe material to our results of operations or\ncash flows for any particular reporting\nperiod.\nInterchange Litigation\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. The Visa and MasterCard payment networks\nand issuing banks entered into settlement and\njudgment sharing agreements allocating the\nliabilities of any judgment or settlement\narising from all interchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement.\n\nThe monetary relief class action settled for $\n5.5billion and was approved by the District\nCourt in December 2019. The Second Circuit\naffirmed the settlement in March 2023, and it\nis final. Some of the merchants that opted out\nof the monetary relief class have brought\ncases, and some of those cases have settled\nand some remain pending. Visa created a\nlitigation escrow account following its\ninitial public offering of stock in 2008 that\nfunds the portion of these settlements\nattributable to Visa-allocated transactions.\nAny settlement amounts based on MasterCard-\nallocated transactions that have not already\nbeen paid are reflected in our reserves. Visa\nand MasterCard reached a settlement with the\ninjunctive relief class and filed a motion for\npreliminary approval, which was denied by the\nDistrict Court in June 2024. The parties will\ncontinue to litigate unless a settlement is\nreached and approved.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201c2019 Cybersecurity\nIncident\u201d). As a result of the 2019\nCybersecurity Incident, we have been subject\nto numerous legal proceedings and other\ninquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We are currently\nnamed as a defendant in 4putative consumer\nclass action cases in Canadian courts alleging\nharm from the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident and\nseeking various remedies, including monetary\nand injunctive relief. The lawsuits allege\nbreach of contract, negligence, violations of\nvarious privacy laws and a variety of other\nlegal causes of action. In the second quarter\nof 2022, a trial court in British Columbia\npreliminarily certified a class of all\nimpacted Canadian consumers except those in\nQuebec. The preliminary certification decision\nin British Columbia was appealed, with both\nparties contesting portions of the ruling. On\nJuly 4, 2024, the British Columbia Court of\nAppeal denied both parties\u2019 appeals. In the\nthird quarter of 2023, a trial court in Quebec\npreliminarily authorized a class of all\nimpacted consumers in Quebec.

The final\ntwoputative class actions, both of which are\npending in Alberta, are continuing in\nparallel, but currently remain at a\npreliminary stage.\n\nSavings Account Litigation and Related CFPB\nLitigation\n\nOn July 10, 2023, we were sued in a putative\nclass action in the Eastern District of\nVirginia by savings account holders alleging\nbreach of contract and a variety of other\ncauses of action relating to our introduction\nof a new savings account product with a higher\ninterest rate than existing savings account\nproducts (\u201cSavings Account Litigation\u201d). Since\nthe original suit, we have also been sued in\nsix similar putative class actions in federal\ncourts in California, Illinois, Ohio,\nVirginia, New Jersey and New York. On March\n20, 2024, we filed with the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation a motion to\nconsolidate and transfer related actions to\nthe Eastern District of Virginia. In June\n2024, the Judicial Panel granted the motion\nand transferred the related actions to the\nEastern District of Virginia. Plaintiffs filed\na consolidated complaint on July 1, 2024, and\nthe court set a trial date in July 2025. In\nNovember 2024, the court denied our motion to\ndismiss. In April 2025, the parties reached a\npreliminary agreement to settle the case that\nis subject to court approval.\n\nIn August 2024, we received a Civil\nInvestigative Demand from the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) relating\nto the savings account products at issue in\nthe litigation. In October 2024, the CFPB\nissued a Notice and Opportunity to Respond and\nAdvise (\u201cNORA\u201d) letter indicating that the\nCFPB was considering an enforcement action\nagainst us on similar grounds as the claims in\nthe Savings Account Litigation. On January 14,\n2025, the CFPB filed a lawsuit against Capital\nOne in the Eastern District of Virginia. On\nFebruary 27, 2025, the CFPB voluntarily\ndismissed its lawsuit against Capital One with\nprejudice.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n\nOther Contingencies\n\nDeposit Insurance Assessments\n\nOn November 16, 2023, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) finalized a\nrule to implement a special assessment to\nrecover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund\n(\u201cDIF\u201d) arising from the protection of\nuninsured depositors in connection with the\nsystemic risk determination announced on March\n12, 2023, following the closures of Silicon\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. In December\n2023, the FDIC provided notification that it\nwould be collecting the special assessment at\nan annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis\npoints (\u201cbps\u201d) over eight quarterly collection\nperiods, beginning with the first quarter of\n2024 with the first payment due on June 28,\n2024. In June 2024, the FDIC provided\nnotification that the collection period will\nbe extended an additional two quarters beyond\nthe initial eight quarterly collection\nperiods. The special assessment base is equal\nto an insured depository institution\u2019s\nestimated uninsured deposits reported on its\nConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income\nas of December 31, 2022 (\u201c2022 Call Report\u201d),\nadjusted to exclude the first $5 billion of\nuninsured deposits. We recognized $ 289million\nin operating expense in the fourth quarter of\n2023 associated with the special assessment\nbased on our 2022 Call Report, which was\nrevised and refiled during 2023. As a result\nof updates from the FDIC related to our\nportion of the FDIC\u2019s estimate of relevant DIF\nlosses, we have recognized $ 328million of\noperating expenses related to the special\nassessment as of March 31, 2025.\n\nIt is reasonably possible amendments will be\nneeded to our 2022 Call Report due to future\nlegal and regulatory developments, which could\nresult in additional expenses associated with\nthe special assessment. The ultimate amount of\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment will also be impacted by the\nfinalization of the losses incurred by the\nFDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank. The amount of reasonably\npossible additional special assessment fees\nbeyond our existing accrual due to these\nfactors is approximately $ 200million.\n                                              \n  130    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 3.
