Our Board is presenting the        \nfollowing twelve nominees for election as     \ndirectors at the 2025 Annual Stockholder      \nMeeting. Each nominee is a current Board      \nmember who was elected by stockholders at the \n2024 Annual Stockholder Meeting. Each nominee \nhas consented to serve a one-yearterm.        \nInformation about the nominees for election as\ndirectors is set forth under \u201cOur Director    \nNominees\u201d beginning on page 12. In the event a\nnominee becomes unable to serve, or for good  \ncause, will not serve as a director, the Board\nmay designate a substitute nominee or reduce  \nthe size of the Board.

When considering director  \nnominees, including incumbent directors       \nstanding for re-election,nominees to fill     \nvacancies on the Board, and nominees          \nrecommended by stockholders, the Governance   \nand Nominating Committee focuses on certain   \ncriteria when developing and evaluating the   \nBoard\u2019s composition. Among the criteria       \nconsidered, the Governance and Nominating     \nCommittee considers each director nominee\u2019s   \nrelevant skills and experience, commitment to \nthe Company, diversity of experience and      \nbackground, and relevant personal             \ncharacteristics. For more information         \nregarding our Governance and Nominating       \nCommittee\u2019s and our Board\u2019s perspectives on   \nBoard composition, recruitment priorities, and\nrefreshment, see \u201cCorporate Governance at     \nCapital One\u2014Key Board Governance Practices\u2014Our\nPerspectives on Overall Board Composition and \nRefreshment\u201d beginning on page 24. Other      \nConsiderations For new candidates, the        \nGovernance and Nominating Committee also      \nconsiders the results of the candidate\u2019s      \ninterviews with directors and/or members of   \nsenior management and any background checks   \nthe Governance and Nominating Committee deems \nappropriate. In 2024, Capital One continued   \nits engagement with Spencer Stuart, a third-  \nparty director search firm, to identify and   \nevaluate potential director candidates based  \non the criteria and principles described      \nabove. When evaluating incumbent directors,   \nthe Governance and Nominating Committee also  \nconsiders each director\u2019s performance         \nthroughout the year, including the director\u2019s \nattendance, preparation for, and participation\nin Board and committee meetings, the          \ndirector\u2019s annual evaluation, including       \nfeedback received from fellow Board members,  \nthe director\u2019s outside commitments, and the   \ndirector\u2019s willingness to serve for an        \nadditional term, as further described in the  \nsection \u201cAnnual Assessment of Individual      \nDirector Nominees\u201d on page 29.                \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  18    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section I - Election of Directors (Item 1   \n  on Proxy                                    \n  Card)                                       \n                                              \nSkills and Experience of Our Director Nominees\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee and   \nthe Board regularly review the Board\u2019s        \nmembership in light of Capital One\u2019s business \nmodel and strategic goals and objectives, the \nregulatory environment, and financial market  \nconditions. In its review, the Governance and \nNominating Committee considers whether the    \nBoard continues to possess the appropriate mix\nof skills and experience to oversee the       \nCompany in achieving these goals, and may seek\nadditional directors as a result of this      \nreview. Our director nominees have the        \nrequisite experiences that, in the aggregate, \nmeet an articulated set of director skills    \nestablished by the Governance and Nominating  \nCommittee. These skills collectively allow our\ndirector nominees to effectively oversee the  \nCompany and create an engaged, effective, and \nstrategically oriented board.

  \nCapital One Capital One is dedicated to strong\nand effective corporate governance that is    \ndesigned to provide the appropriate framework \nfor the Board to engage with and oversee the  \nmanagement of the Company. Robust and dynamic \ncorporate governance policies and practices   \nare the foundation of an effective and well-  \nfunctioning board and are vital to preserving \nthe trust of our stakeholders, including      \ncustomers, stockholders, regulators,          \nsuppliers, associates, our communities, and   \nthe general public. Information About Our     \nCorporate Governance Policies and Guidelines  \nThe Board has adopted Corporate Governance    \nGuidelines to formalize its governance        \npractices and provide its view of effective   \ngovernance. Our Corporate Governance          \nGuidelines embody many of our long-standing   \npractices, policies, and procedures, which    \ncollectively form a corporate governance      \nframework that promotes the long-term         \ninterests of our stockholders, promotes       \nresponsible decision-making and               \naccountability, and fosters a culture that    \nallows our Board and management to pursue     \nCapital One\u2019s strategic objectives. To        \nmaintain and enhance independent oversight,   \nour Board regularly reviews and refreshes its \ngovernance policies and practices in          \nconnection with changes in corporate strategy,\nthe regulatory environment, financial market  \nconditions, industry best practices, or other \nsignificant events, as well as in response to \ninvestor and other stakeholder feedback and   \nengagement. The Board has also adopted Capital\nOne\u2019s Code of Conduct, which applies to       \nCapital One\u2019s directors, executives, and      \nassociates, including Capital One\u2019s CEO, CFO, \nPrincipal Accounting Officer, Chief Risk      \nOfficers, and other associates performing     \nsimilar functions. The Code of Conduct        \nreflects Capital One\u2019s commitment to honesty, \nfair dealing, and integrity, and guides the   \nethical actions and working relationships of  \nCapital One\u2019s directors, executives, and      \nassociates.

We believe \nthat our existing Board leadership structure  \nof a combined Chairman/CEO and a Lead         \nIndependent Director provides the most        \neffective governance framework and allows our \nCompany to benefit from Mr. Fairbank\u2019s talent,\nknowledge, and leadership as the founder of   \nCapital One and allows him to use the in-depth\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            21  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nfocus and perspective gained in operating the \nCompany\u2019s day-to-dayoperations, strategic     \nplanning, and risk management to effectively  \nand efficiently lead our Board. Recognizing   \nthe importance of independent perspectives on \nthe Board, Capital One appropriately maintains\na strong counterbalance and effective         \noversight of our business and affairs through \nour Lead Independent Director and our         \nIndependent Directors; fully independent Board\ncommittees with independent chairs who oversee\nthe Company\u2019s operations, risks, performance, \nand business strategy; experienced and        \ncommitted directors; and regular executive    \nsessions. Lead Independent Director Our Board \nbelieves that an active and empowered Lead    \nIndependent Director is key to providing      \nstrong, independent leadership for the Board. \nThe Lead Independent Director position,       \nelected annually by the other Independent     \nDirectors upon the recommendation of the      \nGovernance and Nominating Committee, is a     \ncritical aspect of our corporate governance   \nframework. The Board believes that Ms.        \nHackett\u2019s experience enables her to provide   \nvaluable and independent views to the         \nboardroom and ensure active communication     \nbetween management and our Independent        \nDirectors to support their oversight          \nresponsibilities, including with respect to   \nmanagement of risks and opportunities         \npresented by the markets in which Capital One \ncompetes.                                     \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  22    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II -

Director Independence Except for \nour CEO, who is the Company\u2019s founder, the    \nBoard has affirmatively determined that all   \nnominees for election to our Board are        \nindependent under Capital One\u2019s Director      \nIndependence Standards (\u201cIndependence         \nStandards\u201d), which have been adopted by the   \nBoard as part of Capital One\u2019s Corporate      \nGovernance Guidelines. The Independence       \nStandards reflect the director independence   \nrequirements set forth in the New York Stock  \nExchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules and other applicable  \nlegal and regulatory rules, and also describe \ncertain categorical relationships that the    \nBoard has determined to be immaterial for     \npurposes of determining director independence.\nThe categorical relationships that the Board  \nhas deemed immaterial for purposes of         \ndetermining director independence are: (i)    \nrelationships between Capital One and an      \nentity where the director serves solely as a  \nnon-managementdirector; (ii) transactions     \nbetween Capital One and a director or a       \ndirector\u2019s immediate family member (or their  \nprimary business affiliations) that fall below\nthe numerical thresholds in the NYSE rules (or\ndo not otherwise preclude independence under  \nthose standards), and that are ordinary       \ncourse, on arm\u2019s-lengthmarket terms, and, in  \nthe case of extensions of credit, followed    \nusual underwriting procedures, present no more\nthan the normal collectability risk, or other \nunfavorable features and are in compliance    \nwith applicable legal and regulatory          \nrequirements; and (iii) discretionary         \ncontributions made by Capital One to not-for- \nprofitorganizations, foundations, or          \nuniversities in which a director (or immediate\nfamily member) serves as an executive officer \nthat in any single fiscal year within the last\nthree years do not exceed the greater of $1   \nmillion or 2% of that entity\u2019s consolidated   \ngross revenues.

Our   \ndirectors are also encouraged to pursue other \neducational opportunities, at the Company\u2019s   \nexpense, to enhance directors\u2019 ability to     \nperform their duties. Executive Sessions Our  \nIndependent Directors regularly convene       \nexecutive sessions led by the Lead Independent\nDirector at Board and committee meetings, as  \nneeded. The executive sessions allow the      \nIndependent Directors to discuss strategy, CEO\nand senior management performance and         \ncompensation, succession planning, Board      \neffectiveness, and other matters without      \nmanagement present.

To ensure the process stays  \ncurrent and continues to generate rich        \ninsights, the Board follows a cyclical,       \nprogrammatic approach when conducting Board   \nand committee evaluations. This approach      \nincludes regular, holistic reviews of the     \nevaluation framework, methodology, and form.  \nWhile the Board and each of its committees    \nconducts a formal evaluation annually, the    \nBoard considers its performance and that of   \nits committees continuously throughout the    \nyear and shares feedback with management. In  \naddition, each year, the Board and its        \ncommittees consider a variety of evaluation   \napproaches, including written surveys,        \nindividual director interviews, group         \ndiscussions in executive session, and/or      \nengagement of a third-party facilitator. Seek \nInput Each year, the Lead Independent Director\nand committee chairs, with input and support  \nfrom management and the Governance and        \nNominating Committee, develop a process to    \nseek feedback on the Board from directors and \nselect members of management. Follow-Up A     \nsummary of the overall evaluation results is  \nshared with management to address any requests\nor enhancements in practices that may be      \nwarranted. Committee chairs report on their   \nrespective evaluations to the full Board and  \nshare key actions with management for follow- \nup. Discuss The Lead Independent Director and \ncommittee chairs, with the assistance of      \nmanagement, leverage feedback to develop key  \nthemes that emerge from the feedback and lead \na robust discussion in their respective       \nexecutive sessions. As part of the Board\u2019s    \nself-evaluation process, directors consider   \nvarious topics related to Board composition,  \neffectiveness, structure, and performance and \nthe overall mix of director skills,           \nexperience, and background.

Annual Assessment of the Lead   \nIndependent Director To support the           \nIndependent Directors in selecting the Lead   \nIndependent Director, the Governance and      \nNominating Committee oversees an annual       \nprocess to evaluate the performance and       \neffectiveness of the Lead Independent         \nDirector.

Annual       \nPerformance Assessment of the CEO Led by the  \nLead Independent Director, the Independent    \nDirectors annually assess the performance of  \nMr. Fairbank as Capital One\u2019s CEO through a   \nprocess developed and overseen by the         \nGovernance and Nominating Committee. This     \nprocess includes an in-depthdiscussion of the \nCEO\u2019s performance by the Independent Directors\nin executive session at a joint meeting of the\nCompensation Committee and the Board during   \nwhich directors consider a variety of factors.\nThe areas assessed relate to overall CEO      \nperformance, leadership, financial and        \noperating performance, governance and risk    \nmanagement, strategic performance, and        \ncustomer and associate satisfaction. The      \nIndependent Directors also consider feedback  \nfrom the Board and self-assessment materials  \nprovided by Mr. Fairbank regarding his and the\nCompany\u2019s performance and achievements during \nthe performance year. For additional          \ninformation, see \u201cChief Executive Officer     \nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 67. The annual\nCEO performance assessment is completed as    \npart of Capital One\u2019s year-endcompensation    \nprocess.

Management, with      \nguidance from the Board, is responsible for   \ndeveloping, communicating, and implementing a \nstrategy that is designed to allow Capital One\nto: (i) invest in long-term capabilities and  \nopportunities; (ii) secure competitive,       \nendgame positions in our key businesses; (iii)\nattract and retain customers; (iv) grow       \nresiliently; (v) promote ethical behavior and \ncompliance with applicable laws and           \nregulations; (vi) withstand economic stress   \nand market volatility; and (vii) adhere to the\nBoard\u2019s established risk appetite programs.   \nThese strategies allow Capital One to deliver \nlong-term value to our stockholders while     \nhelping customers succeed, associates grow,   \nand communities thrive. The development,      \nvetting, and communication of Capital One\u2019s   \nstrategy is an ongoing, iterative process that\ninvolves the Board, the CEO, the Presidents of\nour lines of business, the CFO, the General   \nCounsel and Corporate Secretary, the Chief    \nEnterprise Risk Officer, all other Executive  \nCommittee members, the Chief Audit Officer,   \nthe Corporate Strategy team, and other leaders\nacross the enterprise. Each year, the Board   \nparticipates in a set of dedicated meetings   \nfocused on long-term strategy where the CEO   \nand key senior leaders present the Company\u2019s  \ntop strategic priorities and initiatives to   \nthe Board. The Board provides input, feedback \nand effective challenge that guide the        \nCompany\u2019s strategic priorities and            \ninvestments. Following these sessions, the    \nBoard reviews assessments of the Company\u2019s    \nstrategic initiatives, performed by the       \nindependent risk management and internal audit\nfunctions, as well as approves the Company\u2019s  \nformal Strategic Plan. Furthermore, the       \nindependent risk management function regularly\nprovides the Risk Committee with, among other \nthings, reporting on the Company\u2019s performance\nagainst its risk appetite metrics, assessments\nof the external environment, and positioning  \nin the context of key risk categories. The    \nBoard regularly reviews the financial,        \ncompetitive, and risk performance of the      \nCompany and receives updates on key strategic \ninitiatives. Each line of business also       \nreports to the Board the progress on their    \nstrategic and financial initiatives on an     \nannual basis. Capital One assesses performance\nagainst strategic initiatives by reviewing the\nCompany\u2019s financial performance, competitive  \npositioning and market share, technology      \ncapabilities, performance against risk        \nappetites and limits, customer satisfaction   \nand advocacy scores, talent management, system\navailability and downtime statistics, risk    \nratings and measurements, market-based        \nindicators, and other quantitative and        \nqualitative performance assessments. Utilizing\na diversity of measurement tools, the Board   \nremains informed and can carefully monitor and\nassess the progress and effectiveness of our  \nstrategic positioning and performance. The    \nBoard also regularly engages management in    \ndiscussions regarding financial performance   \nand trajectory, stockholder feedback, capital \nallocation, strategy implementation, risk     \nmitigation plans, and other matters affecting \nthe Company\u2019s long-term strategy, as          \nappropriate.                                  \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            31  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nFinancial Performance and Associated Risks The\nBoard oversees the Company\u2019s financial        \nperformance by reviewing with management, on a\nregular basis, the Company\u2019s quarterly and    \nannual financial statements. The Audit        \nCommittee oversees the integrity of the       \nCompany\u2019s financial statements by, among other\nthings, obtaining independent assurance as to \nthe completeness and accuracy of the Company\u2019s\nfinancial statements from an independent      \nregistered public accounting firm, whose      \nqualifications, independence, and performance \nit reviews on an annual basis. The Audit      \nCommittee also oversees the integrity of the  \nCompany\u2019s internal controls over financial    \nreporting by, among other things, reviewing   \nperiodic assessments of the adequacy and      \neffectiveness of the Company\u2019s financial      \ncontrols performed by both the Company\u2019s      \nindependent registered public accounting firm \nand the Company\u2019s internal audit function. In \naddition, the Board, either directly or       \nthrough the Risk Committee, plays an integral \nrole in the oversight of capital management,  \nfunding of the balance sheet, liquidity and   \nmarket risk management, management of the     \nCompany\u2019s investment portfolio, and the       \nmanagement of other asset and liability risk  \nmatters. Enterprise-Wide Risk Management      \nFramework Effective risk management and       \ncontrol processes are critical to our safety  \nand soundness, our ability to comply with     \nlaws, rules and regulations, our ability to   \npredict and manage the challenges that Capital\nOne and the financial services industry face  \nand, ultimately, our long-term corporate      \nsuccess. The enterprise-wide risk management  \nframework defines the Board\u2019s appetite for    \nrisk taking and enables senior management to  \nunderstand, manage and report on risk. The    \nrisk management framework is implemented      \nenterprise-wide and includes seven major risk \ncategories: compliance, credit, liquidity,    \nmarket, operational, reputation, and          \nstrategic. The Board\u2019s role in risk oversight \nof Capital One is consistent with its         \nleadership structure, with the CEO and other  \nmembers of senior management having           \nresponsibility for assessing and managing     \nCapital One\u2019s risk exposure on a day-to-      \ndaybasis, and the Board and its committees    \nproviding oversight in connection with these  \nefforts. The full Board, with the support of  \nits committees, oversees the entire           \nenterprise-wide risk management framework for \nthe Company. The Board\u2019s oversight focuses on \nour material risks and any notable emerging   \nrisks to ensure that Capital One\u2019s risk       \nmanagement is adequate. The Chair of the Risk \nCommittee, in collaboration with the Lead     \nIndependent Director, helps ensure that the   \nBoard has appropriate discussions on risk     \ntopics. The Risk Committee is responsible for \nsetting and recommending to the Board for     \napproval risk appetites taking into account   \nthe Company\u2019s structure, risk profile,        \ncomplexity, activities, size, and other       \nappropriate risk-related factors. The Risk    \nCommittee considers both current risk,        \nincluding timeframes reflected by those risks,\nas well as emerging risks and future threats. \nAt the management level, senior management    \ncommittees serve as governance forums for the \nCEO, Chief Risk Officers, and other members of\nsenior management to receive and discuss risk \nmanagement information, reports, views, and   \nescalated matters from the lines of business, \nthe independent risk management function, the \ninternal audit function, and other areas of   \nthe Company. Enterprise-wide risk management  \nis generally the responsibility of the Chief  \nRisk Officers. The Chief Enterprise Risk      \nOfficer has accountability for proposing risk \nappetites, limits, and reporting levels       \nrelated to compliance, operational,           \nreputation, and strategic risk, and the Chief \nCredit and Financial Risk Officer has         \naccountability for proposing risk appetites,  \nlimits, and reporting levels related to       \ncredit, liquidity, and market risk. The Chief \nEnterprise Risk Officer is also responsible   \nfor ensuring that the Company has an overall  \nenterprise risk framework and that it         \nroutinely assesses and reports on enterprise  \nlevel risks. The Chief Risk Officers report   \nboth to the CEO and to the Risk Committee, and\nupdate the Risk Committee regularly on a      \nvariety of risk matters, including the        \nCompany\u2019s performance against risk metrics, in\naddition to ad hoc reports on emerging risks. \nIn addition, the Risk Committee and the Board \nparticipate in periodic education sessions on \nemerging trends and risk matters, such as     \nevolving cybersecurity threats and generative \nartificial intelligence. The Board and its    \ncommittees meet with outside advisors         \nperiodically, as appropriate and necessary,   \nand are empowered to consult at any time with \noutside advisors to support their oversight   \nresponsibilities. The Audit Committee also    \nplays an important risk oversight function,   \nincluding oversight of financial risks as     \nfurther discussed above in \u201cFinancial         \nPerformance and Associated Risks.\u201d The        \nCompensation Committee oversees               \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  32    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \ncompensation policies and practices to ensure \nbalanced risk-taking in our compensation      \nprograms, practices, and decisions as further \ndescribed in \u201cCompensation Policies and       \nPractices\u201d below. Cybersecurity and Technology\nRisk As a financial services company entrusted\nwith the safeguarding of sensitive            \ninformation, including sensitive personal     \ninformation, we believe that a strong         \nenterprise cybersecurity program is a vital   \ncomponent of effectively managing risks       \nrelated to the confidentiality, integrity,    \navailability, and security of our data. The   \nRisk Committee of the Board is responsible for\noverseeing our enterprise risk management     \nframework, including cybersecurity and        \ntechnology risk. At least quarterly, the Risk \nCommittee receives reports from management on \nour cybersecurity and technology risk, key    \nenterprise cybersecurity initiatives, and on  \nany identified significant threats or         \nincidents, or new risk developments. The Risk \nCommittee coordinates with the full Board     \nregarding the strategic implications of cyber \nand technology risks. At least annually, the  \nBoard, either directly or through the Risk    \nCommittee, reviews the Company\u2019s technology   \nstrategy with the Chief Information Officer;  \nreviews the Company\u2019s information security    \nprogram with the Chief Information Security   \nOfficer and Chief Technology Risk Officer; and\napproves the Company\u2019s information security   \nprogram. Succession Planning Pursuant to our  \nCorporate Governance Guidelines, the Board is \nresponsible for maintaining a succession plan \nfor the CEO and certain senior executive      \npositions. A planning process has been        \ndeveloped and maintained to identify, develop,\nand assess successors to the CEO and such     \npositions. The Board reviews and updates these\nsuccession plans at least annually, including \nthe most recent review and update in late     \n2024. Our Board believes that the directors   \nand the CEO should work together on executive \nsuccession planning and that the entire Board \nshould be involved. Each year, as part of the \nsuccession planning process, our CEO provides \nthe Board with recommendations on, and        \nevaluations of, potential CEO successors. The \nBoard considers a number of factors such as   \nexperience, skills, competencies, and         \npotential in its review of the senior         \nexecutive team to assess which executives     \npossess or can develop the attributes that the\nBoard believes are necessary to lead and      \nachieve the Company\u2019s goals. Among other steps\ntaken to promote this process throughout the  \nyear, executives one and two levels below the \nCEO often attend Board meetings and present to\nthe Board, providing the Board with numerous  \nopportunities to interact with our senior     \nmanagement and assess their leadership        \ncapabilities. Additionally, each line of      \nbusiness, independent risk management,        \ninternal audit, and finance functions engage  \nin succession planning for key roles at least \nonce per year. The Chief Human Resources      \nOfficer reviews these line of business and    \nfunctional area succession plans. In addition \nto the general succession plan, our Board     \nproactively reviewed plans for temporary      \nsuccessors across key roles in 2024. The      \ntemporary succession plan is intended to      \nidentify the leaders who can assume the       \nresponsibilities in the immediate short-term  \nto ensure business continuity, day-to-        \ndaymanagement of the team and business for our\nsenior management, and other key roles. Our   \nBoard also has established steps to address   \nemergency CEO succession planning for an      \nunplanned CEO succession event. Our emergency \nCEO succession planning is intended to enable \nour Company to respond to an unexpected CEO   \ntransition by continuing our Company\u2019s safe   \nand sound operation and minimizing potential  \ndisruption or loss of continuity to our       \nCompany\u2019s operations and strategy. The Board  \nreviews annually the CEO\u2019s emergency successor\nrecommendations. As a result of this evergreen\nprocess, there is a named CEO emergency       \nsuccessor should the CEO become unexpectedly  \nunable to serve. Compensation Policies and    \nPractices The Compensation Committee oversees \nall of our compensation policies and          \npractices, including our incentive            \ncompensation policies and practices, with a   \nview toward ensuring that such policies and   \npractices encourage balanced risk-taking, are \ncompatible with effective controls and risk   \nmanagement, align with our business           \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            33  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                              \n  Section II - Corporate Governance at        \n  Capital One                                 \n                                              \nstrategy, and enable the Company to attract   \nand retain top talent, especially in key job  \nfunctions.

The         \nIncentive Compensation Governance Policy      \nprovides the framework for oversight of the   \ndesign of incentive compensation programs. In \nsetting executive compensation, the           \nCompensation Committee assesses each of the   \nNEOs against one or more performance          \nobjectives specifically designed to evaluate  \nthe degree to which the NEOs balanced risks   \ninherent in their specific roles. The         \nCompensation Committee also implements        \nadditional risk-balancing features for certain\nequity awards, as described in more detail in \nthe \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d    \nbeginning on page 55. In addition, the        \nCompensation Committee reviews the Company\u2019s  \nNEO and other senior executive compensation   \nprograms, as well as any other material       \nincentive compensation programs, plans, or    \nagreements. During these reviews, the         \nCompensation Committee discusses the Company\u2019s\nmost significant risks, including the         \nCompany\u2019s status with respect to managing     \nthose risks and the relationship of those     \nrisks to compensation programs. The review    \nincludes discussion and analysis of risk-     \nbalancing features embedded in these incentive\ncompensation programs and other actions taken \nby the Company to appropriately balance risk  \nand achieve conformance with regulatory       \nguidance. The Compensation Committee also     \ndiscusses these programs with the Company\u2019s   \nChief Enterprise Risk Officer, Chief Human    \nResources Officer, and the Compensation       \nCommittee\u2019s independent compensation          \nconsultant, as appropriate. Based on these    \ndiscussions, the Compensation Committee       \nbelieves our compensation programs are        \nconsistent with safety and soundness, operate \nin a manner that appropriately balances risk, \nand are not reasonably likely to have a       \nmaterial adverse effect on the Company. The   \nCompensation Committee also administers the   \nCompany\u2019s Clawback Policy. The Compensation   \nCommittee\u2019s active oversight, together with   \nthe Company\u2019s interactions and discussions    \nwith its regulators, has further enhanced the \nCompany\u2019s risk management and control         \nprocesses with respect to incentive           \ncompensation at the Company and supported our \ncontinued compliance with the interagency     \nguidance on sound incentive compensation      \npractices.

This review  \ntakes into account, among other factors,      \ncommittee needs, director experience,         \ncommittee succession planning, and the desire \nto balance membership continuity with new     \nperspectives. The Chair of the Governance and \nNominating Committee facilitates discussions  \nwith management, committee chairs, the        \nChairman of the Board, and individual         \ndirectors, as needed, and shares that feedback\nwith the Governance and Nominating Committee. \nThe Governance and Nominating Committee makes \nrecommendations for committee membership and  \nchairs to the full Board for review and       \napproval at least annually.

In reviewing    \nRelated Person Transactions, the Governance   \nand Nominating Committee considers all        \nrelevant facts and circumstances, which may   \ninclude: the benefits to the Company from the \ntransaction; the nature and extent of the     \nRelated Person\u2019s interest in the transaction; \nthe impact, if any, on a director\u2019s           \nindependence; any implications under Capital  \nOne\u2019s Code of Conduct (including whether the  \ntransaction would create a conflict of        \ninterest or the appearance thereof); any      \nconcerns with respect to reputational risk;   \nthe availability of other sources for         \ncomparable products or services; and the terms\nof the transaction as compared to the terms   \navailable to unrelated third parties or to    \nCapital One\u2019s associates, generally.

Climate\nand other corporate impact issues are also    \noverseen by various Capital One senior        \nmanagement committees, as appropriate. Capital\nOne looks at how risks, including climate-    \nrelated risks, could impact our Company across\nseven risk categories each quarter. The seven \nrisk categories we use to evaluate climate    \nrisks are consistent with those we use to     \nevaluate and manage all of our enterprise     \nrisks: credit, operational, strategic,        \nreputational, market, liquidity, and          \ncompliance risks. We also identify emerging   \nrisks that may occur across a longer time     \nhorizon, happen in the future, or have a      \npotential impact that is difficult to predict.\nFurther information about our climate strategy\ncan be found on our website in our 2023 ESG   \nReport.

FW Cook        \nprovides competitive compensation data and    \ndirector compensation program recommendations \nto the Compensation Committee. The competitive\ncompensation data includes information        \nregarding the compensation (cash, equity, and \nother benefits) of the non-managementdirectors\nwithin Capital One\u2019s peer comparator group.   \nThe Compensation Committee considers this     \ninformation and FW Cook\u2019s recommendations, and\nfinalizes a proposed director compensation    \nstructure for review and approval by the full \nBoard, typically in the second quarter of each\nyear.

Based on its review of      \ncompetitive market data and guidance from FW  \nCook in the second quarter of 2024, the       \nCompensation Committee determined that the    \nCompany\u2019s director compensation program meets \nthe objectives listed above.

The increase to the annual RSU grant was\nin recognition of the demands of service for  \nBoard members and to further align            \ncompensation for such service with the        \nCompany\u2019s peer comparator group. Each non-    \nmanagementdirector serving on May 2, 2024,    \nreceived on such date an award of 1,658 RSUs  \nunder the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan with a    \ngrant date fair value of $235,121, or $141.81 \nper share. The RSUs were valued based on the  \nfair market value of a share of Capital One   \ncommon stock on the date of grant and vest one\nyear from the date of grant, with the delivery\nof the underlying shares deferred until the   \ndirector\u2019s service with the Board ends. Other \nBenefits Under the Capital One Financial      \nCorporation Non-EmployeeDirectors Deferred    \nCompensation Plan (\u201cNEDDCP\u201d), non-            \nmanagementdirectors who reside in the United  \nStates may voluntarily defer all or a portion \nof their cash compensation and receive        \ndeferred income benefits. Participants in the \nplan can direct their individual cash         \ndeferrals among ten investments available     \nthrough the plan. Beginning in 2023, under the\nNEDDCP, non-managementdirectors who have met  \ntheir stock ownership requirement may also    \nelect to defer their entire annual RSU award  \nissued for their service as a director. Non-  \nmanagementdirectors participating in the      \nNEDDCP receive their deferred cash income     \nbenefits and/or deferred stock benefits when  \nthey cease serving as directors, upon certain \nother distribution events specified in the    \nplan, or at such earlier time as authorized by\nthe Compensation Committee, in cash or in     \nCapital One common stock, respectively. Upon a\nchange of control, Capital One will pay each  \ndirector within 30 days of the change of      \ncontrol. Those who elect to defer cash will   \nreceive a lump sum cash payment equal to the  \ndirector\u2019s cash account balance as of the date\nof the change of control. Those who elect to  \ndefer RSUs will receive shares of Capital One \ncommon stock or cash for each RSU in an amount\nequal to the per-shareamount paid to Capital  \nOne\u2019s stockholders in connection with the     \nchange of control. Capital One also offers    \nnon-managementdirectors the opportunity to    \ndirect a contribution of up to $10,000        \nannually from Capital One to a charitable     \norganization of their choice. All of the non- \nmanagementdirectors who served during 2024,   \nother than Mr. Warner, elected to make such a \ncharitable contribution in 2024. In addition, \nall directors who served during 2024 were     \neligible, and seven directors elected to      \nparticipate, in a Capital One broad-based     \ncharitable contribution program, which is also\navailable to Capital One associates, under    \nwhich Capital One made a contribution of      \n$5,000 per director to a charitable           \norganization of their choice. Directors also  \noccasionally have access to certain Capital   \nOne-sponsoredevents for which they receive    \ntickets. Directors also receive reimbursements\nfor certain board-related expenses, including \nexternal educational seminars and travel-     \nrelated costs incurred to attend Board        \nmeetings. Such reimbursements are not included\nas compensation for the directors in the table\nbelow.                                        \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            51  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                        \n  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  \n                        \n                                       \n  Section III -

While the    \nvote is non-binding,the Board values the      \nopinions that stockholders express through    \ntheir votes and in any additional dialogue.   \nThe Board will consider the outcome of the    \nvote when making future compensation          \ndecisions. As discussed in the \u201cCompensation  \nDiscussion and Analysis\u201d section beginning on \npage 55, our Board has provided compensation  \nprograms for the CEO and the other NEOs that  \nare competitive with the market, performance- \nbased, and transparent and that align with our\nstockholders\u2019 interests over multiple time    \nhorizons. Our CEO\u2019s and other NEOs\u2019           \ncompensation programs have consisted primarily\nof performance-based incentive opportunities, \nincluding multiple types of equity instruments\nwith multi-year vesting schedules. The        \nultimate value of these equity-based awards is\nsubject to Capital One\u2019s sustained performance\nover time, both on an absolute basis and      \nrelative to our peers. For the 2024           \nperformance year, approximately 84% of the    \nCEO\u2019s total compensation is equity-based and  \nat-riskto the Company\u2019s performance and 100%  \nof his compensation is deferred for a three-  \nyear period. As discussed under \u201cNEO          \nCompensation\u201d beginning on page 81, under the \n2024 NEO compensation program applicable to   \nour other NEOs, approximately 50% of total    \ncompensation is provided through equity-based \nvehicles, which were all at-riskbased on the  \nCompany\u2019s performance and subject to vesting  \nover multiple time horizons.

The Committee seeks to \ndirectly link the compensation of the NEOs    \nwith the Company\u2019s performance and the        \nexecutives\u2019 contributions to that performance.\nIn 2024, Capital One delivered strong         \nfinancial results and made significant        \nprogress on our long-term strategic           \ninitiatives, enabled by years of              \ntransformation and growth as well as key      \ninvestments in talent, technology, and risk   \nmanagement. The Company also announced the    \nDiscover Transaction in February 2024. The    \nproposed transaction is subject to regulatory \napproval and closing conditions and we        \nanticipate the Discover Transaction will close\nin early 2025. Financial and business line    \nfinancial results in 2024 were strong. The    \ncombination of strong top-linegrowth and      \ndisciplined expense management drove solid    \nprofitability and capital generation. Consumer\ncredit losses continued to be impacted by     \ndelayed charge-offs from the pandemic.        \nHowever, Capital One\u2019s ability to monitor and \nanalyze portfolio and competitive trends      \ncoming out of the pandemic, as well as        \nmanagement\u2019s actions in response to these     \ninsights, has enabled the Company to          \nsuccessfully navigate the post-pandemic credit\nenvironment and drive favorable momentum on   \nconsumer credit results versus industry peers.\nOur Domestic Card business delivered strong   \nand resilient returns and record account      \noriginations.

The      \nperformance shares provide an opportunity for \nthe executive to receive from 0% to 150% of a \ntarget number of shares of the Company\u2019s      \ncommon stock based on the Company\u2019s           \nperformance over a three-year period beginning\nJanuary 1, 2025.                              \n                                              \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026            \u2026    \n         \u2026          \u2026       \u2026                 \n      \u2026          \u2026                            \n      \u2026          \u2026                            \n      \u2026                                       \n            \u2026          \u2026       \u2026    \u2026         \n            \u2026          \u2026       \u2026    \u2026         \n            \u2026          \u2026       \u2026    \u2026         \n            \u2026          \u2026       \u2026    \u2026         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (1)  Amounts do not include discretionary   \n       bonuses.                               \n                                              \nConsideration of Stockholder Feedback and 2024\nSay on Pay Vote The Committee and the Board   \nvalue the input of our stockholders and strive\nto foster a constructive dialogue with        \nstockholders on matters of executive          \ncompensation and corporate governance. At our \n2024 Annual Stockholder Meeting, 95% of our   \nstockholders supported our executive          \ncompensation program by approving our non-    \nbindingadvisory vote on executive compensation\n(\u201c2024 Say on Pay Vote\u201d). Though the Committee\nrecognized the 2024 Say on Pay Vote reflected \nstrong support for the Company\u2019s executive    \ncompensation programs, the Committee remains  \ncommitted to stockholder engagement. In 2024, \nwe continued to strengthen our outreach to    \nstockholders to maintain strong lines of      \ncommunication with our stockholders and shared\nstockholders\u2019 perspectives with the Committee \nand the Board. Management and our Investor    \nRelations team engaged in direct outreach and \ndiscussions with stockholders in a variety of \nforums. In 2024, our teams attended 17        \ninvestor conferences and hosted over 300      \ninvestor engagements. See \u201cStockholder        \nEngagement Program\u201d beginning on page 34 for  \nmore information. From this outreach, the     \nCommittee and the Board gained valuable       \ninsight into our investors\u2019 views about the   \nCompany, including our executive compensation \nprograms. The Committee and the Independent   \nDirectors considered these views and feedback \nin approving year-endincentive awards for 2024\nand structuring and approving the 2025        \ncompensation programs for the NEOs. In recent \nyears, as a result of the feedback received   \nfrom investors, the Committee made the        \nfollowing enhancements to our executive       \ncompensation programs and disclosure:         \n                                              \n       Disclosure of Performance Share        \n       Awards Realized Compensation.          \n       Stockholders have expressed a desire   \n       for clearer information regarding the  \n       realized pay associated with the       \n       performance share awards granted to    \n       the NEOs. We added disclosure          \n  \u220e    regarding the settlement value         \n       resulting from the performance share   \n       awards that vested during the          \n       performance year based on the          \n       Company\u2019s performance for the          \n       associated three-year performance      \n       period.

Capital One\u2019s \nexecutive compensation program has four       \nprimary objectives. Strongly link pay and     \nperformance by providing compensation based on\nboth business and individual performance while\nappropriately balancing risk Capital One      \nemphasizes pay-for-performanceat all          \norganizational levels. Typically, as an       \nexecutive\u2019s level of responsibility increases,\nso does the proportion of the executive\u2019s pay \nthat is subject to performance criteria.      \nTherefore, the NEOs have the highest          \nproportion of their pay directly linked to    \nCompany and individual performance, as        \ncompared to other associates. Awards made to  \nthe NEOs in February 2025 for the 2024        \nperformance year were based on Company and    \nindividual performance, and on demonstrating  \nspecific leadership competencies assessed     \nthrough a comprehensive performance management\nprocess that included an individual assessment\nspecifically designed to evaluate the degree  \nto which the executive balanced risks inherent\nto their role. The Chief Enterprise Risk      \nOfficer compiled these risk assessments and   \nthe Chief Human Resources Officer reviewed the\nassessments for the NEOs. Separately, the     \nChief Audit Officer compiled and reviewed the \nrisk assessment for the Chief Enterprise Risk \nOfficer and the Chief Credit and Financial    \nRisk Officer. The Committee considered the    \nassessments in making its determinations      \nregarding individual performance and          \ncompensation levels. Align our executives\u2019    \ninterests with those of our stockholders The  \nCommittee and the Independent Directors are   \ncommitted to designing incentive compensation \nprograms that reward individual and Company   \nperformance and that are aligned with the     \ncreation of stockholder value over the long   \nterm. A portion of the CEO\u2019s performance share\naward is directly linked to the Company\u2019s     \nrelative TSR over a three-year period. TSR    \nalso continues to be explicitly included in   \nthe financial and operating performance       \nfactors considered by the Committee and the   \nIndependent Directors to determine NEO year-  \nendincentive awards. In addition, because     \nabout half of NEO compensation is delivered   \nthrough deferred, equity-based vehicles that  \nvest over multiple time horizons, the NEOs    \nhave a significant stake in the success of the\nCompany. The Committee and the Independent    \nDirectors also have the flexibility to adjust \ncompensation decisions from year to year to   \ntake into account the Company\u2019s performance   \nand evolving market practices. In addition, we\nhave established specific stock ownership     \npolicies that the NEOs must meet and stock    \nretention provisions applicable to certain    \nequity awards. Reward performance over        \nmultiple time horizons Our compensation       \nprograms are structured to encourage our      \nexecutives to deliver strong results over the \nshort- term while making decisions that create\nsustained value for our stockholders over the \nlong-term. For 2024, approximately 84% of the \nCEO\u2019s total compensation was equity-based and \nat-riskto the performance of the Company\u2019s    \nstock price, and 100% of his year-endincentive\ncompensation was deferred for a three-year    \nperiod. In addition, approximately 50% of     \ntotal compensation for NEOs other than the CEO\nwas provided through equity-based vehicles    \nwhich were at-riskto the performance of the   \nCompany\u2019s stock price and subject to vesting  \nover multiple time horizons. The use of       \ndeferred, equity-based compensation vehicles  \nwith multi-year vesting terms advances our    \ngoal of aligning the ultimate value realized  \nby the NEOs with the performance of the       \nCompany\u2019s stock over time because the value of\nthese compensation vehicles increases and     \ndecreases based on the performance of the     \nCompany\u2019s stock price in both current and     \nfuture periods. Attract, retain, and motivate \ntop executive talent To attract, retain, and  \nmotivate exceptional leaders, we believe that \ncompensation opportunities at Capital One must\nbe competitive with the marketplace for       \ntalent. The Committee and the Independent     \nDirectors strive to preserve a competitive pay\nmix and total target compensation values in   \nthe executive compensation program, as well as\nprovide competitive total rewards based on our\nselected peer group. See \u201cPeer Groups\u201d        \nbeginning on page 90 for information regarding\nhow the Committee and the Independent         \nDirectors utilized the Company\u2019s peer group in\ndetermining executive compensation.           \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            65  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nUse of Judgment The Committee believes that   \nexercising judgment is an important element in\nreaching balanced compensation decisions that \nare consistent with our strategy, risk        \nmanagement, and reward both current-year      \nperformance and sustained long-term value     \ncreation, and supplements other aspects of    \nCapital One\u2019s pay-for-performancephilosophy.  \nBy applying informed judgment, the Committee  \nseeks to mitigate the risks associated with a \nrigid and strictly formulaic compensation     \nprogram, which could unintentionally create   \nincentives for our executives to focus only on\ncertain performance metrics, encourage        \nimprudent risk-taking, and not provide the    \nbest long-term results for stockholders. In   \naddition, the use of judgment allows the      \nCommittee to respond to changes in economic   \nconditions, our operating environment, and    \nother significant factors that may affect the \nlong-term performance of Capital One or our   \nlines of business. The use of judgment also   \nallows the Committee to adjust compensation   \nbased on factors that would not be            \nappropriately reflected by a strictly         \nformulaic approach, such as risk management,  \nchampioning Company values, and the           \ndiscrepancies between absolute and relative   \nperformance levels or recognition of          \nindividual performance levels. Our            \nCompensation Governance Cycle The Committee is\nactively engaged throughout the year, and     \nmembers of the Committee regularly meet with  \nmanagement, regarding the Company\u2019s executive \ncompensation programs and practices. In       \naddition, the Committee and the Board receive \nregular updates regarding the Company\u2019s       \nfinancial and strategic performance, including\ninformation regarding the Company\u2019s           \nperformance against the four categories of    \nquantitative and qualitative performance      \nfactors related to: financial and operating   \nperformance, governance and risk management,  \nstrategic performance, and winning with our   \ncustomers and associates (the \u201cPerformance    \nFactors\u201d) that are used by the Committee to   \ndetermine the year-endincentive awards to the \nNEOs. The Committee met six times in 2024 with\nfive of those meetings concluding with an     \nexecutive session without management present. \nAmong those six meetings, the Committee held  \ntwo joint meetings with the Board in 2024, and\nheld an additional joint meeting at the       \nbeginning of 2025 to assess Company and NEO   \nperformance and determine the year-           \nendincentive awards for the NEOs.

The Committee considers\nthe Company\u2019s and the CEO\u2019s historical        \nperformance and seeks to effectively align the\nCEO\u2019s interests with the interests of our     \nstockholders over time, support safety and    \nsoundness, and appropriately balance risk.    \n2024 CEO Compensation Program When determining\nthe structure of Mr. Fairbank\u2019s compensation  \nprogram for the 2024 performance year, the    \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nconsidered:                                   \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s performance during the   \n  \u220e    prior year and Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u2019s          \n       contribution to that performance;      \n                                              \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s performance in the       \n  \u220e    prior year relative to the             \n       performance of peer comparator         \n       companies in that year;                \n                                              \n                                              \n       the structure and amount of            \n  \u220e    compensation awarded to the CEOs of    \n       the Company\u2019s peers;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       the structure and amount of Mr.\u00a0       \n  \u220e    Fairbank\u2019s compensation awards in      \n       prior years;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       the Company\u2019s risk profile and the     \n  \u220e    time horizon over which the deferred   \n       equity-based awards will vest;         \n                                              \n                                              \n       the ultimate value of Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u2019s   \n       deferred equity-based awards (which    \n       will depend on the Company\u2019s and Mr.\u00a0  \n  \u220e    Fairbank\u2019s performance over time as    \n       well as the value of Capital One       \n       common stock at the time the awards    \n       vest); and                             \n                                              \n                                              \n       the feedback received from             \n       stockholders regarding the Company\u2019s   \n  \u220e    executive compensation programs and    \n       the compensation awarded to Mr.        \n       Fairbank.                              \n                                              \nAfter considering these factors, in February  \n2024, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors determined that Mr. Fairbank\u2019s 2024 \ncompensation program would continue to consist\nof two components: (i) an equity or equity-   \nbased award granted at the beginning of the   \nperformance year; and (ii) an opportunity for \na year-endincentive award, with the amount    \ngranted based on CEO and Company performance  \nin 2024 (granted in February 2025). Any year- \nendincentive award granted to the CEO (i)     \nwould continue to consist primarily of a      \nperformance share award, under which he may   \nreceive 0% to 150% of a target number of      \nshares of Capital One common stock based on   \nthe Company\u2019s performance over a three-year   \nperiod; and (ii) may also consist of deferred \ncash, an equity-based award, or both. In this \nmanner, the CEO\u2019s compensation will continue  \nto be completely at-riskbased on the Company\u2019s\nand Mr. Fairbank\u2019s performance, and all CEO   \ncompensation continues to be subject to a     \nthree-year deferred vesting or payout. As in  \nprior years, Mr. Fairbank did not receive any \ncash salary in 2024. The Committee and the    \nIndependent Directors determined not to       \nestablish a total target compensation amount  \nfor Mr. Fairbank\u2019s 2024 compensation program  \nto further align Mr. Fairbank\u2019s compensation  \nprogram with that of the Company\u2019s peers and  \nincrease the Committee and the Independent    \nDirectors\u2019 ability to directly link the CEO\u2019s \ncompensation to the Company\u2019s performance as  \nwell as the CEO\u2019s contributions to that       \nperformance over the short-, medium-, and     \nlong-term.                                    \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            67  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \n2024 CEO Compensation Components For          \nperformance year 2024, the year-endincentive  \nwas delivered in the form of performance      \nshares, deferred cash, and cash-settled RSUs, \nrepresenting 61%, 16%, and 15%, respectively, \nof the CEO\u2019s total performance year           \ncompensation.

The RSU award has a three-year   \ncliff-vesting schedule and vests in full at   \nthe end of a three-year performance period    \nbeginning on January 1, 2024, settles in cash \nbased on the Company\u2019s average stock price    \nover the 15 trading days preceding the vesting\ndate, and is subject to performance-based     \nvesting provisions and to clawback provisions,\neach as described in more detail under        \n\u201cAdditional Performance Conditions and        \nRecovery Provisions\u201d beginning on page 87.    \nYear-EndIncentive Opportunity A portion of Mr.\nFairbank\u2019s 2024 compensation consisted of an  \nopportunity for a year-endincentive based on  \nthe Committee\u2019s evaluation of the Company\u2019s   \nperformance during 2024 and Mr. Fairbank\u2019s    \ncontributions to that                         \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  68    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nperformance. For purposes of the year-        \nendincentive, the Committee and the           \nIndependent Directors assess the Company\u2019s    \nperformance based on the Performance Factors. \nThe Committee believes that these factors     \nappropriately reflect and balance near-term   \nperformance and long-term success for the     \nCompany\u2019s customers, associates, and          \nstockholders. The Company\u2019s 2024 performance  \nagainst the Performance Factors is described  \nin more detail under \u201c2024 Year-EndIncentive  \nDetermination\u201d beginning on page 73. The year-\nendincentive, if awarded, (i) will consist of \nan award of performance shares, and (ii) may  \nalso consist of deferred cash, an equity-based\naward, or both as determined by the Committee \nand the Independent Directors at the time the \naward is granted. The performance share awards\nand the equity-based award have a three-year  \ncliff-vesting schedule and vest in full at the\nend of a three-year performance period        \nbeginning on January 1, 2025, and the deferred\ncash bonus likewise is subject to a three-year\ndeferral period. The equity-based awards are  \nsubject to performance-based vesting          \nprovisions and all three awards are subject to\nclawback provisions each as described in more \ndetail under \u201cAdditional Performance          \nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning \non page 87. Performance Share Awards The      \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve the performance shares strengthen the \nalignment between the compensation of our NEOs\nand the Company\u2019s performance by linking the  \nultimate payout to pre-establishedabsolute    \nand/or relative performance goals, with the   \nvalue of the payout ranging from 0% to 150%.  \nThe ultimate value of the performance shares  \nupon vesting is determined by the Company\u2019s   \nperformance through its stock price. The CEO  \nyear-endincentive award consists primarily of \nperformance shares. For 2024, the performance \nshare awards were granted in two forms:       \n                                              \n       Financial Performance Share Units      \n       (\u201cFinancial Performance Shares\u201d) that  \n       vest based on the Company\u2019s financial  \n       performance, on an absolute basis and  \n       relative to the Performance Share      \n       Peers, related to a combination of     \n       two metrics: Growth of Tangible Book   \n       Value per Common Share plus Common     \n       Dividends (\u201cD+TBV\u201d) and Adjusted       \n       ROTCE over a three-year period.

The TSR Performance   \nShares create a direct link between CEO       \ncompensation and the Company\u2019s stock price and\nvalue creation over time. In addition, a      \nsignificant portion of CEO pay is delivered   \nthrough equity-based awards, the ultimate     \nvalue of which will increase or decrease based\non the performance of the Company\u2019s stock     \nprice in both current and future periods.     \nPerformance Share Award Peer Group. For both  \nthe Financial Performance Shares and the TSR  \nPerformance Shares, the Company\u2019s performance \non each metric is assessed over the three-year\nperiod relative to the \u201cPerformance Share     \nPeers\u201d which consist of the KBW Bank Index,   \nexcluding non-traditionalbanks that do not    \nfocus on lending to consumers and businesses  \n(\u201cKBW Index\u201d). The Committee believes that the\nKBW Index is an appropriate index against     \nwhich to assess the Company\u2019s performance     \nbecause it reflects institutions of a         \ncomparable size, risk profile, and business   \nmix to the Company. After the end of the      \nthree-year performance period, the Committee  \nwill certify the Company\u2019s performance and    \nissue the corresponding number of shares of   \nthe Company\u2019s common stock, if any, in        \naccordance with the relative performance      \nhurdles illustrated below. Performance Share  \nAward Formula. For all performance share      \nawards, the ultimate number of performance    \nshares earned at vesting is determined by a   \nformula based on relative performance and/or  \nabsolute performance (in the form of a        \nperformance share reduction) measures, with   \nthe value of the payout ranging from 0% to    \n150% of the target performance shares. In     \naddition, the value of the performance shares \nupon vesting is determined by the Company\u2019s   \nstock price performance. All performance share\nawards are subject to the Relative Performance\nMeasure (as described below). Only the        \nFinancial Performance Shares are subject to   \nthe Absolute Performance Measure (as described\nbelow). The award agreements applicable to all\nperformance share awards permit the Committee \nto exclude the initial effects of changes in  \ntax laws, accounting principles or            \nregulations, or other laws or provisions      \naffecting the reported results if the         \nCommittee determines that such adjustments are\nappropriate in order to prevent dilution or   \nenlargement of the benefits or potential      \nbenefits intended to be made available under  \nthe 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or necessary or \nappropriate to comply with applicable laws,   \nrules, or regulations.                        \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            71  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nRelative Performance Measure - Financial      \nPerformance Shares and TSR Performance Shares \n. Each year, the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors assess the Company\u2019s performance on \nthe basis of the performance share award      \nmetrics relative to the Performance Share     \nPeers. The Company\u2019s positive Adjusted ROTCE  \nand D+TBV, or TSR, as applicable, must be at  \nleast at the 25th percentile of the           \nPerformance Share Peers for any performance   \nshares to vest; target payout will be achieved\nat the 55th percentile of the Performance     \nShare Peers; and the maximum payout can only  \nbe achieved if the Company performs at the    \n80th percentile of the Performance Share Peers\nor greater. If the Company\u2019s Adjusted ROTCE   \nand D+TBV, or TSR, as applicable, is under the\n25th percentile, none of the relevant shares  \nwill vest and no payout will be made with     \nrespect to the award. After the end of the    \nthree-year performance period, the Committee  \nwill certify the Company\u2019s performance and    \nissue the corresponding number of shares of   \nthe Company\u2019s common stock, if any, in        \naccordance with the graph below.

The Financial   \nPerformance Shares are subject to a           \nperformance share reduction feature under     \nwhich the number of shares issued at          \nsettlement will be reduced if the Company\u2019s   \nAdjusted ROTCE for one or more fiscal years   \ncompleted during the performance period is not\npositive, no matter how well the Company      \nperforms compared to the Performance Share    \nPeers. In each year that the Company does not \nachieve positive Adjusted ROTCE, the executive\nwill forfeit 50% of that year\u2019s worth of      \nperformance shares. If the Company\u2019s Adjusted \nROTCE is not positive in each of the three    \nfiscal years in the performance period, the   \nexecutive will forfeit the entire award of    \nperformance shares.

For the 2022, 2023, and 2024 performance\nyears, the Committee and the Independent      \nDirectors have awarded RSUs to Mr. Fairbank.  \nThe vesting of the RSUs is deferred for three \nyears and settlement is in cash based on the  \nCompany\u2019s average stock price over the 15     \ntrading days preceding the vesting date. The  \nRSUs are subject to performance-based vesting \nand clawback provisions, each as described in \nmore detail under \u201cAdditional Performance     \nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning \non page 87.

The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve that this structure emphasizes        \nvariable pay and incentivizes the CEO to      \ninvest for the long-term, grow resiliently,   \nmanage risk, and deliver sustained stockholder\nvalue. This approach provides the Committee   \nand the Independent Directors the best        \nopportunity to determine the amount and form  \nof compensation based on CEO and Company      \nperformance as well as stockholder feedback.  \nIt also allows for responsiveness to current  \nbusiness and industry conditions and the      \ndynamic nature of executive compensation best \npractices. 2024 RSU Award In February 2024,   \nthe Committee and the Independent Directors   \nawarded Mr. Fairbank 18,580 RSUs, which had a \ntotal grant date value of approximately $2.5  \nmillion.

performance, including       \n       certain non-GAAP measures. We believe  \n       our non-GAAP measures help investors   \n       and other users of our financial       \n  (1)  information understand the effect of   \n       adjusting items on our selected        \n       reported results. These measures may   \n       not be comparable to similarly-titled  \n       measures reported by other companies.  \n       See Appendix A for our definition and  \n       reconciliation of these non-GAAP       \n       measures to the applicable amounts     \n       measured in accordance with GAAP.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       Pre-provision earnings is a non-GAAP   \n       metric calculated based on total net   \n       revenue less non-interest expense for  \n       the period. Management believes that   \n       this financial metric is useful in     \n  (2)  assessing the ability of a lending     \n       institution to generate income in      \n       excess of its provision for credit     \n       losses. See Appendix A for our         \n       reconciliation of these non-GAAP       \n       measures to the applicable amounts     \n       measured in accordance with GAAP.      \n                                              \n                                              \n       ROTCE is a non-GAAP measure            \n       calculated based on annualized net     \n       income (loss) available to common      \n       stockholders less income (loss) from   \n       discontinued operations, net of tax,   \n       for the period, divided by average     \n       tangible common equity. We consider    \n       this metric to be a key financial      \n       performance measure that management    \n       uses in assessing capital adequacy     \n       and the level of returns generated.    \n  (3)  While this non-GAAP measure is widely  \n       used by investors, analysts and bank   \n       regulatory agencies to assess the      \n       operating performance and capital      \n       position of financial services         \n       companies, it may not be comparable    \n       to similarly-titled measures reported  \n       by other companies. See Appendix A     \n       for our reconciliation of this         \n       non-GAAP measure to the applicable     \n       amounts measured in accordance with    \n       GAAP.                                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Operating efficiency ratio is          \n       calculated based on operating expense  \n       for the period divided by total net    \n       revenue for the period and reflects    \n       as-reported results in accordance      \n  (4)  with GAAP.

the      \nIndependent Directors also assessed Mr.       \nFairbank\u2019s contributions to Capital One\u2019s 2024\nperformance. Under Mr. Fairbank\u2019s leadership, \nthe Company\u2019s 2024 achievements were the      \nresult of long-term investments in technology,\nrisk management, talent, and a pipeline of    \ngrowth opportunities. Capital One\u2019s           \nannouncement of the Discover Transaction in   \nFebruary 2024 was a seminal moment made       \npossible by strategic choices and long-term   \ninvestments that spanned many years under Mr. \nFairbank\u2019s leadership. In addition, in 2024   \nthe Company delivered strong profitability and\nEPS, resilient account and loan growth,       \nimproved operating efficiency, and strong     \nstewardship of stockholder capital, all while \ndiligently working on activities related to   \nthe proposed Discover acquisition: the due    \ndiligence and negotiations that led to the    \ndeal announcement; the submission of required \nregulatory applications and responses to      \nregulatory inquiries and feedback; the        \nexternal engagement and public announcement of\nthe Community Benefit Plan; and the           \npreparation for a well-managed integration.   \nSolid financial results and strong momentum on\nour long-term strategic initiatives resulted  \nin the Company\u2019s stock price rising 36.0%, 3.2\npercentage points above the KBW Bank Index and\nsignificantly outpacing the S&P 500 by 13     \npercentage points. The Company continued to   \nsee the benefits of its long-term technology  \ntransformation and continued to invest in     \ninfrastructure, platforms, data, and talent   \nthat is differentiating Capital One in the    \nmarket and benefitting customers. The         \nCommittee and the Independent Directors also  \nrecognized Mr. Fairbank\u2019s leadership in making\nthe choices that have helped steadily improve \nthe Company\u2019s operating efficiency, while     \nmaintaining a long-term focus on growth. Under\nMr. Fairbank\u2019s leadership, Capital One        \nmaintained a keen focus on building and       \nsustaining strong risk management practices   \nand controls, and embedding resilience into   \nits operations and financial choices. Capital \nOne recruited skilled, experienced, and       \ndiverse talent while maintaining high         \nassociate engagement and morale scores as     \nmeasured in our regular enterprise-wide       \nsurveys. The Company was recognized externally\nfor being an exceptional place to launch or   \ngrow one\u2019s career, and the Committee          \nconsidered Mr. Fairbank\u2019s leadership in       \nmodeling and reinforcing the Company\u2019s        \nculture, values and mission with associates,  \nrecruits, partners, suppliers, and investors. \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            77  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nThe Committee and the Independent Directors   \nbelieve that the Company\u2019s strategic and      \ntactical choices in recent years, led by Mr.  \nFairbank\u2013including those leading to the       \nproposed acquisition of Discover\u2013have resulted\nin strong stockholder returns as well as the  \nstrategic, competitive, and financial         \npositioning that will continue to drive       \nstockholder value over time. The Committee and\nthe Independent Directors also took into      \naccount Mr. Fairbank\u2019s unique role as the     \nfounder of Capital One as well as peer group  \nCEO compensation levels and structure, the    \ntenures of peer companies\u2019 CEOs, and the      \nvarying degrees of success those CEOs have had\nin leading their respective companies in 2024 \nand over time. The Committee and the          \nIndependent Directors recognized that Mr.     \nFairbank does not receive a cash salary, 100% \nof his compensation is deferred for at least  \nthree years, and the majority of his          \ncompensation is equity-based and determined   \nafter performance year-endbased on the        \nCompany\u2019s results and his leadership and      \ncontributions to those results. The Committee \nand the Independent Directors believe that the\nactions taken by Mr. Fairbank and the other   \nNEOs throughout 2024 drove strong financial   \nand operating results and continued momentum  \non the achievement of its long-term strategic \nobjectives. These actions and choices have    \npositioned the Company to deliver strong and  \nsustainable financial performance, maintain   \nresilience, and create enduring value to      \nstockholders. CEO Compensation by Performance \nYear Below is a table showing Mr. Fairbank\u2019s  \ncompensation awards as they are attributable  \nto the performance years indicated. Mr.       \nFairbank\u2019s actual total compensation for      \nperformance year 2024 was approximately $33.5 \nmillion. See \u201cYear-EndIncentive Opportunity\u201d  \nbeginning on page 68 for additional           \ninformation regarding the year-endincentive   \ngranted to Mr. Fairbank for performance year  \n2024.                                         \n                                              \n                                           \u2026  \n         \u2026        \u2026                           \n         \u2026        \u2026                           \n         \u2026        \u2026                           \n         \u2026               \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n         \u2026               \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n         \u2026               \u2026        \u2026        \u2026  \n                                              \nComparison to Summary Compensation Table      \nInformation The table above is presented to   \nshow how the Committee views Mr. Fairbank\u2019s   \ncompensation and to which year the            \ncompensation awards relate. This table differs\nsubstantially from the Summary Compensation   \nTable beginning on page 96 and is therefore   \nnot a substitute for the information required \nin that table. There are two principal        \ndifferences between the Summary Compensation  \nTable and the table above:                    \n                                              \n       The table above reports equity-based   \n       awards as compensation for the         \n       performance year for which they were   \n       awarded, even if the award was         \n       granted in one year based on           \n       performance for the prior year. The    \n       Summary Compensation Table reports     \n       equity-based awards in the year in     \n  \u220e    which they were granted.

Additional details on these     \nprograms can be found in the \u201cNamed Executive \nOfficer Compensation\u201d section beginning on    \npage 96. 2025 CEO Compensation Program Each   \nyear, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors perform a comprehensive review of   \nthe CEO compensation program in consideration \nof Company and CEO performance, peer          \ncomparator group performance, historical pay  \ninformation, market practices and trends, the \nmarket for talent, stockholder and other      \nstakeholder feedback, and other relevant      \npoints of information that the Committee and  \nthe Independent Directors consider appropriate\nto assess the program and CEO compensation    \nlevel and pay design. The Committee and the   \nIndependent Directors continue to believe that\nthe CEO compensation program aligns Mr.       \nFairbank\u2019s compensation with the Company\u2019s    \nperformance over the appropriate time         \nhorizons, effectively balances risk, and      \nsupports the Company\u2019s executive compensation \ngoals and principles. In February 2025, the   \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nreviewed the 2024 compensation structure      \nutilized for Mr. Fairbank and determined that,\nfor 2025, the CEO compensation program would  \nbe substantially similar and continue to      \nconsist of two components:                    \n                                              \n       An Equity or Equity-Based Award.

Any       \n       year-end incentive award granted to    \n       the CEO: (i)\u00a0will continue to consist  \n       primarily of performance share awards  \n       under which he may receive 0% to 150%  \n       of a target number of shares of        \n       Capital One common stock based on the  \n       Company\u2019s performance over a           \n       three-year period; and (ii)\u00a0may also   \n       consist of deferred cash, an           \n  \u220e    equity-based award, or both.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nIn this manner, the CEO\u2019s compensation will   \ncontinue to be completely at-riskbased on the \nCompany\u2019s and Mr. Fairbank\u2019s performance, and \nall CEO compensation continues to be subject  \nto a three-year deferred vesting or payout. As\nin prior years, Mr. Fairbank will not receive \nany cash salary in 2025. Any deferred cash or \nequity-based award will pay out or vest after \na three-year deferral period. The Committee   \nand the Independent Directors will use their  \njudgment to determine whether to make the     \nyear-endincentive award, the form of the award\nand the value of the award.

The Committee takes into  \naccount each NEO\u2019s historical performance,    \nindividual roles and responsibilities,        \ncontributions expected from each NEO in the   \nfuture as well as the recommendations of the  \nCEO, including his assessment of each NEO\u2019s   \nperformance. In February 2024, the Committee  \nand the Independent Directors approved the    \n2024 compensation program, which is designed  \nto be consistent with the Company\u2019s pay-for-  \nperformancephilosophy. Based on market        \npractices and trends, a review of peer        \ncomparator information and in response to     \nstockholder feedback, NEO total target        \ncompensation is composed of 20% base salary,  \n25% cash incentive opportunity, and 55% long- \nterm incentive opportunity, which will consist\nof performance shares and stock-settled RSUs  \nas determined by the Committee. The Committee \nbelieves that this pay mix balances           \nstockholder interests while effectively       \nrewarding and motivating key talent. For the  \n2024 performance year, the NEOs received a mix\nof approximately 50% cash and 50% equity-based\ncompensation as follows: cash salary,         \ndetermined at the beginning of the performance\nyear; and a cash incentive and long-term      \nincentive awards, determined following the end\nof the performance year based on the          \nCommittee\u2019s evaluation of Company and         \nindividual performance during the past year.  \nThe long-term incentive awards granted for the\n2024 performance year consisted of performance\nshares (approximately 27% of total awarded    \ncompensation) and stock-settled RSUs          \n(approximately 23% of total awarded           \ncompensation). All of the equity awards vest  \nover a three-year period. The terms of the    \nperformance share awards are substantially    \nsimilar to the terms of the Financial         \nPerformance Share awards granted to our CEO in\n2024, as described earlier under \u201cPerformance \nShare Awards\u201d beginning on page 69. The table \nbelow summarizes the NEO compensation program \nthat the Committee and the Independent        \nDirectors approved for the 2024 performance   \nyear.

approved 2024 cash base \nsalaries for the NEOs ranging from $1.0       \nmillion to $1.4 million. Individual details   \nfor each NEO are provided in the \u201cNEO         \nCompensation by Performance Year\u201d table found \non page 85. Year-EndIncentive Awards A portion\nof the NEOs\u2019 2024 compensation consisted of an\nopportunity for a year-endincentive award     \nbased on Company and the NEO\u2019s individual     \nperformance in 2024. This award, if granted,  \nmay consist of long-term incentive awards in  \nthe form of performance shares and/or RSUs,   \nand a cash incentive award. In February 2025, \nthe Committee and the Independent Directors   \ndetermined to award each NEO performance      \nshares, a cash incentive award, and RSUs as   \nrecognition of Company and NEO individual     \nperformance in 2024. The year-endincentive    \nawards are subject to performance-based       \nvesting and clawback provisions as discussed  \nbelow under \u201cAdditional Performance Conditions\nand Recovery Provisions\u201d beginning on page 87.\nCash Incentive Awards The cash incentive      \nawards provided to the NEOs are based on the  \nCommittee\u2019s evaluation of the Company\u2019s       \nperformance during 2024. In February 2024, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nestablished a target value for the cash       \nincentive for each NEO consisting of          \napproximately 25% of the NEOs\u2019 total target   \ncompensation. The Committee and the           \nIndependent Directors may determine to award  \n0% to 150% of the cash incentive target value \nbased on Company performance. For purposes of \nthe cash incentive awards, the Committee and  \nthe Independent Directors assess the Company\u2019s\nperformance based on the Performance Factors. \nThe Committee believes that these factors     \nappropriately reflect and balance near-term   \nperformance and long-term success for the     \nCompany\u2019s customers, associates, and          \nstockholders. See \u201cCompany Performance        \nAssessment\u201d beginning on page 74 for details  \nregarding the Performance Factors. In February\n2025, the Committee and the Independent       \nDirectors approved cash incentive awards for  \nthe NEOs ranging from approximately $1.95     \nmillion to $2.6 million, representing a payout\nat 150% of the target award values established\nby the Committee in February 2024, based on   \nactual Company performance in 2024. Individual\ndetails for each NEO are provided in the table\nbelow showing compensation by performance     \nyear. The assessment of Company performance   \nfor the NEOs is consistent with the assessment\nperformed in connection with the CEO year-    \nendincentive award. The Committee and the     \nIndependent Directors determined that these   \nawards were appropriate in light of the       \nCompany\u2019s performance as described under \u201c2024\nYear-EndIncentive Determination\u201d beginning on \npage 73 in connection with the determinations \nby the Committee and the Independent Directors\nrelating to the CEO\u2019s year-endincentive       \nawards. Long-Term Incentive Awards Long-term  \nincentive awards are designed to reward       \nindividual performance and align a significant\nportion of compensation with achievement of   \nboth annual and long-term performance goals.  \nIn determining the actual amounts to be       \nawarded to each NEO, the Committee considered \neach NEO\u2019s contribution to the Company\u2019s      \nperformance for 2024, as well as the          \nindividual performance of each NEO. The       \nCommittee also received input from the CEO on \nhis assessment of each NEO\u2019s individual       \nperformance and his recommendations for       \ncompensation of the NEOs. The CEO also        \nassessed the degree to which the NEO balanced \nrisks inherent in the NEO\u2019s role. These       \nassessments included the use of both          \nquantitative and qualitative risk measures and\nwere compiled by the Chief Enterprise Risk    \nOfficer and reviewed by the Chief Human       \nResources Officer, and separately the Chief   \nAudit Officer                                 \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            83  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \ncompiled and reviewed the assessment for the  \nChief Enterprise Risk Officer and Chief Credit\nand Financial Risk Officer, before such       \nassessments were presented to the Committee   \nand the Independent Directors for their       \nconsideration. In February 2025, the Committee\nand the Independent Directors granted long-   \nterm incentive awards, consisting of stock-   \nsettled RSUs and performance shares, to the   \nNEOs, as recognition for individual NEO       \nperformance in 2024 and to drive further long-\nterm performance. The long-term incentive     \nawards granted to these NEOs for performance  \nyear 2024 ranged from approximately $2.9      \nmillion to $3.8 million.

Additional details on these     \nprograms can be found in the \u201cNamed Executive \nOfficer Compensation\u201d section beginning on    \npage 96. In addition, from time to time the   \nCommittee and the Independent Directors may   \napprove discretionary bonuses to NEOs for     \nexceptional contributions to important        \ninitiatives or for accepting incremental      \nresponsibilities. In 2024, the Company entered\ninto a cash retention agreement with Mr.      \nCooper based on his expected critical role in \nthe potential acquisition and integration of  \nDiscover. On October 1, 2024, 50% of the      \naward, in the amount of $625,000, was earned  \nand, subject to continuous employment and     \ncertain other conditions, the remaining 50%   \nwill be earned on the later of the closing    \ndate of the Discover Transaction and December \n31, 2025. 2025 NEO Compensation Program Each  \nyear, the Committee reviews the NEO           \ncompensation program in light of Company      \nperformance data, peer comparator group       \nperformance data, historical pay information, \ndata on specific market practices and trends, \nstockholder feedback, and other relevant      \npoints of information. The program consists of\nmultiple compensation vehicles that directly  \nlink the NEOs\u2019 compensation with the Company\u2019s\nperformance over multiple time horizons, align\nthe NEOs\u2019 interests with the interests of the \nCompany\u2019s stockholders, support safety and    \nsoundness, and encourage appropriate risk-    \ntaking. In February 2025, the Committee and   \nthe Independent Directors approved the 2025   \ncompensation program for our NEOs, which is   \nsubstantially similar to the 2024 program.    \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  86    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nAdditional Performance Conditions and Recovery\nProvisions The awards granted to our NEOs     \ninclude the following provisions that are     \ndesigned to further enhance alignment between \npay and performance and balance the risks that\nour incentive compensation programs might     \notherwise encourage:                          \n                                             \n  \u220e    Performance-based vesting provisions  \n                                             \n                                    \n  \u220e    Performance share reduction  \n                                    \n                            \n  \u220e    Misconduct clawback  \n                            \n                                       \n  \u220e    Financial restatement clawback  \n                                       \nThese terms and conditions apply to certain   \nincentive awards granted to every executive   \nofficer and not just to the NEOs.

In addition, the Committee            \nnevertheless determined that these awards     \nshould be subject to additional performance   \nconditions so that the value received by the  \nexecutives is also conditioned upon the       \nCompany continuing to meet certain operating  \nperformance thresholds for each and every     \nfiscal year ending in the three-year vesting  \nperiod. Any forfeitures will be cumulative    \nover the three-year vesting period. In this   \nmanner, regardless of our executives\u2019 past    \nperformance and our stock price performance,  \nthe awards subject to performance-based       \nvesting remain at risk of complete forfeiture \nover the three-year vesting period.           \nPerformance-based vesting provisions apply to \nthe following awards:                         \n                                   \n  \u220e    All NEO stock-settled RSUs  \n                                   \n                                  \n  \u220e    All CEO cash-settled RSUs  \n                                  \nThese performance conditions do not present   \nany upside potential for the NEOs\u2019            \ncompensation but instead create an additional \nat-riskelement to the compensation that has   \nbeen awarded to them. Imposing these          \nadditional performance conditions is designed \nto further reflect our approach of balancing  \nrisk and performance over the long term. For  \nawards granted since January 2014, vesting is \nconditioned on the Company achieving positive \nCore Earnings (as defined below). If Core     \nEarnings are not positive for any fiscal year \nin the vesting period, the named executive    \nofficer will automatically forfeit 50% of one \nyear\u2019s worth of vesting (i.e., one-sixthof the\ntotal award). In addition, the Committee will \ndetermine the extent to which any named       \nexecutive officer was accountable for the     \noutcome                                       \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            87  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nand, based on such determination, the         \nCommittee will decide whether any or all of   \nthe remaining 50% of one year\u2019s worth of      \nvesting will also be forfeited. The Committee \nmay also decide to delay the vesting of the   \napplicable portion of the award not so        \nforfeited. For the NEOs, these determinations \nwill be made each year prior to the scheduled \nvesting date, based on the Core Earnings for  \nthe fiscal year ended prior to such vesting   \ndate. For the CEO, these determinations will  \nbe made prior to the scheduled vesting date at\nthe end of the three-year vesting period,     \ntaking into account Core Earnings for each    \nfiscal year within the period. Core Earnings  \nfocuses on whether profits are being generated\nby our basic business, as opposed to other    \nfactors that may not reflect business         \nfundamentals. The applicable award agreements \ndefine \u201cCore Earnings\u201d to mean the Company\u2019s  \nnet income available to common stockholders,  \nexcluding, on a tax-adjustedbasis, the impact \nof (i) impairment or amortization of goodwill \nand intangible assets and (ii) the build or   \nrelease of the allowance for credit losses,   \ncalculated as the difference between the      \nprovision for credit losses and charge-offs,  \nnet of recoveries. The Committee believes that\nCore Earnings is an appropriate performance   \nmetric to employ for these performance-based  \nvesting provisions because the metric captures\nmajor operational costs and risks to the      \nCompany\u2019s business, including charge-offs,    \noperating expenses, market and competitive    \nrisks, and costs to maintain adequate levels  \nof capital and liquidity. The metric is based \non net income available to common stockholders\nand it also includes the impact of            \ndiscontinued operations.

These reductions will \noccur regardless of how well the Company\u2019s    \nAdjusted ROTCE compares to the Performance    \nShare Peers. If the Company does not achieve  \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for one year in the   \nperformance period, the total number of shares\nissued on the vesting date will be reduced by \none-sixth.If the Company does not achieve     \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for two years in the  \nperformance period, the total number of shares\nissued on the vesting date will be reduced by \none-third.If the Company does not achieve     \npositive Adjusted ROTCE for any of the three  \nyears in the performance period, the NEOs will\nforfeit the entire award. In this manner, even\nif we outperform compared to the comparator   \ngroup, the performance share awards are at    \nrisk of complete forfeiture if we do not      \nachieve a threshold level of performance on an\nabsolute basis.

The recoupment \nperiod covers compensation received during the\nthree fiscal years preceding the date that the\nBoard concludes or should have concluded that \nthe Company is required to prepare a          \nrestatement or when the Company is directed to\nprepare a restatement by a court, regulatory  \nbody or other legally authorized body. Process\nand Criteria for Compensation Decisions The   \nCommittee considers a number of factors in    \nmaking compensation decisions with respect to \nthe NEOs. The Committee relies on a range of  \nobjective data including Company performance  \ndata, peer comparator group performance data, \nhistorical pay information, data on specific  \nmarket practices and trends, stockholder      \nfeedback, and other relevant points of        \ninformation to inform its business judgment.  \nUse of Outside Consultants for NEO            \nCompensation The Committee engages FW Cook, an\nindependent compensation consultant, to assist\nin the design of the NEO compensation program.\nFW Cook assists the Committee in a number of  \nways, including proposing and evaluating a    \npeer comparator group, gathering relevant     \ncompensation data from the peer group,        \ndiscussing relevant market trends and context,\nand developing recommendations on possible    \nplan designs.                                 \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            89  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nThe Chief Human Resources Officer and other   \nmembers of the Company\u2019s Human Resources      \ndepartment assist the CEO in developing       \ncompensation recommendations for the NEOs     \nother than the CEO for the Committee\u2019s        \nconsideration. The Human Resources department \ntypically uses multiple surveys as sources of \nmarket compensation data. FW Cook also        \nprovides additional market reference points   \nthat the Committee and the Independent        \nDirectors use when evaluating NEO             \ncompensation, and other outside consultants   \nprovide information to the Human Resources    \ndepartment regarding market practices, trends,\nand research reports. The Human Resources     \ndepartment is responsible for analyzing the   \ninformation obtained from the outside         \nconsultants and presenting it to the CEO, who \nconsiders the information and makes his       \ncompensation recommendations for the other    \nNEOs to the Committee and the Independent     \nDirectors. A consultant from FW Cook is       \npresent at Committee meetings during which CEO\nand NEO compensation is discussed and provides\nmarket data as well as an independent         \nperspective regarding CEO and NEO compensation\npractices. FW Cook has no other engagement    \nwith, and performs no other services for,     \nCapital One other than the services described \nabove.

Peer    \nGroups Peer Group to Determine Level and      \nComponents of Compensation In order to        \nattract, retain, and motivate top executive   \ntalent and non-employeedirectors consistent   \nwith our compensation program objectives, the \nCommittee reviews data annually from a group  \nof peer companies that are similar in size,   \nbusiness, and industry to the Company. These  \norganizations are intended to represent the   \nmarketplace of companies with which Capital   \nOne competes for business and for executive   \ntalent. The compensation data from the peer   \ngroup is used to inform the Committee\u2019s       \ndetermination of the structure and the total  \ncompensation target values of the compensation\nprogram for the NEOs other than the CEO as    \nwell as the total level of compensation for   \nthe CEO. The peer comparator group is reviewed\neach year and adjusted, as appropriate, so    \nthat the peer comparator group companies      \nreflect Capital One\u2019s competitive business and\ntalent environment. The Committee examines pay\npractices and data for the peer group         \ncompanies as a source of benchmarking data to \nassess the competitiveness of our compensation\nlevels and pay components. As part of this    \nanalysis, a consultant from FW Cook presents a\ncomprehensive report to the Committee that    \nhighlights the size, scope, and performance   \ninformation from the peer companies across a  \nvariety of metrics and presents               \nrecommendations for changes to the peer group,\nas applicable. The Committee specifically     \nconsiders the Company\u2019s percentile rank versus\npeer comparator companies across the following\nfinancial and market metrics, including:      \n                                              \n  \u220eRevenue                                    \n  \u220eAssets               \u220eAdjusted ROA         \n  \u220eMarket value         \u220eCommon equity Tier   \n  \u220eNet income           1 capital ratio       \n  available to          \u220eCharge-offrate       \n  common                \u220eRatio of stock       \n  stockholders          price to tangible     \n  \u220eU.S. deposits        book value            \n  \u220eLoans held for       \u220eRatio of stock       \n  investment            price to earnings     \n  \u220eDiluted EPS          \u220eTSR                  \n  growth                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  90    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nAfter reviewing this information, the         \nCommittee recommends a final peer comparator  \ngroup to the Independent Directors for        \napproval. The peer comparator group is        \nreviewed each year and adjusted, as           \nappropriate, so that the size, scope,         \nperformance, and business focus of the peer   \ncomparator companies (i) reflect Capital One\u2019s\ncompetitive environment, (ii) mitigate market \ndata volatility, (iii) recognize the Company\u2019s\nfocus on technological innovations in the     \nbanking industry, and (iv) position the       \nCompany near the median with regard to the    \nsize of the companies in the group. For 2024, \nthe peer comparator group was the same group  \nas 2023 and included the following companies: \n                                              \n  \u220eAlly          \u220eGoldman       \u220eRegions      \n  Financial      Sachs (GS)     (RF)          \n  (ALLY)                                      \n  \u220eAmerican      \u220eJ.P.          \u220eSynchrony    \n  Express        Morgan         (SYF)         \n  (AXP)          Chase (JPM)                  \n  \u220eBank of       \u220eMastercard    \u220eTruist       \n  America        (MA)           Financial     \n  (BAC)                         (TFC)         \n  \u220eCitigroup     \u220eMorgan        \u220eU.S.         \n  (C)            Stanley        Bancorp       \n                 (MS)           (USB)         \n  \u220eDiscover                                   \n  Financial      \u220ePayPal        \u220eVisa (V)     \n  Services\u00a0      (PYPL)                       \n  (DFS)                                       \n  \u220eFifth         \u220ePNC                         \n  Third          Financial      \u220eWells Fargo  \n  Bancorp        Services       (WFC)         \n  (FITB)         (PNC)                        \n                                              \nThe Committee and the Independent Directors   \nbelieve that this peer comparator group       \nreflects the competitive environment for the  \nCompany, particularly the performance and     \nbusiness focus of the companies in the peer   \ncomparator group and the competition for      \nexecutive talent. As of December 31, 2024,    \nCapital One was positioned at or near the     \nmedian of the peer comparator group in terms  \nof total assets, loans, deposits, revenues,   \nmarket value, and net income. Peer Group to   \nDetermine Settlement of Performance Share     \nAwards For both the Financial Performance     \nShares and the TSR Performance Shares, the    \nCompany\u2019s performance on each metric is       \nassessed over the three-year period relative  \nto the Performance Share Peers. See           \n\u201cPerformance Share Award Peer Group\u201d on page  \n71 for a description and discussion of the    \nPerformance Share Peers. Tally Sheets In      \naddition to considering market data from our  \npeer comparator group (when available), the   \nCommittee also conducts an annual             \ncomprehensive review of tally sheets for the  \nCEO and each NEO which reflect all components \nof compensation and include total compensation\nand potential payouts. Each tally sheet       \nsummarizes multiple components of current and \nhistorical compensation. The tally sheets     \nassist with the Committee\u2019s understanding of  \nthe historical context that is relevant to    \ncurrent compensation decisions, such as the   \nCEO and each NEO\u2019s unrealized equity value.   \nOther Compensation Arrangements Pension and   \nNon-QualifiedDeferred Compensation Plans      \nCapital One does not have any active pension  \nplans for the NEOs. In 2024, each of our NEOs \nparticipated in Capital One\u2019s VNQDCP, which is\na voluntary, non-qualifieddeferred            \ncompensation plan that restores participating \nNEOs, excluding the CEO, to the level of      \nsavings they would have achieved if they had  \nnot been impacted by Internal Revenue Service \nlimits governing our qualified 401(k) plan. It\nalso allows the NEOs, excluding the CEO, to   \ndefer additional pre-taxcompensation to save  \nfor retirement. The CEO participates in the   \nVNQDCP on a non-voluntarybasis, as the        \ndeferred cash portion of his year-endincentive\nis mandatorily deferred in the VNQDCP for     \nthree years. Capital One periodically reviews \npension and other deferred compensation       \nprograms and practices at our peer comparator \ncompanies and across the financial services   \nindustry. We also review changes in the legal \nand regulatory environment pertaining to      \nretirement programs.                          \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            91  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nDetails of the VNQDCP can be found under      \n\u201cCapital One\u2019s Voluntary Non-QualifiedDeferred\nCompensation Programs\u201d on page 104. Employment\nAgreements Capital One typically does not     \nenter into defined term employment agreements \nwith the NEOs to maintain maximum flexibility \nin establishing separation terms at the       \nappropriate time and considering their current\ncircumstances. The Committee retains full     \ndiscretion to approve employment agreements on\nan exception basis and has done so for        \nexceptional circumstances in the past. None of\nthe current NEOs have an employment agreement.\nChange of Control Agreements Each NEO         \ncurrently employed by the Company is a party  \nto an agreement providing certain benefits if \nthe executive\u2019s employment terminates in      \nconnection with a change of control, as well  \nas compensation and benefits protections      \nduring the two-yearperiod following the change\nof control. The change of control agreements  \ndefine compensation and benefits payable to   \nNEOs in certain merger and acquisition        \nscenarios. The Committee designed these       \nagreements to provide the NEOs with some      \ncertainty and allow the NEOs to remain neutral\nand consider a full range of strategic        \ndecisions that are focused on maximizing      \nstockholder value. The change of control      \nagreements are also intended to allow Capital \nOne\u2019s businesses to operate with minimal      \ndisruption in the event of a change of control\nby providing each NEO with an incentive to    \nremain in their leadership role up to and     \nbeyond the transaction date. In addition to   \ncompensation and benefits protections during a\ntwo-yearprotection period after a change of   \ncontrol, the NEOs are entitled to severance   \nbenefits under the agreements if their        \nemployment is terminated as a result of (or in\nanticipation of) certain merger and           \nacquisition scenarios. Both eligibility for   \nparticipation and the structure of payments   \nunder these agreements are designed to be     \naligned with market practice in the banking   \nand financial services industry. Our program  \nis designed so that our stockholders are not  \nfaced with disproportionate severance costs   \nthat may impair potential merger              \nopportunities. In addition, our change of     \ncontrol agreements for executive officers do  \nnot provide for excise tax \u201cgross-up\u201dpayments.\nPost-Employment Compensation Practices The CEO\nhas no employment or severance arrangement    \nwith the Company other than the change of     \ncontrol agreement as described above. If an   \nNEO, excluding the CEO, separates from Capital\nOne, they are entitled to receive the amounts \nset forth in the Company\u2019s Executive Severance\nPlan, which provides for a payment of up to   \n30% of the NEO\u2019s then-current total target    \ncompensation plus a pro-ratedseverance bonus  \nbased on the NEO\u2019s target cash incentive in   \nthe event of involuntary termination without  \ncause. Additional benefits include partially  \nsubsidized health, dental, and vision benefits\nfor a period of up to 18 months through       \ncontinuation of health coverage (\u201cCOBRA\u201d), and\noutplacement services for a period of up to   \none year following separation. The Committee  \nmay exercise its discretion in approving      \nadditional amounts considering all relevant   \ncircumstances, including the NEO\u2019s term of    \nemployment, past accomplishments, reasons for \nseparation from the Company, potential risks, \nand the NEO\u2019s willingness to restrict their   \nfuture action(s), such as through an agreement\nnot to compete or solicit the Company\u2019s       \ncustomers or associates. In addition,         \nfollowing a separation from Capital One,      \ncertain equity-based awards will continue to  \nvest according to their original terms, as    \ndescribed under \u201cPayments Under Certain       \nTermination Scenarios\u201d beginning on page 107. \nCapital One has entered into agreements with  \ncertain NEOs that contain restrictive         \ncovenants related to confidentiality, non-    \ncompetition, non-solicitation,and ownership of\nwork product. For additional information, see \n\u201cRestrictive Covenants\u201d beginning on page 106.\nUpon retiring from the Company, associates,   \nincluding the NEOs, will have access to a     \nvariety of medical plans through a private    \nexchange.

Other      \nAspects of Executive Compensation Stock       \nOwnership and Retention Requirements          \nConsistent with their responsibilities to our \nstockholders, the executive officers are      \nrequired to maintain a significant financial  \nstake in the Company. To this end, the CEO and\nthe other NEOs must own shares of Capital One \ncommon stock with a fair market value of at   \nleast the following (\u201cStock Ownership         \nRequirement\u201d):                                \n                                              \n                 Ownership\u00a0     Post-Termin\u2026  \n  Role           Requirement    Ownership\u00a0    \n                                Requirement   \n  CEO            $10.5\u00a0         $5.25\u00a0        \n                 million        million       \n  Other NEOs                                  \n  and            3x\u00a0annual\u00a0     1.5x\u00a0annual\u00a0  \n  Executive      cash\u00a0salary    cash\u00a0salary   \n  Officers                                    \n                                              \nGiven that the CEO\u2019s compensation program does\nnot include a base salary, his Stock Ownership\nRequirement is based on an amount established \nannually by the Committee and the Independent \nDirectors. The CEO\u2019s Stock Ownership          \nRequirement is $10.5 million. In addition, the\nCEO and all other NEOs are required to        \ncontinue to hold 50% of their Stock Ownership \nRequirement for one year following            \ntermination, retirement, or ceasing to serve  \nas an executive officer, except in case of    \ntermination by death, disability, or in       \nconnection with a change of control. The      \nCommittee and the Independent Directors       \nbelieve that these Stock Ownership            \nRequirements have increased the alignment of  \nCEO and all other NEO compensation with       \nstockholder interests.

The Committee \nreviews the guidelines and monitors the CEO\u2019s \nand the other NEOs\u2019 compliance with them. New \nexecutive officers are given five years from  \nthe date of promotion to or appointment as an \nexecutive officer to comply with the Stock    \nOwnership Requirements. In the event that an  \nexecutive officer is not in compliance with   \nthese requirements, the Committee has the     \nright to take action, including reducing the  \nexecutive officer\u2019s compensation. The CEO and \nall other NEOs are currently in compliance    \nwith this requirement. The Company has stock  \nretention requirements for certain equity     \nawards made to the CEO and the other NEOs.    \nWith respect to awards of performance shares  \nand stock-settled RSUs that vest (i) during an\nexecutive\u2019s term of employment with Capital   \nOne, or (ii) as applicable, prior to the first\nanniversary of such executive\u2019s separation    \nfrom Capital One, each executive must hold 50%\nof the after-taxnet shares acquired (\u201cRetained\nShares\u201d) for a period of one year after the   \nacquisition date of the shares.

Prohibition of Hedging, Speculative \nTrading Activities, and Pledging As part of   \nthe commitment by Capital One\u2019s leadership    \nteam to maintain public confidence in the     \nlong-term growth of Capital One\u2019s stock,      \nCapital One maintains a policy prohibiting    \nhedging and speculative trading activities.   \nSpecifically, the policy prohibits certain    \nindividuals from engaging in short sales,     \nhedging transactions, or speculative trading  \nin derivative securities of Capital One stock.\nThe policy applies to all Capital One         \ndirectors, officers (as defined under Section \n16 of the Exchange Act) (directors and        \nofficers, together, \u201cControl Group Members\u201d), \nand associates who (i) serve at the Senior    \nVice President level or above, (ii) report    \ndirectly to a Control Group Member, or (iii)  \nare otherwise determined by Capital One\u2019s     \nGeneral Counsel to be an \u201cinsider.\u201d The policy\napplies to all shares of Capital One stock    \nheld by those persons covered by the policy,  \nregardless of whether the stock was granted as\ncompensation by Capital One or is otherwise   \nheld directly or indirectly. Capital One also \nprohibits its Control Group Members from using\nCapital One securities, including common      \nstock, in a margin account or pledging Capital\nOne securities as collateral for a loan.      \nInsider Trading Policy We maintain insider    \ntrading policiesand procedures governing the  \npurchase, sale, and/or other dispositions of  \nCapital One\u2019s securities by directors,        \nofficers, employees, and other covered persons\nthat we believe are reasonably designed to    \npromote compliance with insider trading laws, \nrules, and regulations, as well as applicable \nNYSE listing standards. A copy of our insider \ntrading policy was filed as Exhibit 19 to our \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K,filed with the SEC \non February 20, 2025. Equity Grant Practices  \nCapital One strives to maintain equity grant  \npractices that demonstrate high standards of  \ncorporate governance. Annual incentive awards \ngenerally are approved by the Committee and   \nthe Independent Directors (or by authority    \ndelegated to the Chief Human Resources Officer\nfor certain associates who are not executive  \nofficers) at regularly scheduled meetings in  \nthe first quarter of each year. The date of   \ngrant is the actual date on which the         \nCommittee approves the awards. The Committee  \nmay grant awards of restricted stock, RSUs,   \nstock options, or other equity awards outside \nof the annual incentive cycle. The Committee  \nhas delegated authority to the CEO to award   \nshares of restricted stock and RSUs, and to   \nthe Chief Human Resources Officer to award    \nstock-settled and cash-settled RSUs (but not  \noptions or other equity awards) to associates \nwho are not executive officers, subject to a  \nmaximum amount of $2 million for any associate\nin any one year with an aggregate $50 million \nannual limit. These awards are designed to be \nused for new hires and for special programs   \ndesigned by management to incentivize, retain,\nand reward current associates of the Company. \nThe Committee reviews all grants made by      \ndelegation at least once per year and approves\nall grants that exceed the annual delegation  \nlimit. With respect to awards of stock        \noptions, the exercise price is always the Fair\nMarket Value of Capital One common stock on   \nthe date of grant. Under the terms of our 2004\nStock Incentive Plan, \u201cFair Market Value\u201d is  \nequal to the closing price of Capital One     \ncommon stock on the date of grant. Item 402(x)\nof Regulation S-Krequires Capital One to      \ndiscuss our policies and practices on the     \ntiming of awards of options in relation to our\ndisclosure of material non-publicinformation. \nCapital One does notseek to time equity grants\nto take advantage of material non-            \npublicinformation and has never had a practice\nof doing so. Capital One does not currently   \ngrant stock options or similar awards.        \nAccordingly, we do notconsider the release of \nmaterial nonpublic information in relation to \nthe grant of such awards and do nottime such  \nrelease for the purpose of affecting the value\nof executive compensation.                    \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  94    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section V - Compensation Discussion and     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nTax Considerations The Committee carefully    \nconsiders the tax impacts of its compensation \nprograms on the Company, as well as on its    \nexecutives.

The grant date fair value for   \n       the 2024 TSR Performance Shares        \n       granted to Mr.\u00a0Fairbank is determined  \n       by multiplying the target number of    \n       shares by a valuation using a Monte    \n       Carlo simulation, which determined a   \n       grant date fair value of $142.35 per   \n       share (105.79% of the Company\u2019s        \n       closing stock price on the grant       \n       date). The valuation was based on the  \n       following assumptions: (i)\u00a0expected    \n       volatility based on the historical     \n       stock price volatility of the Company  \n       and the implied volatility of the      \n       Company\u2019s exchange-traded options      \n       (33.19%); (ii) expected risk-free      \n       interest rate based on the U.S.        \n       Treasury rates as of the grant date    \n       (3.94%); and (iii)\u00a0the length of the   \n       remaining performance period as of     \n       the grant date (2.93 years). For       \n       2023, the amounts shown also include   \n  (2)  the incremental expense from the       \n       amendment of the agreements for the    \n       Financial Performance Shares           \n       originally granted on February\u00a04,      \n       2021 to Messrs.

Prior to  \nNovember 1995, Capital One offered a Cash     \nBalance Pension Plan (\u201cCBPP\u201d) and an Excess   \nCash Balance Pension Plan (\u201cExcess CBPP\u201d) to  \nall full-time salaried associates and certain \nexecutive officers. Both of these programs    \nwere frozen in December 1995; however,        \ninterest continues to accrue on plan balances \non a quarterly basis for the CBPP and on a    \nmonthly basis for the Excess CBPP. We are     \ncurrently in the process of terminating the   \nCBPP. A notice of intent to terminate the CBPP\nwas distributed to plan participants on       \nJanuary 21, 2025 and a request for qualified  \nstatus determination was filed with the IRS on\nFebruary 13, 2025. Termination activities are \nexpected to continue through the first quarter\nof 2026. The CBPP interest rate changes       \nannually, based on the average yield of five- \nyear U.S. Treasury Securities for the month of\nOctober of the prior plan year and is         \ncompounded quarterly (4.85% effective annual  \ninterest crediting rate for 2024). The Excess \nCBPP interest rate changes monthly based on   \nthe Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and is     \ncompounded monthly (8.68% effective annual    \ninterest crediting rate for 2024). Mr.        \nFairbank participated in these programs. The  \nestimated annual payouts upon retirement in   \nthe CBPP and the Excess CBPP as of December   \n31, 2024, are $4,026 and $16,163,             \nrespectively, for Mr. Fairbank. As of December\n31, 2024, the \u201cPresent Value of Accumulated   \nBenefit\u201d for Mr. Fairbank for both plans is   \nequal to his account balance because Mr.      \nFairbank has attained the normal retirement   \nage of 65 and so is assumed to retire         \nimmediately under the actuarial valuation     \nassumptions. Since Mr. Fairbank is assumed to \nretire as of the measurement date, the future \ninterest rate does not apply. The account in  \neach plan is distributed after any separation \nfrom service. Distribution options from the   \nCBPP plan are lump sum (eligible for rollover \nto another qualified plan or personal IRA) or \nan annuity option. The Excess CBPP will be    \ndistributed in the same form as the CBPP, as a\nlump sum (not eligible for rollover) or as an \nannuity. Since the CBPP and Excess CBPP are   \naccount-based defined benefit plans, years of \nservice are not tracked.                      \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           103  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \n2024 Pension Benefits Table                   \n                                              \n                 Y\u2026        P\u2026        Pa\u2026      \n       P\u2026        of        V\u2026        Du\u2026      \n  \u2026    N\u2026        C\u2026        of        La\u2026      \n                 S\u2026        A\u2026        Fi\u2026      \n                           B\u2026        Ye\u2026      \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        C\u2026        7\u2026        $\u2026         $\u2014  \n  \u2026                                           \n           E\u2026        7\u2026        $\u2026         $\u2014  \n           C\u2026                                 \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014          \u2014        $\u2014         $\u2014  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014          \u2014        $\u2014         $\u2014  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014          \u2014        $\u2014         $\u2014  \n  \u2026                                           \n  \u2026        \u2014          \u2014        $\u2014         $\u2014  \n  \u2026                                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       In November 1995, Capital One amended  \n       the CBPP and the Excess CBPP to        \n       eliminate further pay-based credits    \n       to participants as of December\u00a031,     \n       1995 and to provide that there would   \n       be no new participants in such plans   \n  (1)  on or after January\u00a01, 1996.

Capital One has     \nasked certain NEOs to enter into various      \nagreements that contain restrictive covenants \nrelated to confidentiality, non-competition,  \nnon-solicitation,and ownership of work        \nproduct, as described below. Non-             \nCompetitionAgreements Messrs. Yajnik and Young\nhave entered into non-competitionagreements   \nwith the Company pursuant to which they may be\nrestricted as to what competitive services    \nthey may provide to an entity following       \nseparation from Capital One. These non-       \ncompetitionagreements provide for the         \nfollowing in exchange for the NEO complying   \nwith non-competitionrestrictions for up to two\nyears following an involuntary termination,   \nother than for cause, death, or disability:   \npayment equal to 15% of the NEO\u2019s total target\ncompensation for each year of enforcement and \nsubsidized health insurance premiums for a    \nperiod of up to 18 months through COBRA if the\nNEO is eligible and elects such coverage,     \nsubject to certain terms and conditions. The  \npayments are made in two lump sums: the first \nfollowing termination and the second upon     \nsuccessful completion of the enforcement      \nperiod. In the event of a voluntary           \ntermination, the previously described payments\nare typically made for the second year of     \nenforcement for agreements with a two-        \nyearenforcement period. Confidentiality, Work \nProduct, and No Hire/Non-Solicitationof       \nEmployee Agreement Messrs. Cooper, Yajnik, and\nYoung are parties to confidentiality, work    \nproduct, and no hire/non-solicitationof       \nemployee agreements. The confidentiality      \nprovisions of these agreements generally      \nprovide that at all times during and following\nemployment with the Company, these NEOs may   \nnot use for personal benefit or the benefit of\nothers, or divulge to others, any of Capital  \nOne\u2019s confidential information, except as     \nexpressly authorized by Capital One or        \nrequired by legal process. Messrs. Cooper\u2019s   \nand Yajnik\u2019s agreements also provide that, for\na period of two years following separation    \nfrom Capital One, they shall not directly or  \nindirectly solicit or induce any associate of \nCapital One to become employed by any person  \nor entity engaged in competition with Capital \nOne, and shall not directly or indirectly     \nsolicit or induce any associate of Capital One\nto end their employment based on confidential \ninformation learned about the associate while \nthey were employed by Capital One.            \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  106    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nMr. Young\u2019s agreement also provides that, for \na period of two years following separation    \nfrom Capital One, he shall not, directly or   \nindirectly, (i) solicit or induce any covered \nCapital One associate to become employed by   \nany other person or entity, (ii) hire or      \notherwise engage any covered Capital One      \nassociate (or a person who was a covered      \nassociate and resigned in the prior three     \nmonths) to work for or provide services to any\nother person or entity, or (iii) solicit or   \ninduce any Capital One employee to leave or   \ncease their employment with Capital One, or to\nhire or otherwise engage any Capital One      \nemployee to work for or provide services to   \nany other person or entity, if based on       \nconfidential information he learned about such\nemployee while employed by Capital One.       \nPayments Under Certain Termination Scenarios  \nUpon separation from the Company, the NEOs,   \nregardless of the reason for termination,     \nreceive certain earned, but previously unpaid,\npayments, such as accrued but unused vacation \npay, and amounts vested under the Company\u2019s   \nqualified and non-qualifiedretirement         \nprograms. In addition, cash-settled RSUs      \ngranted to NEOs, other than the CEO, after the\nend of a performance year continue to vest    \naccording to the original provisions of such  \ngrants upon involuntary separation for any    \nreason other than cause or as soon as         \npracticable following a \u201cdouble trigger\u201d      \nchange of control (as discussed below).       \nVoluntary Termination An NEO, other than the  \nCEO, who voluntarily terminates employment    \nwith Capital One may receive payments related \nto non-competitioncovenants (described above, \nif applicable) and any contractual payments to\nwhich the NEO may otherwise be entitled. In   \naddition, the NEO has the ability following   \nseparation to exercise vested but unexercised \noptions for three months following voluntary  \ntermination. Involuntary Termination Without  \nCause An NEO, other than the CEO, whose       \nemployment with Capital One is terminated     \ninvoluntarily, for performance or job         \nelimination, is entitled to receive the       \namounts set forth in the Company\u2019s executive  \nseverance plan (\u201cExecutive Severance Plan\u201d) in\nexchange for executing a release of claims    \nagainst the Company. For 2024, potential      \npayments under the Executive Severance Plan   \nwere 30% of total target compensation, plus a \nseverance bonus based on such NEO\u2019s target    \ncash incentive in the event of termination due\nto restructuring. Additional benefits include \nhealthcare continuation subsidy through COBRA,\noutplacement services, and any contractual    \npayments to which the NEO may otherwise have  \nbeen entitled. Further, an NEO, other than the\nCEO, whose employment is terminated           \ninvoluntarily without cause and not due to    \ndeath or disability may receive payments      \nrelated to non-competitioncovenants (as       \ndescribed above, if applicable). Generally,   \nperformance shares granted to NEOs will vest  \nin full, based on actual Company performance  \nand stock-settled RSUs granted to NEOs will   \ncontinue to vest, subject to the NEO\u2019s        \nexecution of a release of claims against the  \nCompany. In addition, NEOs can exercise vested\nbut unexercised options for two years         \nfollowing separation. If an NEO\u2019s employment  \nwith Capital One is terminated because of     \ndeath or disability, the NEO\u2019s unvested RSUs  \nand performance shares will vest in full based\non target Company performance. Payments Upon  \nRetirement As with all executives who are     \neligible for retirement, NEOs who retire from \nCapital One may receive the following amounts:\npayments related to non-competitioncovenants  \nas if they had terminated voluntarily (as     \ndescribed above); up to 18 months of          \nsubsidized COBRA coverage; any contractual    \npayments to which they may otherwise be       \nentitled; and, for Messrs. Fairbank and       \nYajnik, who became eligible to retire on or   \nbefore December 31, 2012, a retiree medical   \nsubsidy and access to a variety of medical    \nplans through a private exchange. Retirees    \neligible for subsidized retiree medical       \ncoverage receive funding through a HRA which  \ncan be used to pay for health care insurance  \npremiums or eligible claims expenses.         \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           107  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nUpon retirement, all RSUs continue to vest    \naccording to their original terms based on    \nactual performance, which, for stock-settled  \nRSUs granted, also includes performance-based \nvesting provisions. In addition, performance  \nshares granted to NEOs will continue to vest  \nafter retirement. For stock options, the      \nexecutive has until the expiration of the     \noption term to exercise vested but unexercised\noptions. Termination for Cause Generally, an  \nNEO whose employment with Capital One is      \nterminated for cause receives no additional   \nbenefits but is required to comply with any   \napplicable restrictive covenants related to   \nconfidentiality, non-competition, non-        \nsolicitationof associates or customers, and   \nownership of work product, as described above.\nIn addition, if terminated for cause, the NEOs\nhave the ability following separation to      \nexercise vested but unexercised options for   \nthree months. Change of Control Each NEO is a \nparty to an agreement (\u201cChange of Control     \nAgreement\u201d) that provides for certain payments\nin the event their employment is terminated   \nwithin two years following (or within one year\nprior to but in anticipation of) a change of  \ncontrol of Capital One, either involuntarily  \nwithout cause or voluntarily for good reason. \nAmounts payable in each of these scenarios are\noutlined below. Pursuant to the agreements, a \n\u201cchange of control\u201d occurs if one or more of  \nthe following events take place: (i) an       \nacquisition of 20% or more of Capital One     \ncommon stock or the combined voting power of  \nthe voting securities of Capital One by a     \nperson or group, (ii) certain changes in the  \nmajority of the Board, (iii) consummation of a\nreorganization, merger, share exchange or     \nconsolidation or similar transaction, sale of \nall assets or the acquisition of another      \ncompany, except where all or substantially all\nof Capital One\u2019s stockholders receive 50% or  \nmore of the stock of the resulting company, at\nleast a majority of the board of directors of \nthe resulting company were incumbent Board    \nmembers, and no person owns 20% or more of the\nresulting company who did not own such stock  \nimmediately before the business combination,  \nor (iv) approval by stockholders of a complete\nliquidation or dissolution of Capital One. In \nthe event of a change of control, we do not   \nprovide for excise tax gross-uppayments. In   \naddition, all equity awards granted to the    \nNEOs require a so-called\u201cdouble trigger\u201d for  \naccelerated vesting in connection with a      \nchange of control. Upon a change of control,  \nall equity awards continue to vest according  \nto their original schedule.

Fairbank. For 2024, our last completed     \nfiscal year:                                  \n                                              \n  \u220e    The Annual Total Compensation of our   \n       median employee was $97,398            \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The Annual Total Compensation of Mr.\u00a0  \n       Fairbank was $30,829,070               \n                                              \nAccordingly, the ratio of Mr. Fairbank\u2019s      \nAnnual Total Compensation to the median       \nemployee\u2019s Annual Total Compensation was 317  \nto 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate     \ncalculated in a manner consistent with Item   \n402(u) of Regulation S-K. In determining our  \nmedian employee for 2024, in accordance with  \nSEC rules we have concluded that it would be  \nappropriate to: (i) rely on the process we    \nundertook in 2022 to identify the median      \nemployee (as described in our 2023 Proxy      \nStatement), because we believe that since the \n2022 determination, there has been no change  \nin our employee population or employee        \ncompensation arrangements that would          \nsignificantly impact our pay ratio; and (ii)  \nsubstitute the median employee for 2023 with  \nanother similarly compensated employee for    \n2024. We determined the 2022 median           \ncompensated employee of our global employee   \npopulation of 54,555 as of October 1, 2022    \n(the \u201cDetermination Date\u201d) by comparing a     \nconsistently applied compensation measure     \nconsisting of salary, wages (including        \novertime), bonuses, and commissions paid to   \nour employees over the twelve-month period    \npreceding the Determination Date (the         \n\u201cEstimated Compensation\u201d). Based on the       \nEstimated Compensation of each employee, we   \nidentified a cohort of 61 employees,          \nconsisting of the employee with the median    \nEstimated Compensation value and the 30       \nemployees above and 30 employees below that   \nemployee (the \u201cMedian Cohort\u201d). We then       \nremoved ten employees from the Median Cohort  \nwho appeared to bear anomalous characteristics\n(such as participation in non-U.S.compensation\nprograms, a hire date during the fiscal year, \nor separation prior to the end of the fiscal  \nyear) that could significantly distort the pay\nratio calculation, and then identified the    \nmedian employee from the remaining employees  \nin the Median Cohort. The SEC\u2019s rules for     \nidentifying the median compensated employee   \nand calculating the pay ratio based on that   \nemployee\u2019s Annual Total Compensation allow    \ncompanies to adopt a variety of methodologies,\nto apply certain exclusions, and to make      \nreasonable estimates and assumptions that     \nreflect their employee populations and        \ncompensation practices. As a result, the pay  \nratio reported by other companies may not be  \ncomparable to the pay ratio reported above, as\nother companies have different employee       \npopulations and compensation practices and may\nutilize different methodologies, exclusions,  \nestimates, and assumptions in calculating     \ntheir own pay ratios.                         \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  112    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                          \n  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  \n                          \n                                              \n  Section VI - Named Executive Officer        \n  Compensation                                \n                                              \nPay versus Performance                        \nAs required by Section\u00a0953(a) of the Dodd-\nFrank Act, we are providing the information\nbelow to illustrate the relationship between\nthe SEC-defined compensation actually paid\n(\u201cCAP\u201d) and various measures used to gauge the\nCompany\u2019s financial performance in conformance\nwith Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K.

D+TBV is     \n       calculated as the ratio, expressed as  \n       a percentage, of (i)\u00a0the Company\u2019s     \n       tangible book value per share at the   \n  (4)  end of each year, plus total common    \n       dividends per share paid during such   \n       year, to (ii)\u00a0the Company\u2019s tangible   \n       book value per share at the beginning  \n       of each corresponding year.            \n                                              \nCAP versus Company TSR As shown in the chart  \nabove, the PEO and other NEO\u2019s CAP amounts are\naligned with the Company\u2019s TSR. This alignment\nis due to the Company\u2019s executive compensation\nprogram being composed of primarily equity,   \nwith 50% of PEO and approximately 84% of all  \nNon-PEONEO\u2019s total compensation for the 2024  \nperformance year being comprised of equity-   \nbased compensation, similar to prior years. In\naddition, a portion of PEO compensation is    \ndirectly linked to the Company\u2019s TSR and vests\nentirely on the Company\u2019s TSR performance     \nrelative to the Performance Share Peers over a\nthree-year period. CAP versus Net Income As   \nshown in the chart above, the Company\u2019s net   \nincome has varied over the measurement period.\nWhile net income has increased and decreased  \ndirectionally with PEO and other NEO CAP for  \ncertain years in the performance period, the  \nchanges are not proportionally correlated with\nCAP. This is due in large part to the large   \nportion of PEO and other NEO compensation that\nis equity-based compensation as well as the   \nsignificant volatility of GAAP net income that\nresulted from the pandemic and post-pandemic  \nperiods of economic volatility that were      \ncovered by a portion of the measurement       \nperiod. In addition, while net income is one  \nof several factors used to assess Company     \nperformance, the Company does not use net     \nincome as a primary metric to determine       \ncompensation levels or incentive plan payout. \nCAP versus D+TBV As shown in the chart above, \nthe PEO and other NEO\u2019s CAP amounts are       \naligned with the Company selected measure of  \nD+TBV. This alignment is partially due to a   \nlarge portion of PEO and other NEO            \ncompensation being comprised of Financial     \nPerformance Shares (as described on page 79). \nFor the 2024 performance year, 54% of PEO     \ntotal compensation and an average of 27% of   \nother NEO total compensation was granted in   \nthe form of Financial Performance Shares,     \nsimilar to prior years. For Financial         \nPerformance Shares taken into consideration in\nthe calculation of CAP, two-thirdsof the      \npayout of each Financial Performance Share    \nupon vesting is based on D+TBV for the years  \ncovered in the chart above. Company TSR versus\nPeer Group TSR As shown in the chart above,   \nthe TSR peer group is based on the S&P        \nFinancial Index, which reflects the Company\u2019s \nindustry sector. The Company\u2019s cumulative TSR \nwas above that of the S&P Financial Index     \nduring the period covered by the table above. \nThe financial services industry faced         \nchallenges and volatility over the measured   \nperiod including a pandemic-driven economic   \ndownturn, substantial changes in interest     \nrates, regional bank failures and the         \nresulting bank funding stress.

Each of the metrics is        \nconsidered in the award and/or payout of      \ncompensation awarded to our NEOs under the    \nexecutive compensation program for each of the\nperformance years shown in the tables above.  \nD+TBV and Adjusted ROTCE are both earnings and\nprofit-driven measures that have shown to be  \nstrong indicators of long-term stockholder    \nvalue.

The Audit  \nCommittee evaluates the independent registered\npublic accounting firm\u2019s qualifications,      \nperformance, and independence at least        \nannually and periodically considers whether to\ncontinue to retain our current independent    \nregistered public accounting firm or whether  \nto engage another firm. In connection with    \napplicable partner rotation requirements, the \nAudit Committee and its Chair are involved in \nconsidering the selection of the independent  \nregistered public accounting firm\u2019s new lead  \npartner. Additionally, Capital One adheres to \nthe requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    \nrelating to the rotation of partners engaged  \nin Capital One\u2019s audit by the independent     \nregistered public accounting firm. For 2025,  \nthe Audit Committee has appointed Ernst &     \nYoung LLP (\u201cErnst & Young\u201d) as Capital One\u2019s  \nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nErnst & Young has served in this role since   \n1994. The members of the Audit Committee and  \nthe Board believe that the continued retention\nof Ernst & Young as Capital One\u2019s independent \nregistered public accounting firm is in the   \nbest interests of Capital One and its         \nstockholders. The Board is submitting this    \nproposal to the vote of the stockholders as a \nmatter of good corporate governance. If       \nstockholders do not ratify the selection of   \nErnst & Young, the Audit Committee will       \nreconsider the appointment of Ernst & Young as\nthe Company\u2019s independent registered public   \naccounting firm. Even if the selection is     \nratified, the Audit Committee may, in its     \ndiscretion, appoint a different independent   \nregistered public accounting firm at any time \nduring the year if the Audit Committee        \ndetermines that such a change would be in our \nstockholders\u2019 best interests.

In addition to fees for an  \naudit or review in accordance with generally  \naccepted auditing standards, this category    \ncontains fees for comfort letters, statutory  \nand subsidiary audits, consents, and          \nassistance with and review of documents filed \nwith the SEC. \u201cAudit-Related Fees\u201d include    \nfees related to assurance and associated      \nservices that are reasonably related to the   \nperformance of the audit or review of our     \nfinancial statements and traditionally are    \nperformed by the independent registered public\naccounting firm, such as: compliance testing  \nand reporting; internal control reviews;      \nattestation services that are not required by \nstatute or regulation; and agreed upon        \nprocedure reports. \u201cTax Fees\u201d include fees    \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  122    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                 \n  AUDIT MATTERS  \n                 \n                                              \n  Section X - Ratification of the Selection   \n  of Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP as Our Independent     \n  Registered                                  \n  Public Accounting Firm for 2025 (Item 3 on  \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nfor corporate and subsidiary tax compliance   \nservices. \u201cAll Other Fees\u201d include fees for   \nservices that are not defined as Audit, Audit-\nRelated, or Tax and are not specifically      \nprohibited by the SEC. Audit Committee Fee    \nApproval Procedures The Audit Committee is    \nresponsible for approving all fees and terms  \nof engagement for audit, audit-related, and   \npermissible non-auditservices provided by     \nErnst & Young. The Audit Committee has        \nreviewed the fees paid to Ernst & Young and   \nhas considered whether the fees paid for non- \nAuditservices are compatible with maintaining \nErnst & Young\u2019s independence. The Audit       \nCommittee also adopted policies and procedures\nto approve services provided by Ernst & Young \nin accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and \nrules of the SEC promulgated thereunder. These\npolicies and procedures involve annual pre-   \napprovalby the Audit Committee of the types of\nservices to be provided by Ernst & Young. Any \nservice engagements that exceed these pre-    \napprovedlimits must be submitted to the Audit \nCommittee for specific pre-approval.If the    \nactual expenditure for pre-approvedservices is\nanticipated to exceed, or exceeds, the pre-   \napprovedcost levels by more than $50,000, the \nincremental amount requires separate approval \nby the Audit Committee. In 2024, all the Audit\nand Audit-Related Fees and related services   \nwere pre-approvedby the Audit Committee       \npursuant to the policies and procedures       \ndescribed above.

Each member of the Audit Committee is\n\u201cfinancially literate\u201d in the judgment of the \nBoard. No member of the Audit Committee       \nsimultaneously serves on the audit committees \nof more than three public companies, including\nthat of Capital One. Audit Committee Policies \nand Procedures The Audit Committee has        \nimplemented procedures to enable it to devote \nthe attention it deems appropriate to each of \nthe matters assigned to it under its charter, \nincluding candid communications with          \nmanagement and Ernst & Young, Capital One\u2019s   \nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nto discuss new auditing standards and emerging\naudit-related issues. In carrying out its     \nresponsibilities, the Audit Committee met a   \ntotal of 11 times during 2024. Pursuant to    \nCapital One\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines \nand applicable law, the Audit Committee is    \ncomprised solely of independent directors.    \nRequired Communications with Ernst & Young In \ndischarging its oversight responsibility      \nthroughout the year, the Audit Committee      \nproactively engaged with management and Ernst \n& Young on matters relating to Capital One\u2019s  \nfinancial reporting. The Audit Committee has  \nreviewed and discussed Capital One\u2019s audited  \nfinancial statements for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, and the assessment of the  \neffectiveness of Capital One\u2019s internal       \ncontrol over financial reporting, with        \nmanagement and Ernst & Young. The Audit       \nCommittee has also discussed with Ernst &     \nYoung the applicable requirements of the      \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board and \nthe SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee has \nreceived the written disclosures and the      \nletter from Ernst & Young required by the     \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board     \nregarding Ernst & Young\u2019s communications with \nthe Audit Committee concerning independence   \nand has discussed with Ernst & Young their    \nindependence from Capital One. Audit Committee\nRecommendations Based on its review and       \ndiscussions with management and Ernst & Young,\nthe Audit Committee has recommended to the    \nBoard the inclusion of the audited financial  \nstatements in Capital One\u2019s Annual Report on  \nForm 10-Kfor the fiscal year ended December   \n31, 2024, for filing with the SEC.            \n                                              \n                        Eileen Serra (Chair   \n                        and Audit Committee   \n                        Financial Expert)     \n                        Eli Leenaars (Audit   \n                        Committee Financial   \n  The\u00a0Audit\u00a0            Expert) Christine     \n  Committee:            Detrick (Audit        \n                        Committee Financial   \n                        Expert) Suni P.       \n                        Harford (Audit        \n                        Committee Financial   \n                        Expert) Craig         \n                        Anthony Williams      \n                                              \nThe foregoing Report of the Audit Committee   \nshall not be deemed to be soliciting material \nor filed with the SEC and is not incorporated \nby reference into any of Capital One\u2019s        \nprevious or future filings with the SEC,      \nexcept as otherwise explicitly specified by   \nCapital One in any such filing.               \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  124    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \nSection XII - Stockholder Proposal (Item 4 on \nProxy Card) Stockholder Proposal Requesting   \nShareholder Vote Regarding Lavish Golden      \nParachutes (Item 4 on Proxy Card) Capital One \nhas been notified that John Chevedden, 2215   \nNelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA     \n90278, intends to present a proposal for      \nconsideration at the 2025 Annual Stockholder  \nMeeting (\u201cStockholder Proposal\u201d). Mr.         \nChevedden has submitted documentation         \nindicating that he is the beneficial owner of \nno fewer than 100 shares of Capital One common\nstock. Stockholder Proposal The resolution    \nbeing submitted by Mr. Chevedden to the       \nstockholders for approval, if properly        \npresented, is as follows: Proposal 4 \u2014        \nShareholder Vote regarding Lavish Golden      \nParachutes FOR Shareholder Rights Shareholders\nrequest that the Board seek shareholder       \napproval of any senior manager\u2019s new or       \nrenewed pay package that provides for         \nseverance or termination payments with an     \nestimated value exceeding 2.99 times the sum  \nof the executive\u2019s base salary plus target    \nshort-term bonus. This proposal only applies  \nto the Named Executive Officers. This         \nprovision shall at least be included in the   \nGoverness Guidelines of the Company or similar\ndocument and be readily accessible on the     \nCompany website. \u201cSeverance or termination    \npayments\u201d include cash, equity or other pay   \nthat is paid out or vests due to a senior     \nexecutive\u2019s termination for any reason.       \nPayments include those provided under         \nemployment agreements, severance plans, and   \nchange-in-controlclauses in long-term equity  \nplans, but not life insurance, pension        \nbenefits, or deferred compensation earned and \nvested prior to termination. \u201cEstimated total \nvalue\u201d includes: lump-sumpayments; payments   \noffsetting tax liabilities, perquisites or    \nbenefits not vested under a plan generally    \navailable to management employees, post-      \nemployment consulting fees or office expense  \nand equity awards if vesting is accelerated,  \nor a performance condition waived, due to     \ntermination. The Board shall retain the option\nto seek shareholder approval after material   \nterms are agreed upon. Unfortunately some     \ncompanies only limit cash golden parachutes to\nthe 2.99 figure which means that there is no  \nlimit on noncash golden parachutes for which  \nshareholders have no voting power. This       \nproposal is relevant even if there are current\ngolden parachute limits. A limit on golden    \nparachutes is like a speed limit. A speed     \nlimit by itself does not guarantee that the   \nspeed limit will never be exceeded. Like this \nproposal the rules associated with a speed    \nlimit provide consequences if the limit is    \nexceeded. With this proposal the consequences \nare a non-bindingshareholder vote is required \nfor unreasonably rich golden parachutes. This \nproposal places no limit on long-term equity  \npay or any other type pay. This proposal thus \nhas no impact on the ability to attract       \nexecutive talent and does not discourage the  \nuse of long-term equity pay because it places \nno limit on golden parachutes. It simply      \nrequires that overly rich golden parachutes be\nsubject to a non-bindingshareholder vote at a \nshareholder meeting already scheduled for     \nother matters.                                \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           125  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XII - Stockholder Proposal (Item 4  \n  on                                          \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nThis proposal is relevant because the annual  \nsay on executive pay vote does not have a     \nseparate section for approving or rejecting   \ngolden parachutes.

The proposal would   \nharm stockholders by placing the Company at a \nsignificant disadvantage in attracting and    \nretaining talented executives. Moreover,      \npayments to terminated executives are subject \nto robust governance and Board and committee  \noversight. Finally, the proposal is           \nunnecessary because stockholders have a       \nmeaningful voice on executive compensation and\nhave voted in support of our compensation     \nprograms at very high levels, and the Company \nhas a demonstrated history of responsiveness  \nto stockholder feedback. Accordingly, the     \nBoard unanimously recommends that you vote    \n\u201cAGAINST\u201d the Stockholder Proposal. The       \nCompany\u2019s Severance and Termination           \nArrangements Already Provide Reasonable,      \nAppropriate, Market-Competitive Post-         \nTermination Compensation With Important       \nStockholder Protections. The Company\u2019s change \nof control and severance practices are        \nreasonable and generally consistent with the  \nCompany\u2019s peers and the market. These         \narrangements provide executives with          \nreasonable, market-competitive severance      \namounts in the event of a severance eligible  \ntermination of the executive. The arrangements\nalso provide for the vesting of outstanding   \nunvested equity awards previously granted by  \nthe Compensation Committee as part of the     \nNEOs\u2019 annual compensation. For additional     \ninformation on these arrangements and         \npotential payment amounts, see \u201cPotential     \nPayments Upon Termination or Change of        \nControl\u201d beginning on page 105. Notably, our  \nChange of Control Agreements with our NEOs and\nthe change of control provisions in our equity\ngrants protect stockholders by including a    \n\u201cdouble-trigger\u201d mechanism, meaning that the  \ncash payments and equity vesting would occur  \nonly when (i) a change of control is          \nconsummated, and (ii) the Company terminates  \nthe executive\u2019s employment without cause, or  \nthe executive leaves for good reason, within  \ntwo years following (or within one year prior \nto but in anticipation of) the change of      \ncontrol. In addition, the Change of Control   \nAgreements protect stockholder value by not   \nincluding a provision for the payment of      \nexcise taxes that may become due upon the     \nchange of control.                            \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  126    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XII - Stockholder Proposal (Item 4  \n  on                                          \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nMoreover, the change of control provisions in \nour equity grants protect stockholders from   \nmisaligned incentives in a change of control  \nsituation. Long-term equity compensation      \nserves an important purpose to maintain       \nalignment between management and stockholder  \ninterests. By protecting entitlement to that  \ncompensation during a change of control, these\nchange of control provisions protect these    \naligned incentives. The Executive Severance   \nPlan likewise includes important protections  \nfor stockholders. In order to receive any     \nbenefits under the plan, the NEO must execute \na valid release of claims against the Company.\nIf the NEO receives severance payments under  \nthe plan, the NEO must comply with            \nconfidentiality obligations, and would be     \nrequired to repay a portion of the severance  \npayment if, among other reasons, it is        \nsubsequently determined that the NEO\u2019s        \nemployment could have been terminated for     \ncause. Notably, our CEO does not participate  \nin the Executive Severance Plan. Given that   \nthe Company\u2019s existing severance and          \ntermination arrangements already provide      \nreasonable, appropriate, market-competitive   \npost-termination compensation with important  \nstockholder protections, this proposal is     \nunnecessary. Our Practices Are Consistent with\nMarket Practice for Large Financial           \nInstitutions and the Proposal Would Harm      \nStockholders by Placing Us at a Substantial   \nCompetitive Disadvantage in Attracting and    \nRetaining Executive Talent. Our severance     \nprograms and practices are consistent with    \nmarket practices for large financial          \ninstitutions. In addition, the arrangements   \nare fair and are designed to protect          \nexecutives financially if they are terminated \nthrough no fault of their own. They provide   \nreasonable and appropriate post-termination   \ncash compensation while giving the executives \nan opportunity to share in Company value that \nthey helped create as part of historical,     \nstockholder-approved annual compensation      \nequity grants. Given that these arrangements  \nare customary market practice, the Board and  \nits Compensation Committee believe that such  \narrangements are vital for recruiting and     \nretaining highly qualified executives. The    \nCompany operates a global enterprise in a     \nhighly competitive business environment, and  \ncompetes for talented executives with many of \nthe world\u2019s largest companies across business \nsectors. This proposal would impose           \nrestrictions on compensation arrangements that\nmaterially deviate from reasonable market     \nnorms, placing the Company at a competitive   \ndisadvantage in recruiting and retaining      \nqualified executives. Payments to Terminated  \nNEOs Are Subject to Robust Governance and     \nOversight. Our severance arrangements and     \nequity compensation plan are subject to the   \nongoing oversight of the Board and its        \nCompensation Committee. Our Compensation      \nCommittee engages an independent compensation \nconsultant to review external benchmarking    \ndata and assist in developing our post-       \nemployment compensation and benefits within   \nour broader executive compensation and benefit\nprograms. The Board reviews our executive     \ncompensation program, including provisions of \nour severance program, at least annually. In  \naddition, the Compensation Committee reviews  \neach executive officer\u2019s separation on a case-\nby-casebasis and exercises its business       \njudgment, with the approval of the Independent\nDirectors, to customize the terms of the      \nseparation in consideration of relevant       \ncircumstances, including the reasons for the  \nseparation, market competitive practices for  \ncomparable separation scenarios, and other    \nimportant considerations. We believe our      \nrobust governance and compensation setting    \nprocesses and procedures provide reasonable   \nand appropriate oversight over the post-      \nemployment compensation and benefits afforded \nto our NEOs. In addition, unlike most non-    \nfinancialinstitutions, our compensation       \nprograms are subject to regulatory guidance   \nthat banking organizations should ensure that \nthe structure and terms of any golden         \nparachute arrangements are appropriate from a \nsafety and soundness perspective.             \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2025\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           127  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  Table of Contents                           \n                                              \n                         \n  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS  \n                         \n                                              \n  Section XII - Stockholder Proposal (Item 4  \n  on                                          \n  Proxy Card)                                 \n                                              \nBecause payments to terminated NEOs are       \nsubject to robust governance and oversight,   \nthis proposal is unnecessary.

To provide transparency to      \nstockholders, we annually disclose our plans  \nand policies governing post-employment        \ncompensation for NEOs and the potential       \ntermination benefits that may become payable  \nto NEOs (see page 110). In addition, in each  \nof our last three annual \u201cSay On Pay\u201d votes,  \nthe Company\u2019s executive compensation programs \nwere approved by more than 93% of the votes   \ncast. Moreover, our equity compensation plan  \nhas been approved by our stockholders.        \nFurthermore, in the event of a potential      \nmerger, acquisition, or other similar event,  \nstockholders would have further opportunities \nto express their views on any compensation to \nour NEOs in connection with that transaction  \n(including the change of control              \narrangements). We also actively engage with   \nour stockholders throughout the year to, among\nother things, provide visibility and          \ntransparency into our compensation practices  \nand to receive feedback from stockholders     \nregarding those practices and other governance\nmatters.

Compensation Committee believes that      \ncertain measures not defined by GAAP,         \nincluding return on average tangible common   \nequity and tangible book value per common     \nshare, provide alternate measurements of our  \nperformance. In addition, these non-          \nGAAPmeasures are reviewed by the Compensation \nCommittee and the other independent members of\nour Board as part of their assessment of the  \nCompany\u2019s performance. We consider these      \nmetrics to be key financial performance       \nmeasures that management uses in assessing    \ncapital adequacy and the level of returns     \ngenerated.
