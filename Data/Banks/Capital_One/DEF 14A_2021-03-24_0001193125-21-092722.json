We\nbelieve our executive compensation program\nstrongly links rewards with both business and\nindividual performance over multiple time\nhorizons, which aligns our executives\u0092\ninterests with those of our stockholders\nwhile supporting safety, soundness and\nappropriately balancing risk. 2020 Company\nPerformance Each year the Compensation\nCommittee (\u0093Committee\u0094) and the Independent\nDirectors review and evaluate the Company\u0092s\nqualitative and quantitative performance and\nmake determinations regarding the\ncompensation of our NEOs based on Capital\nOne\u0092s pay-for-performancephilosophy. The\nCommittee seeks to directly link the\ncompensation of the NEOs with the Company\u0092s\nperformance, and the executives\u0092\ncontributions to that performance over\nappropriate time horizons. The Committee and\nthe Independent Directors have the\nflexibility to adjust compensation decisions\nfrom year to year to take into account\nCompany and individual performance, as well\nas evolving market practices. In 2020,\nCapital One delivered solid financial and\noperating results in the face of\nunprecedented challenges and uncertainty. The\nextraordinary events of the COVID-19pandemic\nshaped our 2020 financial results which\nreflected the near-shutdown of the global\neconomy and our own choices to drive\nresilience and manage risk. The significant\nshrinkage in credit card loan balances in the\nindustry, and at Capital One, drove a\ndecrease in Company revenues. In addition,\nthe sharp economic downturn at the outset of\nthe pandemic, combined with significant\nuncertainty about future recovery, drove\nlarge additions to our reserve for expected\ncredit losses in the first half of the year\nand lower earnings in 2020 as compared to\n2019. However, cautious consumer behavior,\ngovernment stimulus, customer forbearance\nprograms, and our own underwriting choices\nresulted in historically low realized credit\nlosses. Our stockholders saw their investment\nin Capital One decrease slightly in 2020;\nhowever, our stock price outpaced most large\nbanks and outperformed the largest benchmark\nof our bank peers, the KBW Bank Index, by ten\npercentage points.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0             \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT            3  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \nWe also made substantial progress on our\ntechnology transformation. Our long-term\ninvestments in technology, talent,\ninfrastructure, data, products and\ncapabilities are driving innovation and will\nincreasingly support growth and efficiency\nover time. In 2020, these long-term\ninvestments continued to drive results as we\nexited all of our data centers, strengthened\nour risk and control environment, and\nexecuted on key strategic imperatives. Our\nmulti-year transformation, combined with\nstrong execution during the year, enabled the\nCompany\u0092s swift and effective response to the\npandemic, including a seamless transition to\nremote work for almost all of our non-\nbranchand non-essentialassociates, and proved\ncritical as customers increasingly relied on\ndigital solutions for engagement and\nservicing. During 2020, we welcomed millions\nof new customers to Capital One, deepened our\nengagement with existing customers, and our\ncustomer advocacy scores remain strong. We\nattracted talented new associates and\nassociate morale and engagement, despite the\nstress and challenges of 2020, hit record\nhighs. We also supported non-\nprofitorganizations and communities through\nboth philanthropy and service and continued\nto make progress on our diversity and\ninclusion efforts. We believe our portfolio\nof businesses, and our disciplined\ninvestments in growth and transformation,\nwill result in a company with the scale,\nbrand, capabilities, and talent that position\nus for future growth and to deliver\nsustainable financial performance and long-\nterm value to stockholders. In particular,\nthe Committee and the Independent Directors\nspecifically considered the following\nquantitative and qualitative Company\nperformance when awarding compensation for\nthe 2020 performance year to our NEOs (1):\n                                              \n       Diluted Earnings Per Share (\u0093EPS\u0094) of    \n       $5.18, a decrease of 53% from          \n  \u220e    2019, driven by the significant        \n       increase to the allowance for credit   \n       losses resulting from the COVID-19     \n       pandemic and economic uncertainty.     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Net Revenue(2) of                      \n       $28.5\u00a0billion, a decrease of 0.3%      \n       compared to 2019.

At Capital One, we appreciate\nthat our investors share our passion for\ncultivating a board that encompasses the\noptimal mix of diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, skills, expertise,\nqualifications, and an unwavering commitment\nto integrity and good judgment, all in order\nto thoughtfully advise and guide management as\nthey work to achieve our long-term strategic\nobjectives. The Governance and Nominating\nCommittee, under the direction of its chair,\nwho also currently serves as the Company\u0092s\nLead Independent Director, assesses the\ncomposition of and criteria for membership on\nthe Board and its committees on an ongoing\nbasis. In fulfilling this responsibility, the\nGovernance and Nominating Committee has taken\na long-term view and continuously assesses the\nresiliency of the Board over the next ten to\nfifteen years in alignment with the Company\u0092s\nstrategic direction to determine what actions\nmay be desirable to best position the Board\nand the Company for success. The Governance\nand Nominating Committee considers a variety\nof factors, including the Company\u0092s long-term\nstrategy, the skills and experiences that\ndirectors provide to the Board (including in\nthe context of the Company\u0092s strategy), the\nperformance of the Board and the Company, the\nBoard\u0092s director retirement policy (as\ndescribed in the Company\u0092s Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines), the Board\u0092s view that\na resilient board should include members\nacross a continuum of tenure, and the belief\nthat valuable insights can be gained from\ndiversity among the Board\u0092s members across\ngender and race/ethnicity.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  12    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT         \n  CAPITAL ONE                                 \n                                              \nOver the last few years, the Governance and\nNominating Committee has held discussions\nregarding director recruiting plans on a\nquarterly basis, and has provided regular\nupdates to the Board on those plans.

and Nominating\nCommittee considers whether the Board\ncontinues to possess the appropriate mix of\nskills and experience to oversee the Company\nin achieving these goals, and may seek\nadditional directors as a result of this\nconsideration. Our director nominees have\nspecific experiences that, in the aggregate,\nmeet an articulated set of director skills\nestablished by the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee. These skills are not one-\ndimensional.Instead, these skills collectively\nallow our director nominees to leverage\nstrategic and forward thinking, pattern\nrecognition, and strong business acumen to\ninform Board discussions and create an\nengaged, effective, and strategically oriented\nBoard.

When evaluating\nincumbent directors, the Governance and\nNominating Committee also considers the\ndirector\u0092s performance throughout the year,\nincluding the director\u0092s attendance,\npreparation for and participation in Board and\ncommittee meetings, the director\u0092s annual\nevaluation, feedback received from fellow\nBoard members, and the director\u0092s willingness\nto serve for an additional term, as further\ndescribed in the section \u0093Annual Assessment of\nIndividual Director Nominees\u0094 on page 31.\nProcess for Stockholder Recommendations of\nDirector Candidates Stockholders may propose\nnominees for consideration by the Governance\nand Nominating Committee by submitting the\nnames and other relevant information as\nrequired by, and in compliance with, Capital\nOne\u0092s Bylaws, and further described in Capital\nOne\u0092s Corporate Governance Guidelines, to the\nCorporate Secretary at Capital One\u0092s address\nset forth in the section \u0093How to Contact Us\u0094\non page 50.

The Governance and\nNominating Committee will consider potential\nnominees proposed by stockholders on the same\nbasis as it considers other potential\nnominees. In addition, an eligible stockholder\nor group of stockholders may use Capital One\u0092s\n\u0093proxy access\u0094 bylaws to include stockholder-\nnominated director candidates in the Company\u0092s\nproxy materials for annual meetings of\nstockholders. Our Bylaws permit up to 20\nstockholders owning 3% or more of the\nCompany\u0092s outstanding common shares of voting\nstock continuously for at least three years to\nnominate and include in the Company\u0092s proxy\nmaterials director nominees constituting up to\ntwo individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever\nis greater) provided that the stockholder(s)\nand the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements\nspecified in the Bylaws. Director Independence\nExcept for our CEO, who is the Company\u0092s\nfounder, the Board has affirmatively\ndetermined that the other members of our Board\nare independent under Capital One\u0092s Director\nIndependence Standards, which have been\nadopted by the Board as part of Capital One\u0092s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines. The Board has\nconcluded this based on a thorough assessment\nof whether each of its non-managementmembers\nis \u0093independent\u0094 under these standards. These\nstandards reflect the director independence\nrequirements set forth in the listing\nstandards of the New York Stock Exchange\n(\u0093NYSE\u0094) and other applicable legal and\nregulatory rules, and also describe certain\ncategorical relationships that the Board has\ndetermined to be immaterial for purposes of\ndetermining director independence. The\ncategorical relationships the Board has deemed\nimmaterial for purposes of determining\ndirector independence are: (i) relationships\nbetween Capital One and an entity where the\ndirector serves solely as a non-\nmanagementdirector; (ii) transactions between\nCapital One and a director or a director\u0092s\nimmediate family (or their primary business\naffiliations) that fall below the numerical\nthresholds in the NYSE listing standards (or\ndo not otherwise preclude independence under\nthose standards), and that are ordinary\ncourse, on arm\u0092s-lengthmarket terms, and, in\nthe case of extensions of credit, followed\nusual underwriting procedures, present no more\nthan the normal collectability risk or other\nunfavorable features and are in compliance\nwith applicable legal and regulatory\nrequirements; and (iii) discretionary\ncontributions to charitable organizations,\nfoundations, or universities in which a\ndirector (or immediate family member) serves\nas an executive officer that in any of the\nlast three fiscal years do not exceed the\ngreater of $1 million or 2% of the\norganization\u0092s consolidated gross revenues.\nThe Board has determined that each of the\ndirector nominees (excluding our CEO) is\nindependent under these standards. The Board\nhas also determined that Aparna Chennapragada\nand Pierre E. Leroy are independent under\nthese standards during the period in 2020\nduring which they served on the Board. Ms.\nChennapragada resigned from the Board\neffective March 18, 2021 and Mr. Leroy will\nretire from the Board effective May 6, 2021.\nIn making these determinations, the Governance\nand Nominating Committee and the Board\nreviewed certain information obtained from\nnon-managementdirectors\u0092 responses to a\nquestionnaire asking about their relationships\nwith Capital One, and those of their immediate\nfamily members and primary business or\ncharitable affiliations and other potential\nconflicts of interest, as well as certain\ninformation obtained through internal\ndiligence conducted on Capital One\u0092s\nbusinesses related to transactions,\nrelationships or arrangements between Capital\nOne and a non-managementdirector or their\nimmediate family members, primary business or\ncharitable affiliations. Following this\nreview, the Board determined that the\nrelationships or transactions complied with\nthe Corporate Governance Guidelines and the\nrelated NYSE standards.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            19  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT         \n  CAPITAL ONE                                 \n                                              \n                                    \n  Biographies of Director Nominees  \n                                    \n                                              \n                        Richard\u00a0D.\u00a0Fairbank   \n                        Chairman, Chief       \n                        Executive Officer     \n                        and President,        \n                        Capital One           \n                        Financial             \n                        Corporation \u00a0 Mr.\u00a0    \n                        Fairbank is founder,  \n                        Chairman, Chief       \n                        Executive             \n                        Officer, and          \n                        President of Capital  \n                        One Financial         \n                        Corporation.

The\ndiverse backgrounds and experiences of our\ndirectors provide the Board with broad\nperspectives from which to determine the\nleadership structure best suited for Capital\nOne and the long-term interests of Capital\nOne\u0092s stockholders and other stakeholders. We\nbelieve that our existing Board leadership\nstructure, with Mr. Fairbank acting as CEO and\nChairman of the Board, provides the most\neffective governance framework and allows our\nCompany to benefit from Mr. Fairbank\u0092s talent,\nknowledge, and leadership as the founder of\nCapital One and allows him to use the in-\ndepthfocus and perspective gained in running\nthe Company to effectively and efficiently\nlead our Board. Capital One appropriately\nmaintains strong independent and effective\noversight of our business and affairs through\nour empowered Lead Independent Director; all-\nindependentBoard committees with independent\nchairs that oversee the Company\u0092s operations,\nrisks, performance and business strategy;\nexperienced and committed directors; and\nfrequent executive sessions without management\n(including Mr. Fairbank) in attendance. Lead\nIndependent Director Our Board believes that\nan active, empowered Lead Independent Director\nis key to providing strong, independent\nleadership for the Board. The Lead Independent\nDirector position, elected annually by the\ndisinterested independent directors upon the\nrecommendation of the Governance and\nNominating Committee, is a critical aspect of\nour

For an\nincumbent Lead Independent Director, the\nIndependent Directors also consider the\nresults of the candidate\u0092s annual Lead\nIndependent Director assessment, as described\nin \u0093Annual Assessment of the Lead Independent\nDirector\u0094 below. Annual Assessment of the Lead\nIndependent Director To support the\nIndependent Directors in electing a Lead\nIndependent Director, the Governance and\nNominating Committee oversees an annual\nprocess to evaluate the effectiveness of the\nLead Independent Director.

During this program,\nover a period of 18 months, new directors meet\nwith members of senior management from all of\nthe business and staff areas, as well as Board\ncommittee chairs, the Lead Independent\nDirector, and individual directors, to review\nand discuss information about the Company, the\nbusiness, the boardroom, and individual\ndirector roles and responsibilities. Our\ncontinuing education program then helps keep\ndirectors current on industry, corporate and\nother developments relevant to their work as\ndirectors by providing: (i) monthly updates on\ndirector education programs offered by\napplicable regulators, professional\norganizations, and academic institutions; (ii)\ninternal director education programs; (iii)\nvarious board-related publications to Board\nmembers; and (iv) access to peer-to-\npeernetworks. Our directors are also\nencouraged to pursue other educational\nopportunities, at the Company\u0092s expense, that\nmay enable them to better perform their\nduties. Executive Sessions Executive sessions\nof Independent Directors are led by the Lead\nIndependent Director and are an important\ngovernance practice because they enable the\nBoard to discuss matters, such as strategy,\nCEO and senior management performance and\ncompensation, succession planning and board\neffectiveness without management present. Our\nIndependent Directors meet in executive\nsession without management at least once\nannually and, in 2020, the Independent\nDirectors met fourteen times in executive\nsession.

The Board\nbelieves that in addition to serving as a tool\nto evaluate and improve performance,\nevaluations can serve several other purposes,\nincluding the promotion of good governance and\nthe integrity of financial reporting,\nreduction of risk, informing the Board\nrefreshment process, strengthening the board-\nmanagement partnership, and helping set and\noversee board expectations of management. In\nassessing their performance, the Board and its\ncommittees take a multi-year perspective to\nidentify and evaluate trends and assure\nthemselves that areas identified for\nimprovement are appropriately and timely\naddressed. To ensure the process stays fresh\nand continues to generate rich insights, the\nBoard follows a cyclical, programmatic\napproach when conducting Board and committee\nevaluations. This approach includes regular,\nholistic reviews of the evaluation framework,\nmethodology and form. While the Board and each\nof its committees conducts a formal evaluation\nannually, the Board considers its performance\nand that of its committees continuously\nthroughout the year and shares feedback with\nmanagement.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            29  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT         \n  CAPITAL ONE                                 \n                                              \nAs part of the Board\u0092s self-evaluation\nprocess, directors consider various topics\nrelated to Board composition, structure,\neffectiveness and responsibilities and the\noverall mix of director skills, experience,\nand background.

The Board\u0092s Role in Corporate\nOversight Our Board is accountable for\noversight of Capital One\u0092s business affairs\nand operations. In carrying out this\nresponsibility, among other things, the Board\noversees management\u0092s development and\nimplementation of the Company\u0092s (i) corporate\nculture; (ii) corporate strategy; (iii)\nfinancial performance and associated risks;\n(iv) the enterprise-wide risk management\nframework, including cybersecurity risk; and\n(v) succession planning for the Company\u0092s CEO\nand other key executives. COVID-19Pandemic\nDuring 2020, the Board was deeply engaged in\nthe Company\u0092s response to the\nCOVID-19pandemic. As the COVID-19pandemic\ndeveloped, a cross-functional team of Company\nmanagement was assembled to continuously\nmonitor the impact of the COVID-19pandemic on\nour business and implement necessary measures\nto appropriately manage risk. The Board has\nreceived frequent updates on the pandemic\u0092s\nimpact on market conditions and the Company\u0092s\nbusiness and associates, and reviewed with\nmanagement the Company\u0092s risk mitigation\nstrategies and business contingency plans.\nSince mid-March2020, this Board oversight\nincluded both formal and informal Board\nmeetings and updates regarding the Company\u0092s\npandemic response. Corporate Culture Capital\nOne believes that a strong ethical corporate\nculture is a key element of sound and\nsustainable corporate governance practices,\nbeginning at the top with senior leadership.\nThe Board plays a critical role in supporting\nand overseeing Capital One\u0092s corporate culture\nand setting the \u0093tone at the top\u0094 by adopting\npolicies, codes of ethics, and a philosophy\nfor hiring and compensation practices that\npromote ethical behavior, compliance with laws\nand regulations, including those pertaining to\nconsumer protection, effective internal\ncontrols and risk management, and sound\ngovernance. The Company\u0092s governance and risk\nmanagement programs also support a strong and\nsustainable culture in several ways, including\nthrough the governance framework, risk\nmanagement program, ethics program, and talent\nmanagement and compensation policies and\npractices. The Board and its committees have\nmany opportunities to oversee and engage with\nmanagement on the Company\u0092s culture throughout\nthe year including through, among other\nthings, (i) reviewing and overseeing Capital\nOne\u0092s strategy, including by engaging in\nconstructive dialogue with the CEO and senior\nexecutives on the alignment of the Company\u0092s\nculture with its long-term strategy during the\nannual Board Strategy Meeting (which is\nfurther discussed below under \u0093Corporate\nStrategy\u0094), (ii) reviewing and adopting\nemployment policies, compensation plans and\nincentive structures that promote effective\ninternal controls and governance practices and\noverall ethical behavior; (iii) reviewing and\ndiscussing with the Chief Human Resources\nOfficer the results of associate engagement\nsurveys (which include associate feedback on\nthe Company\u0092s culture, mission, and values),\nassociate retention and turnover rates, and\nthe Company\u0092s diversity and inclusion efforts,\nand (iv) approving and overseeing adherence to\nthe Company\u0092s Code of Conduct, and receiving\nregular reporting from the Chief Compliance\nOfficer on the Company\u0092s ethics program and\nassociate conduct. Corporate Strategy The\nBoard, in fulfilling its responsibility to\nmanage risk and maximize long-term stockholder\nvalue, is accountable for reviewing and\noverseeing the creation and implementation of\nCapital One\u0092s corporate strategy. The Board\nexpects management, with input from the Board,\nto develop, communicate, and implement a\nstrategy that allows Capital One to: (i)\ninvest in long-term capabilities and\nopportunities; (ii) secure competitive,\nendgame positions in our key businesses; (iii)\nattract and retain customers; (iv) grow\nresiliently; (v) promote ethical behavior and\ncompliance with applicable laws and\nregulations; (vi) withstand economic stress\nand market volatility; and (vii) conform to\nthe Board\u0092s established risk tolerance. These\nstrategies should deliver long-term benefits\nand returns to our stakeholders, including our\nstockholders, regulators, customers,\nassociates, and communities in which we\noperate.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  32    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT         \n  CAPITAL ONE                                 \n                                              \nThe development of Capital One\u0092s strategy is\nan ongoing, iterative process that includes\nengagement from and between the CEO, Division\nPresidents, the CFO, the General Counsel, the\nCorporate Secretary, the Chief Risk Officer,\nthe Chief Audit Officer, and the Board. Each\nyear, the full Board participates in an annual\nBoard Strategy Meeting that provides an\nopportunity for the Board to engage with the\nCEO and key senior leaders in assessing the\ncompetitive environment and Capital One\u0092s\nenterprise and divisional strategies, and to\nprovide effective challenge, feedback, and\ninput on the Company\u0092s long-term strategy and\ninvestments. In addition, the Board approves\nthe long-term strategic plan. As the year\nprogresses, the Board remains engaged in\noverseeing the implementation and monitoring\nof Capital One\u0092s strategy through updates by\nthe CEO on enterprise corporate strategy and\nby Division Presidents on business line\nstrategies and results. These updates\ntypically include business line performance\nand outlook, external and competitive trends,\nkey investment opportunities, and risk\nevaluation and mitigation strategies. This\napproach allows the Board to engage in\ninformed discussions with management regarding\nfinancial performance and trajectory, capital\nallocation, strategy implementation, and risk-\nmitigation plans, where appropriate. Financial\nPerformance and Associated Risks The Board\noversees the Company\u0092s financial performance\nby reviewing with management, on a regular\nbasis, the Company\u0092s quarterly and annual\nfinancial statements. The Audit Committee\noversees the integrity of the Company\u0092s\nfinancial statements by, among other things,\nobtaining independent assurance as to the\ncompleteness and accuracy of its financial\nstatements from an independent registered\npublic accounting firm, whose qualifications,\nindependence and performance it reviews on an\nannual basis. The Audit Committee also\noversees the integrity of the Company\u0092s\ninternal controls over financial reporting by,\namong other things, reviewing periodic\nassessments of the adequacy and effectiveness\nof the Company\u0092s financial controls performed\nby both the Company\u0092s independent registered\npublic accounting firm and internal audit\nfunction. In addition, the Board, either\ndirectly or through the Risk Committee, plays\nan integral role in the oversight of capital\nplanning and adequacy, funding and liquidity\nrisk management, market risk management,\ninvestment portfolio management, and other\nasset liability management matters. Risk\nOversight The Board believes that effective\nrisk management and control processes are\ncritical to Capital One\u0092s safety and\nsoundness, our ability to predict and manage\nthe challenges that Capital One and the\nfinancial services industry face and,\nultimately, Capital One\u0092s long-term corporate\nsuccess. The enterprise-wide risk management\nframework defines the Board\u0092s appetite for\nrisk taking and enables senior management to\nunderstand, manage and report on risk. The\nrisk management framework is implemented\nenterprise-wide and includes seven risk\ncategories: compliance, credit, liquidity,\nmarket, operational, reputation and strategic.\nManagement has developed risk appetite\nstatements with accompanying metrics which are\nmeaningful to the organization and reflect the\naggregate level and types of risk Capital One\nis willing to accept in order to achieve its\nbusiness objectives, clarifying both risks the\nCompany is actively taking and risks that are\npurposely avoided. The Risk Committee is\nresponsible for the oversight of enterprise\nrisk management for the Company, and is\nresponsible for reviewing and recommending to\nthe Board for approval certain risk tolerances\ntaking into account the Company\u0092s structure,\nrisk profile, complexity, activities, size,\nand other appropriate risk-related factors.\nWithin management, enterprise risk management\nis generally the responsibility of the Chief\nRisk Officer, who has accountability for\nproposing risk tolerance and reporting levels\nrelated to all seven risk categories. The\nChief Risk Officer is also responsible for\nensuring that the Company has an overall\nenterprise risk framework and that it\nroutinely assesses and reports on enterprise\nlevel risks. The Chief Risk Officer reports\nboth to the CEO and to the Risk Committee. The\nAudit Committee also plays an important risk\noversight function, and oversees elements of\ncompliance. The Compensation Committee\noversees compensation policies and practices\nto ensure balanced risk-taking as further\ndescribed in \u0093Risk Assessment of Compensation\nPolicies and Practices\u0094 beginning on page 34\nbelow. Finally, the Board as a whole oversees\nthe entire enterprise risk framework for the\nCompany, including the oversight of strategic\nrisk.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            33  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT         \n  CAPITAL ONE                                 \n                                              \nCybersecurity As a financial services company\nentrusted with the safeguarding of sensitive\ninformation, our Board believes that a strong\nenterprise cyber program is vital to effective\nrisk management. As part of its program of\nregular oversight, the Risk Committee is\nresponsible for overseeing cyber risk,\ninformation security, and technology risk,\nincluding management\u0092s actions to identify,\nassess, mitigate, and remediate material cyber\nissues and risks. The Risk Committee receives\nquarterly reports from the Chief Information\nSecurity Officer and the Chief Technology Risk\nOfficer on the Company\u0092s technology and cyber\nrisk profile, enterprise cyber program, and\nkey enterprise cyber initiatives. The Risk\nCommittee annually reviews and recommends the\nCompany\u0092s information security policy and\ninformation security program to the Board for\napproval. At least annually, the Board reviews\nand discusses the Company\u0092s technology\nstrategy with the Chief Information Officer\nand approves the Company\u0092s technology\nstrategic plan. In addition, the Risk\nCommittee participates in quarterly cyber\neducation sessions. Succession Planning Under\nthe Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board\nis responsible for maintaining a succession\nplan for the CEO and other key executive\nroles. The Board has in place an effective\nplanning process to identify, develop, and\nassess successors to the CEO and other key\nexecutives, and annually reviews these\nsuccession plans. Our Board believes that the\ndirectors and the CEO should work together on\nexecutive succession planning and that the\nentire Board should be involved. Each year, as\npart of its succession planning process, our\nCEO provides the Board with recommendations\non, and evaluations of, potential CEO\nsuccessors. The Board reviews the senior\nexecutive team\u0092s experience, skills,\ncompetencies and potential to assess which\nexecutives possess or can develop the\nattributes that the Board believes are\nnecessary to lead and achieve the Company\u0092s\ngoals. Among other steps taken to promote this\nprocess throughout the year, each of the two\nlevels of executives below the CEO, which\ninclude the CEO\u0092s direct reports, often attend\nBoard meetings and present to the Board,\nproviding the Board with numerous\nopportunities to interact with our senior\nmanagement and assess their leadership\ncapabilities. Additionally, each line of\nbusiness engages in succession planning for\nkey roles at least once per year. The Chief\nHuman Resources Officer reviews the line of\nbusiness succession plans. Our Board also has\nestablished steps to address emergency CEO\nsuccession planning for an unplanned CEO\nsuccession event. Our emergency CEO succession\nplanning is intended to enable our Company to\nrespond to an unexpected CEO transition by\ncontinuing our Company\u0092s safe and sound\noperation and minimizing potential disruption\nor loss of continuity to our Company\u0092s\noperations and strategy. There is also\navailable, on a continuing basis as a result\nof the process described above, the CEO\u0092s\nrecommendation on a successor should the CEO\nbecome unexpectedly unable to serve. The Board\nalso reviews annually the CEO\u0092s emergency\nsuccessor recommendations. As the risks\nrelated to the COVID-19pandemic became more\napparent, our Board proactively reviewed plans\nfor temporary emergency successors across key\nroles in the first quarter of 2020. The\ntemporary emergency succession plan is\nintended to identify the leaders who can\nassume the responsibilities in the immediate\nshort term to ensure business continuity, day-\nto-daymanagement of the team and business for\nour senior management and key roles. Risk\nAssessment of Compensation Policies and\nPractices The Compensation Committee oversees\nall of our compensation policies and\npractices, including our incentive\ncompensation policies and practices, with a\nview toward ensuring that such policies and\npractices encourage balanced risk-taking, are\ncompatible with effective controls and risk\nmanagement, and align with our business\nstrategy. Every two years, the Compensation\nCommittee reviews and approves the Incentive\nCompensation Governance Policy which applies\nto all Company associates and governs\nincentive compensation decisions. The\nIncentive Compensation Governance Policy\nprovides the framework for oversight of the\ndesign of incentive compensation programs. In\nsetting executive compensation, the\nCompensation Committee assesses each of the\nnamed executive officers against one or more\nperformance objectives specifically designed\nto evaluate the degree to which the named\nexecutive officers balanced risks inherent in\ntheir specific roles. The Compensation\nCommittee also implements additional risk-\nbalancing features for certain equity awards,\nas described in more detail in the\n\u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0094\nbeginning on page 54.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  34    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT         \n  CAPITAL ONE                                 \n                                              \nIn addition, the Compensation Committee\nreviews the Company\u0092s NEO and other senior\nexecutive compensation programs as well as any\nother material incentive compensation\nprograms. During these reviews, the\nCompensation Committee discusses the Company\u0092s\nmost significant risks, including the\nCompany\u0092s status with respect to managing\nthose risks and the relationship of those\nrisks to compensation programs. The review\nincludes discussion and analysis of risk-\nbalancing features embedded in these incentive\ncompensation programs and other actions taken\nby the Company to appropriately balance risk\nand achieve conformance with regulatory\nguidance. The Compensation Committee also\ndiscusses these programs with the Company\u0092s\nChief Risk Officer, Chief Human Resources\nOfficer and the Compensation Committee\u0092s\nindependent compensation consultant, as\nappropriate. Based on these discussions, the\nCompensation Committee believes these\ncompensation programs are consistent with\nsafety and soundness and operate in a manner\nthat appropriately balances risk. The\nCompensation Committee\u0092s active oversight,\ntogether with the Company\u0092s interactions and\ndiscussions with its regulators, has further\nenhanced the Company\u0092s risk management and\ncontrol processes with respect to incentive\ncompensation at the Company and supported our\ncontinued compliance with the interagency\nguidance on sound incentive compensation\npractices.\n                          \n  Stockholder Engagement  \n                          \nWe value the input and insights of our\nstockholders and are committed to continued\nmeaningful engagement with investors. As a\nresult, we engage in continuous outreach\nthroughout the year to discuss with our\nstockholders the issues that are important to\nthem, listen to their expectations for us and\nshare our views. During our discussions, we\nalso seek to provide visibility and\ntransparency into our business, our\nperformance, and our governance and\ncompensation practices. We report stockholder\nfeedback to our Board to help them respond to\nstockholders\u0092 concerns and feedback.\nStockholder Engagement Program In 2020, we\nengaged in direct outreach and discussions\nwith stockholders representing approximately\n70% of our outstanding shares. Key topics of\nfocus included environmental, social and\ngovernance matters, company strategy and\nresults, board composition, stockholder action\nby written consent, and executive\ncompensation. Key features of our stockholder\nengagement program include: (i) continuous,\nyear-round outreach; (ii) meaningful board-\ndriven engagement; (iii) regular board\nreporting; and (iv) stockholder-driven\nimprovements. Continuous Outreach Our CEO,\nCFO, and Investor Relations team meet\nfrequently with stockholders and the\ninvestment community. In addition, members of\nmanagement, including our Investor Relations,\nCorporate Governance, and Executive\nCompensation teams, as well as our General\nCounsel, Corporate Secretary and CFO, meet\nwith key governance contacts at our larger\nstockholders throughout the year. Meaningful\nEngagement Our goal is to engage in a manner\ncharacterized by both transparency and\nrespect, fostering collaborative and mutually\nbeneficial discussions. Depending on the\ntopics discussed with investors, our\nengagement with stockholders may include our\nLead Independent Director, the Chair of the\nCompensation Committee or the Chair of the\nGovernance and Nominating Committee (if\ndifferent from our Lead Independent Director).\nRegular Board Reporting The Governance and\nNominating Committee, Compensation Committee,\nand the Board request and receive reports\nseveral times a year from our Investor\nRelations team and members of management and\nactively discuss stockholders\u0092 feedback and\ninsights.

While our approach to\ncorporate social responsibility continues to\nevolve, each year we remain focused on three\ncore elements: our people, our community, and\nour environmental footprint.

Oversight of Environmental,\nSocial and Governance Matters Our\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (\u0093ESG\u0094)\napproach is integrated into each of our lines\nof business and helps define how we pursue\nbusiness opportunities and manage risk. Our\nCorporate Social Responsibility (\u0093CSR\u0094) team\nworks with colleagues throughout the Company\non an ongoing basis to shape our efforts and\nmonitor progress on key ESG issues. To\nstrengthen our oversight of ESG issues, in\n2020 we established a cross-functional ESG\nAdvisory Committee, which is a management-\nlevel committee led by senior executives from\nacross the Company and chaired by our\nCorporate Secretary, that meets monthly to\nhelp guide our Company\u0092s ESG initiatives.

In       \n       2020, Capital One announced an         \n       ongoing commitment                     \n       of $10\u00a0million to organizations        \n       advancing the cause of social justice  \n       for Black communities.

In March 2020, as the        \n       devastating effects of the COVID-19    \n       pandemic spread across the nation,     \n       Capital One quickly mobilized and      \n       committed $50\u00a0million to help address  \n       the rapidly                            \n       changing needs of our communities      \n       impacted by the pandemic. Working      \n       with our trusted nonprofit partners,   \n       Capital One expedited resources        \n       through partner relief grants with a   \n  \u220e    focus on supporting pressing needs     \n       around food and hunger relief,         \n       housing                                \n       and shelter security, support to       \n       small business owners, and assistance  \n       for low-income individuals in the      \n       communities in which our customers     \n       and associates live. Further, Capital  \n       One\u0092s effort extends to                 \n       supporting digital capabilities and    \n       access, student support and            \n       education, and financial stability     \n       programs \u0097 while also exploring new     \n       ways to use our company\u0092s assets to     \n       meet changing needs.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       FutureEdge. 2020 marked the            \n       completion of our signature            \n       FutureEdge program, a                  \n  \u220e    $150\u00a0million investment in our         \n       communities over five years to         \n       encourage job skills development for   \n       the 21st century;                      \n                                              \n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  48    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT         \n  CAPITAL ONE                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  support small businesses in their           \n  development; and provide financial          \n  education and money management support.

We      \n       manage a $5.7\u00a0billion loan and         \n       investment portfolio focused on        \n       affordable rental housing, through     \n       which we provide capital to            \n       finance affordable housing             \n       developments built by nonprofits,      \n       local agencies, and specialty          \n       developers and bring financial         \n       expertise to developments with         \n       multiple public and private funding    \n       sources. This allows us to address     \n  \u220e    critical community needs               \n       through customization and innovation.  \n       Since the inception of the Community   \n       Finance team in 2007, over 150,000     \n       households have benefited from units   \n       financed by Capital One, including     \n       nearly 14,000 units in 2020 alone,     \n       and more than 170,000 jobs have        \n       been created along the way.

Capital One  \n       has established an internal price on   \n       carbon                                 \n       starting at $15.00 per metric ton of   \n       carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2e,    \n       for Scope 1, 2 and verified Scope 3    \n       (in categories 1-14) emissions. Scope  \n       1                                      \n       emissions are direct emissions from    \n       our operations. Scope 2 emissions are  \n       indirect emissions from purchased      \n       power used to run our business. Scope  \n       3 emissions in categories 1-14 are     \n  \u220e    other indirect emissions               \n       that result from the conduct of our    \n       business. This carbon fee creates a    \n       monetary value on emissions in our     \n       carbon footprint, which creates a      \n       financial incentive for us to reduce   \n       emissions while establishing a         \n       dedicated revenue stream to fund our   \n       carbon reduction efforts and           \n       sustainability initiatives. This fee   \n       was incorporated into our 2021 budget  \n       and is currently funding on-site       \n       solar and energy efficiency projects   \n       at certain of our office locations.    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Reducing Greenhouse Gas (\u0093GHG\u0094)          \n       Emissions.

We believe that      \n  \u220e    renewable energy is a critical tool    \n       in addressing climate change, and in   \n       2018 Capital One joined other leading  \n       global companies and became a member   \n       of                                     \n       RE100, a global initiative of          \n       businesses committed to 100%           \n       renewable electricity.                 \n                                              \n                                              \n       Reducing Water Consumption.

The Board may grant an\nexception for any case where this requirement\nwould impose a financial hardship on a\ndirector. In 2020, no directors were granted\nan exception to this requirement for any\noutstanding awards of RSUs.

The extraordinary\nevents of the COVID-19pandemic shaped our 2020\nfinancial results which reflected the the\nnear-shutdown of the global economy and our\nown choices to drive resilience and manage\nrisk. The significant shrinkage in credit card\nloan balances in the industry, and at Capital\nOne, drove a decrease in Company revenues. In\naddition, the sharp economic downturn at the\noutset of the pandemic, combined with\nsignificant uncertainty about future recovery,\ndrove large additions to our reserve for\nexpected credit losses in the first half of\nthe year and lower earnings in 2020 as\ncompared to 2019. However, cautious consumer\nbehavior, government stimulus, customer\nforbearance programs, and our own underwriting\nchoices resulted in historically low realized\ncredit losses. Capital One showed only\nmoderate changes across other measures of\nfinancial performance compared to 2019, and\neach of our major lines of business remained\nresilient under stress. We reimagined how we\nworked, accommodated customer and associate\nneeds, and played an important role in\nsustaining economic activity for our customers\nand communities. Our stockholders saw their\ninvestment in Capital One decrease slightly in\n2020; however, our stock price outpaced most\nlarge banks and outperformed the largest\nbenchmark of our bank peers, the KBW Bank\nIndex, by ten percentage points. We also made\nsubstantial progress on our technology\ntransformation. Our long-term investments in\ntechnology, talent, infrastructure, data,\nproducts and capabilities are driving\ninnovation and will increasingly support\ngrowth and efficiency over time. In 2020,\nthese long-term investments continued to drive\nresults as we exited all of our data centers,\nstrengthened our risk and control environment\nand executed on key strategic imperatives. Our\nmulti-year transformation combined with strong\nexecution during the year enabled the\nCompany\u0092s swift and effective response to the\npandemic, including a seamless transition to\nremote work for almost all of our non-\nbranchand non-essentialassociates, and proved\ncritical as customers increasingly relied on\ndigital solutions for engagement and\nservicing.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            55  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nDuring 2020, we welcomed millions of new\ncustomers to Capital One, deepened our\nengagement with existing customers, and our\ncustomer advocacy scores remain strong. We\nattracted talented new associates and invested\nin new associate benefit and well-being\nprograms such as increased family care time\nand expanded health coverage for COVID-related\nillnesses. We supported non-\nprofitorganizations and communities through\nboth philanthropy and service. We also\ncontinued to make progress on our diversity\nand inclusion efforts related to growing\nexecutive representation, increasing diversity\nawareness and capabilities among associates\nand leaders, and supporting community partners\nwho specialize in racial equity. Capital One\ncontinues to be recognized as being a great\nplace to work, and associate morale and\nengagement, despite the stress and challenges\nof 2020, hit record highs. We believe our\nportfolio of businesses, and our disciplined\ninvestments in growth and transformation, will\nresult in a company with the scale, brand,\ncapabilities, and talent to position us for\nfuture growth and deliver sustainable\nfinancial performance and long-term value to\nstockholders. Each year the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors review and evaluate the\nCompany\u0092s qualitative and quantitative\nperformance and make determinations regarding\nthe compensation of our named executive\nofficers based on Capital One\u0092s pay-for-\nperformancephilosophy. The Committee\u0092s top\npriority is to implement a compensation\nprogram that aligns the interests of our named\nexecutive officers with the interests of our\nstockholders. See \u0093Consideration of\nStockholder Feedback and 2020 Say on Pay Vote\u0094\nbeginning on page 61 for information regarding\nenhancements made to our executive\ncompensation programs and disclosures as a\nresult of stockholder feedback. The Committee\nalso seeks to directly link the compensation\nof the NEOs with the Company\u0092s performance,\nand the executives\u0092 contributions to that\nperformance over appropriate time horizons,\nwhile supporting safety, soundness and\nappropriately balancing risk. The Committee\nand the Independent Directors have the\nflexibility to adjust compensation decisions\nfrom year to year to take into account Company\nand individual performance, as well as\nevolving market practices and external\nbenchmarks.

At our\n2020 Annual Stockholder Meeting, 69% of our\nstockholders supported our executive\ncompensation program by approving our non-\nbindingadvisory vote on executive compensation\n(\u00932020 Say on Pay Vote\u0094). Recognizing that the\n2020 Say on Pay vote reflected some level of\ninvestor concern for the Company\u0092s executive\ncompensation programs, we continued to\nstrengthen our outreach to stockholders to\nmaintain strong lines of communication with\nour stockholders and shared stockholders\u0092\nperspectives with the Committee and the Board.\nIn 2020, management directly engaged with\nstockholders representing approximately 70% of\nour outstanding shares in over 150\ninteractions with investors. See \u0093Stockholder\nEngagement Program\u0094 beginning on page 35 for\nmore information. From this outreach, the\nCommittee and the Board gained valuable\ninsight into our investors\u0092 views about the\nCompany, including our executive compensation\nprograms. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors considered these views and feedback\nin approving year-endincentive awards for 2020\nand structuring and approving the 2021\ncompensation programs for the NEOs. For 2021,\nas a direct result of the feedback received\nfrom investors during the 2020 outreach, the\nCommittee made the following changes to our\nexecutive compensation programs and\ndisclosure:\n                                              \n       Linked a Portion of CEO Compensation   \n       Directly to TSR. Several stockholders  \n       expressed                              \n       that TSR is an important element of    \n       Company performance and asked that     \n       the Company consider a more direct     \n       link between CEO compensation and the  \n       Company\u0092s TSR over time. Beginning      \n       with the 2020 performance year, the    \n       Committee and the Independent          \n       Directors determined to award a        \n       portion of the CEO\u0092s Year-End           \n       Incentive in the form of a             \n       performance share award that vests     \n       entirely based on the Company\u0092s TSR     \n  \u220e    over a three-year performance period   \n       relative to the Performance Share      \n       Peers. While TSR has been, and         \n       continues to be, explicitly included   \n       in the financial and operating         \n       performance factors considered by the  \n       Committee and the Independent          \n       Directors to determine all NEO         \n       year-end incentive awards, the         \n       Committee and the Independent          \n       Directors believe that linking a       \n       portion of CEO long-term compensation  \n       entirely to the Company\u0092s three-year    \n       TSR further aligns the interests of    \n       our CEO with the interests of          \n       stockholders over time.                \n                                              \n                                              \n       Disclosure of Performance Share        \n       Awards Realized Compensation. Several  \n       stockholders                           \n       expressed a desire for clearer         \n       information regarding the realized     \n       pay associated with the performance    \n       share awards granted to the NEOs. We   \n       added disclosure regarding the         \n       settlement value resulting from the    \n       performance share awards that vested   \n       in                                     \n       2021 based on the Company\u0092s             \n       performance for the three-year         \n       performance period from January\u00a01,     \n       2018 to December\u00a031, 2020.

We received feedback   \n       from                                   \n       stockholders regarding the             \n       composition of our Board-approved      \n       peer group used to determine the       \n       level and components of NEO            \n       compensation. In July 2020, the        \n  \u220e    Committee and the Independent          \n       Directors increased the size and       \n       diversity of the Company\u0092s              \n       peer group to add seven additional     \n       peers, including diversified           \n       financial institutions and payment     \n       companies with whom we compete for     \n       executive talent. See \u0093Peer Groups\u0094      \n       beginning on page 87 for more          \n       information.                           \n                                              \nIn recent years, as a result of the feedback\nreceived from investors, the Committee has\nmade the following enhancements to our\nexecutive compensation programs and\ndisclosure:\n                                              \n       Increased Alignment of CEO Pay and     \n       Performance. Beginning with the 2019   \n       performance                            \n       year, the Committee and the            \n       Independent Directors increased the    \n       alignment of CEO compensation with     \n       Company performance and stockholder    \n       interests by decreasing the amount of  \n       the CEO\u0092s compensation awarded at the   \n       beginning of the performance year      \n       such that the vast majority of CEO     \n       compensation is tied to a year-end     \n       evaluation of CEO and Company          \n       performance. The Committee and the     \n       Independent Directors believe that     \n       this structure further aligns          \n       Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u0092s compensation with that   \n  \u220e    of the Company\u0092s peers and provides a   \n       greater opportunity for the Committee  \n       and the Independent Directors to       \n       assess the Company and the CEO\u0092s        \n       performance after the completion of    \n       the                                    \n       performance year. In addition, this    \n       structure enhances the Committee and   \n       the Independent Directors\u0092 ability to   \n       incorporate feedback from              \n       stockholders received during the year  \n       to ensure that the CEO\u0092s performance    \n       year compensation                      \n       appropriately reflects the Company\u0092s    \n       compensation philosophy and            \n       principles and business results. See   \n       \u00932020 CEO Compensation Program\u0094          \n       beginning on page 65 for more          \n       information.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       Performance Share Award Metrics. In    \n       2018, we replaced Return on Assets     \n       with Common                            \n       Dividends + Growth of Tangible Book    \n       Value per Share (\u0093D+TBV\u0094) and Adjusted   \n       ROTCE, each as defined under           \n       \u0093Performance Share Award Metrics\u0094 on     \n       page 69, as the metrics for            \n       performance shares awarded to the      \n       NEOs. The Committee and                \n       the Independent Directors believe      \n       that these two performance metrics,    \n  \u220e    in combination, provide a balanced     \n       and rigorous measurement of Company    \n       performance by balancing the creation  \n       of long-term stockholder value and     \n       the returns generated on               \n       stockholders\u0092 investment in the         \n       Company. The first of the performance  \n       shares granted based on these new      \n       metrics settled in March 2021 at       \n       116.67% of the grant date target       \n       value of the awards as described       \n       under \u0093Settlement of Performance        \n       Shares Granted in February 2018\u0094        \n       beginning on page 77.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n       Simplified NEO Compensation Program.   \n       In 2018, the Committee and the         \n       Independent                            \n       Directors modified the compensation    \n       program applicable to our NEOs, other  \n       than our CEO, to reduce the number of  \n  \u220e    compensation vehicles by eliminating   \n       stock options and cash-settled RSUs    \n       and more closely aligning the program  \n       vehicles and structure to              \n       the programs used by the Company\u0092s      \n       peers.

granted\nto all executive officers and not just the\nNEOs. Compensation Program Objectives Capital\nOne\u0092s executive compensation program has four\nprimary objectives. Strongly link pay and\nperformance by providing compensation based on\nboth business and individual performance while\nappropriately balancing risk Capital One\nemphasizes pay-for-performanceat all\norganizational levels. Typically, as an\nexecutive\u0092s level of responsibility increases,\nso does the proportion of the executive\u0092s pay\nthat is subject to performance criteria.\nTherefore, the NEOs have the highest\nproportion of their pay directly linked to\nCompany and individual performance, as\ncompared to other associates. Awards made to\nthe NEOs in February 2021 for the 2020\nperformance year were based on Company and\nindividual performance, and on demonstrating\nspecific leadership competencies assessed\nthrough a comprehensive performance management\nprocess that included an individual assessment\nspecifically designed to evaluate the degree\nto which the executive balanced risks inherent\nto his or her role. The Chief Risk Officer\ncompiled these risk assessments and the Chief\nHuman Resources Officer\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            63  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nreviewed the assessments for the NEOs.\nSeparately, the Chief Auditor compiled and\nreviewed the risk assessment for the Chief\nRisk Officer. The Committee considered the\nassessments in making its determinations\nregarding individual performance and\ncompensation levels. Align our executives\u0092\ninterests with those of our stockholders The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors are\ncommitted to designing incentive compensation\nprograms that reward individual and Company\nperformance and that are aligned with the\ncreation of stockholder value over the long\nterm. Beginning with the 2020 performance\nyear, a portion of the CEO\u0092s performance share\naward will be linked to the Company\u0092s relative\nTSR over a three-year period. Because NEO\ncompensation is primarily delivered through\ndeferred, equity-based vehicles that vest over\nmultiple time horizons, the NEOs have a\nsignificant stake in the success of the\nCompany. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors also have the flexibility to adjust\ncompensation decisions from year to year to\ntake into account the Company\u0092s performance\nand evolving market practices. In addition, we\nhave established specific stock ownership\npolicies that the NEOs must meet and stock\nretention provisions applicable to certain\nequity awards. Reward performance over\nmultiple time horizons Our compensation\nprograms are structured to encourage our\nexecutives to deliver strong results over the\nshort term while making decisions that create\nsustained value for our stockholders over the\nlong term. For 2020, approximately 84% of the\nCEO\u0092s total compensation was equity-based and\nat-riskto the performance of the Company\u0092s\nstock price, and 100% of his compensation was\ndeferred for a three-year period. In addition,\napproximately 55% of total compensation for\nNEOs other than the CEO was provided through\nequity-based vehicles which were at-riskto the\nperformance of the Company\u0092s stock price and\nsubject to vesting over multiple time\nhorizons. The use of deferred, equity-based\ncompensation vehicles with multi-year vesting\nterms advances our goal of aligning the\nultimate value realized by the NEOs with the\nperformance of the Company\u0092s stock over time\nbecause the value of these compensation\nvehicles increases and decreases based on the\nperformance of the Company\u0092s stock price in\nboth current and future periods. Attract,\nretain and motivate top executive talent To\nattract, retain and motivate exceptional\nleaders, we believe that compensation\nopportunities at Capital One must be\ncompetitive with the marketplace for talent.\nThe Committee and the Independent Directors\nstrive to preserve a competitive pay mix and\ntotal target compensation values in the\nexecutive compensation program, as well as\nprovide competitive total rewards based on our\nselected peer group. See \u0093Peer Groups\u0094\nbeginning on page 87 for information regarding\nhow the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors utilized the Company\u0092s peer group in\ndetermining executive compensation. Use of\nJudgment The Committee believes that\nexercising judgment is an important element in\nreaching balanced compensation decisions that\nare consistent with our strategy and reward\nboth current-year performance and sustained\nlong-term value creation, and supplements\nother aspects of Capital One\u0092s pay-for-\nperformancephilosophy. By applying informed\njudgment, the Committee seeks to mitigate the\nrisks associated with a rigid and strictly\nformulaic compensation program, which could\nunintentionally create incentives for our\nexecutives to focus only on certain\nperformance metrics, encourage imprudent risk-\ntaking, and not provide the best long-term\nresults for stockholders. In addition, the use\nof judgment allows the Committee to respond to\nchanges in economic conditions, our operating\nenvironment, and other significant factors\nthat may affect the long-term performance of\nCapital One or our lines of business. The use\nof judgment also allows the Committee to\nadjust compensation based on factors that\nwould not be appropriately reflected by a\nstrictly formulaic approach, such as risk\nmanagement, championing company values, and\nthe discrepancies between absolute and\nrelative performance levels or recognition of\nindividual performance levels. There are\ncertain performance conditions for which the\nCommittee would not exercise judgment, for\nexample where the minimum performance metric\nis not met in the award of performance shares\nor if the performance-based vesting\nrequirements applicable to certain other\nstock-settled awards are not met.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  64    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \n                                     \n  Our Compensation Governance Cycle  \n                                     \nThe Committee is actively engaged throughout\nthe year and members of the Committee\nregularly meet with management regarding the\nCompany\u0092s executive compensation programs and\npractices. In addition, the Committee receives\nupdates, at least quarterly, at the Board\nlevel, regarding the Company\u0092s financial and\nstrategic performance, including information\nregarding the Company\u0092s performance against\nthe four categories of quantitative and\nqualitative performance factors related to:\nfinancial and operating performance,\ngovernance and risk management, strategic\nperformance, and winning with our customers\nand associates (the \u0093Performance Factors\u0094)\nthat are used by the Committee to determine\nthe year-endincentive awards to the NEOs. The\nCommittee met six times in 2020, with each\nmeeting concluding with an executive session\nwithout management present. In addition, the\nCommittee held two joint meetings with the\nBoard in 2020, and an additional joint meeting\nheld at the beginning of 2021 to assess\nCompany and NEO performance and determine the\nyear-endincentive awards for the NEOs.

Any year-endincentive award granted\nto the CEO (i) would continue to consist\nprimarily of a performance share award, under\nwhich he may receive 0% to 150% of a target\nnumber of shares of the Company\u0092s common stock\nbased on the Company\u0092s performance over a\nthree-year period; and (ii) may also consist\nof deferred cash, an equity-based award, or\nboth. In this manner, the CEO\u0092s compensation\nwill continue to be completely at-riskbased on\nthe Company\u0092s and Mr. Fairbank\u0092s performance,\nand all CEO compensation continues to be\nsubject to a three-year deferred vesting or\npayout. As in prior years, Mr. Fairbank did\nnot receive any cash salary in 2020. The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\ndetermined not to establish a total target\ncompensation amount for Mr. Fairbank\u0092s 2020\ncompensation program to further align Mr.\nFairbank\u0092s compensation program with that of\nthe Company\u0092s peers and increase the Committee\nand the Independent Directors\u0092 ability to\ndirectly link the CEO\u0092s compensation to the\nCompany\u0092s performance as well as the CEO\u0092s\ncontributions to that performance over the\nshort, medium, and long term.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  66    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III -

For performance year 2020,\nthe award of RSUs granted at the beginning of\n2020 and the year-endincentive accounted for\n9% and 91%, respectively, of the CEO\u0092s total\ncompensation. The year-endincentive was\ndelivered in the form of performance shares,\ndeferred cash and cash-settled RSUs,\nrepresenting 64%, 16%, and 11%, respectively,\nof the CEO\u0092s total compensation.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            67  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nRestricted Stock Units A portion of Mr.\nFairbank\u0092s 2020 compensation consisted of RSUs\ngranted as an incentive for long-term Company\nperformance. The RSU award vests in full at\nthe end of a three-year performance period\nbeginning on January 1, 2020, settles in cash\nbased on the Company\u0092s average stock price\nover the fifteen trading days preceding the\nvesting date, and is subject to performance-\nbased vesting provisions and clawback\nprovisions, each as described in more detail\nunder \u0093Additional Performance Conditions and\nRecovery Provisions\u0094 beginning on page 84.\nYear-EndIncentive Opportunity A portion of Mr.\nFairbank\u0092s 2020 compensation consisted of an\nopportunity for a year-endincentive based on\nthe Committee\u0092s evaluation of the Company\u0092s\nperformance during 2020 and Mr. Fairbank\u0092s\ncontributions to that performance. For\npurposes of the year-endincentive, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors assess\nthe Company\u0092s performance based on the\nPerformance Factors. The Committee believes\nthat these factors appropriately reflect and\nbalance near-term performance and long-term\nsuccess for the Company\u0092s customers,\nassociates, and stockholders. The Company\u0092s\n2020 performance against the Performance\nFactors is described in more detailed under\n\u00932020 Year-EndIncentive Determination\u0094\nbeginning on page 73. The year-endincentive,\nif awarded, (i) will consist of an award of\nperformance shares, and (ii) may also consist\nof deferred cash, an equity-based award, or\nboth as determined by the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors at the time the award is\ngranted. The performance share awards, the\nequity-based award and the deferred cash bonus\neach have a three-year cliff-vesting schedule\nand are subject to clawback provisions. The\nperformance-based vesting provisions\napplicable to the equity-based award and the\nclawback provisions applicable to all three\nawards are described in more detail under\n\u0093Additional Performance Conditions and\nRecovery Provisions\u0094 beginning on page 84.\nPerformance Share Awards The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors believe the performance\nshares strengthen the alignment between the\ncompensation of our NEOs and the Company\u0092s\nperformance by linking the ultimate payout to\npre-establishedabsolute and/or relative\nperformance goals, with the value of the\npayout ranging from 0% to 150%. The ultimate\nvalue of the performance shares upon vesting\nis determined by the Company\u0092s performance\nthrough its stock price. The CEO year-\nendincentive award consists primarily of\nperformance shares.

TSR is\nviewed by investors as a key indicator of the\nCompany\u0092s performance. The TSR Performance\nShares create a direct link between CEO\ncompensation and the Company\u0092s stock price and\nvalue creation over time. In addition, a\nsignificant portion of CEO pay is delivered\nthrough equity-based awards, the ultimate\nvalue of which will increase or decrease based\non the performance of the Company\u0092s stock\nprice in both current and future periods.\nPerformance Share Award Peer Group For both\nthe Financial Performance Shares and the TSR\nPerformance Shares, the Company\u0092s performance\non each metric is assessed over the three-year\nperiod relative to the Performance Share Peers\nwhich are the Company\u0092s peers in the KBW Bank\nIndex, excluding three non-traditionalbanks\nthat do not focus on lending to consumers and\nbusinesses (\u0093KBW Index\u0094). The Committee\nbelieves that the KBW Index is an appropriate\nindex against which to assess the Company\u0092s\nperformance because it reflects institutions\nof a comparable size, risk profile and\nbusiness mix to the Company. After the end of\nthe three-year performance period, the\nCommittee will certify the Company\u0092s\nperformance and issue the corresponding number\nof shares of the Company\u0092s common stock, if\nany, in accordance with the relative\nperformance hurdles illustrated below. Each of\nthe metrics will be calculated as indicated\nabove, with the Committee excluding from such\ncalculations the initial effects of changes in\ntax laws, accounting principles or\nregulations, or other laws or provisions\naffecting the reported results if the\nCommittee determines that such adjustments are\nappropriate in order to prevent dilution or\nenlargement of the benefits or potential\nbenefits intended to be made available under\nthe 2004 Stock Incentive Plan as necessary or\nappropriate to comply with applicable laws,\nrules or regulations. Performance Share Award\nFormula For all performance share awards, the\nultimate number of performance shares earned\nat vesting is determined by a formula based on\nrelative performance and/or absolute\nperformance (in the form of a performance\nshare\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  70    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nreduction) measures, with the value of the\npayout ranging from 0% to 150%. In addition,\nthe value of the performance shares upon\nvesting is determined by the Company\u0092s stock\nprice performance. All performance share\nawards are subject to the Relative Performance\nMeasure (as described below). Only the\nFinancial Performance Shares are subject to\nthe Absolute Performance Measure (as described\nbelow). The award agreements applicable to all\nperformance share awards permit the Committee\nto exclude the initial effects of changes in\ntax laws, accounting principles or\nregulations, or other laws or provisions\naffecting the reported results if the\nCommittee determines that such adjustments are\nappropriate in order to prevent dilution or\nenlargement of the benefits or potential\nbenefits intended to be made available under\nthe 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or necessary or\nappropriate to comply with applicable laws,\nrules or regulations. Relative Performance\nMeasure. Each year, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors assess the Company\u0092s\nperformance on the basis of the performance\nshare award metrics relative to the\nPerformance Share Peers. The Company\u0092s TSR or\npositive Adjusted ROTCE and D+TBV, as\napplicable, must be at least at the 25th\npercentile of the Performance Share Peers for\nany performance shares to vest; target payout\nwill be achieved at the 55th percentile of the\nPerformance Share Peers; and the maximum\npayout can only be achieved if the Company\nperforms at the 80th percentile of the\nPerformance Share Peers. If the Company\u0092s TSR\nor Adjusted ROTCE and D+TBV, as applicable, is\nunder the 25th percentile, none of the shares\nwill vest and no payout will be made with\nrespect to the award. After the end of the\nthree-year performance period, the Committee\nwill certify the Company\u0092s performance and\nissue the corresponding number of shares of\nthe Company\u0092s common stock, if any, in\naccordance with the graph below. Payouts will\nrange between the values shown below for\nperformance that falls between the points\nlabeled in the graph. Absolute Performance\nMeasure (Performance Share Reduction) -\nFinancial Performance Shares. The Financial\nPerformance Shares are subject to a\nperformance share reduction. Under the\nperformance share reduction feature, the\nnumber of shares issued at settlement will be\nreduced if the Company\u0092s Adjusted ROTCE for\none or more fiscal years completed during the\nperformance period is not positive, no matter\nhow well the Company performs compared to the\nPerformance Share Peers. In each year that the\nCompany does not achieve positive Adjusted\nROTCE, the executive will forfeit 50% of that\nyear\u0092s worth of performance shares. If the\nCompany\u0092s Adjusted ROTCE is not positive in\neach of the three fiscal years in the\nperformance period, the executive will forfeit\nthe entire award of performance shares. See\n\u0093Performance Share Reduction\u0094 on page 86 and\n\u0093Financial Restatement Clawbacks\u0094 on page 86\nfor more information.

For the 2018, 2019 and 2020 performance\nyears, the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors have awarded RSUs to Mr. Fairbank.\nThe vesting of the RSUs is deferred for three\nyears and settlement is in cash based on the\nCompany\u0092s average stock price over the fifteen\ntrading days preceding the vesting date. The\nRSUs are subject to performance-based vesting\nand clawback provisions, each as described in\nmore detail under \u0093Additional Performance\nConditions and Recovery Provisions\u0094 beginning\non page 84. Deferred Cash Bonus A portion of\nthe CEO year-endincentive may be granted in\nthe form of a deferred cash bonus based on the\nCompany and CEO performance for the preceding\nperformance year. Any deferred cash bonus\naward is mandatorily deferred for three years\ninto the Company\u0092s VNQDCP. 2020 CEO\nCompensation Decisions For the 2020\nperformance year, the Committee and\nIndependent Directors determined the amount\nand form of the CEO\u0092s compensation using a\nbalanced approach in the context of our\ncompensation principles and objectives, which\nencompass a pay-for-performancephilosophy. The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\nbelieve that this pay-for-\nperformancestructure, which emphasizes\nvariable pay, incentivizes the CEO to invest\nfor the long-term, grow resiliently, manage\nrisk, and deliver sustained stockholder value.\nIn addition, the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors believe this approach is in the best\ninterests of the stockholders and provides the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors a\ngreater opportunity to determine the amount\nand form of compensation based on CEO and\nCompany performance and stockholder feedback\nas well as being able to respond to then-\ncurrent business conditions, the dynamic\nnature of executive compensation practices,\nand developments in our business and industry.\nFor 2020 in particular, this structure allowed\nthe Committee and Independent Directors to\nrespond to the unique circumstances of the\nyear and incorporate stockholder feedback\nreceived during the year that led to an award\nof a portion of the CEO\u0092s year-endincentive in\nthe form of performance shares that vest\nentirely based on the Company\u0092s TSR. 2020\nRestricted Stock Unit Award In January 2020,\nthe Committee and the Independent Directors\nawarded Mr. Fairbank 17,129 RSUs, which had a\ntotal grant date value of approximately $1.75\nmillion.

The remaining total\ncompensation to be awarded to Mr. Fairbank for\nthe 2020 performance year was awarded in the\nform of the year-endincentive award totaling\n$17.0 million. 2020 Year-EndIncentive Awards\nAfter considering the Company\u0092s compensation\nphilosophy and objectives, including the\ndesire to align Mr. Fairbank\u0092s interests with\nthat of the Company\u0092s stockholders and reward\nperformance over multiple horizons, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\ndetermined that the pay mix for the year-\nendincentive award would include the following\nthree vehicles:\n                                              \n       Performance Shares. 71% of the         \n       year-end                               \n       incentive (64% of Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u0092s total  \n       2020 performance year compensation)    \n       was awarded in the form of             \n       performance shares, with a total       \n       grant date value of approximately      \n       $12.0\u00a0million, under which Mr.\u00a0        \n       Fairbank may receive from 0%           \n  \u220e    to 150% of a target number of 106,516  \n       shares of the Company\u0092s common stock    \n       based on the Company\u0092s performance      \n       over a three-year period from January  \n       1, 2021 through December\u00a031, 2023.     \n       Over the preceding five years,         \n       including 2020,                        \n       Mr.\u00a0Fairbank\u0092s performance share        \n       awards have ranged from $8.75 to       \n       $13.0\u00a0million.                         \n                                              \n                                              \n       Financial Performance Shares. $9.0\u00a0    \n       million of the awarded performance     \n       shares will vest based on the          \n       Company\u0092s financial performance, on an  \n       absolute basis and relative to the     \n       Performance Share Peers, related to a  \n  \u220e    combination of two metrics: Common     \n       Dividends plus Growth of Tangible      \n       Book Value per share and Adjusted      \n       ROTCE over a three-year period in the  \n       form of Financial Performance Shares   \n       as described in \u0093Performance Share      \n       Award Formula\u0094 beginning on page 70.    \n                                              \n                                              \n       TSR Performance Shares. $3.0\u00a0million   \n       of the awarded performance             \n       shares will vest based on the          \n       Company\u0092s TSR relative to the           \n  \u220e    Performance Share Peers over a         \n       three-year period in the form of TSR   \n       Performance Shares as described in     \n       \u0093Performance Share Award Formula\u0094        \n       beginning on page 70.                  \n                                              \nIn order for the CEO to realize the target\nvalue of this award, the Company must achieve\nabove-median financial performance and TSR on\na relative basis versus the Performance Share\nPeers.

The non-GAAP measures  \n       consist of our adjusted results that   \n       our Committee believes are indicative  \n       of the Company\u0092s performance and help   \n       investors and                          \n  (2)  users of our financial information     \n       understand the effect of adjusting     \n       items on our selected reported         \n       results and provide alternate          \n       measurements of our performance.

                               \nCEO Contribution to Company Performance In\ndetermining the CEO\u0092s 2020 year-endincentive\nawards, the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors also assessed Mr. Fairbank\u0092s\ncontributions to the Company\u0092s 2020\nperformance. Under Mr. Fairbank\u0092s leadership,\nCapital One navigated through an unprecedented\nyear of change and uncertainty while\ndelivering solid financial and operating\nperformance and continued resilience, and\nresponded to the needs of customers,\nassociates and communities during the\nCOVID-19pandemic and resulting economic\ndownturn. In addition, Mr. Fairbank guided the\nCompany through difficult near-term operating\ndecisions while continuing to drive and\nsupport long-term strategic priorities and\ninvestments. Those include attracting and\ndeveloping top talent, investing in technology\nand digital capabilities, growing Capital\nOne\u0092s major business franchises, strengthening\nthe risk and control environment, prudently\nmanaging costs, and continuing to make\nnecessary and disciplined investments to\nposition the Company to deliver sustainable\nfinancial performance and long-term growth and\nvalue to stockholders. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors believe that the\nCompany\u0092s financial results reflect the\nunprecedented events of 2020 and the\nappropriate choices made by Mr. Fairbank and\nthe senior executive leadership of the Company\nto increase resilience, conservatively manage\ncapital and liquidity, and to reduce risk.\nThey acknowledged, however, that the Company\u0092s\nearnings for the year decreased significantly\ncompared to 2019 as a result of an increase to\nthe allowance for future potential credit\nlosses. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors also recognized that Mr. Fairbank\u0092s\nvisionary leadership and oversight of the\ntransformational investments in technology,\ntalent, infrastructure, and capabilities drove\nthe Company\u0092s swift and effective response to\nthe pandemic and positioned the Company for\nthe opportunities that lie ahead. In addition,\nMr. Fairbank continued to model and reinforce\nthe Company\u0092s culture and values with key\nstakeholders and led the Company\u0092s pandemic\nresponse and social justice initiatives with\nassociates, partners, suppliers, investors and\nthe community. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors also took into account\nMr. Fairbank\u0092s unique role as the founder of\nCapital One, as well as peer comparator group\nCEO compensation levels and structure,\nincluding the tenures of each of the peer\ncompanies\u0092 CEOs and the varying degrees of\nsuccess those CEOs have had in leading their\nrespective companies in 2020 and over time.\nThe Committee and the Independent Directors\nalso recognized that Mr. Fairbank does not\nreceive a cash salary, and 100% of his\ncompensation is deferred for at least three\nyears. The Committee believes that the actions\ntaken by Mr. Fairbank and the other NEOs\nthroughout 2020, including their swift and\ndecisive response to the COVID-19pandemic,\ndrove the Company\u0092s solid results and advanced\nthe Company\u0092s long-term strategy.

This table differs\nsubstantially from the Summary Compensation\nTable beginning on page 92 and is therefore\nnot a substitute for the information required\nin that table. There are two principal\ndifferences between the Summary Compensation\nTable and the table above:\n                                              \n       The table above reports equity-based   \n       awards as compensation for the         \n       performance year for which they were   \n       awarded, even                          \n       if the award was granted in one year   \n       based on performance for the prior     \n       year. The Summary Compensation Table   \n       reports equity-based awards in the     \n  \u220e    year in which they were granted. As a  \n       result, the performance share awards   \n       and cash-settled RSUs granted          \n       to Mr.\u00a0Fairbank in January 2020 for    \n       the 2019 performance year, for         \n       example, are shown in the table above  \n       as 2019 compensation but will be       \n       shown in the Summary Compensation      \n       Table as 2020 compensation.            \n                                              \n                                              \n       The Summary Compensation Table         \n       reports the change in pension value    \n       and                                    \n       non-qualified deferred compensation    \n  \u220e    earnings and all other compensation.   \n       These amounts generally are not a      \n       result of current-year compensation    \n       determinations and are not shown       \n       above.                                 \n                                              \nSettlement of Performance Shares Granted in\nFebruary 2018 In February 2018, the Committee\nand the Independent Directors granted the NEOs\nFinancial Performance Shares under which the\nNEOs could receive in 2021 between 0% to 150%\nof a target number of shares of the Company\u0092s\ncommon stock based on the Company\u0092s financial\nperformance between January 1, 2018 and\nDecember 31, 2020 (the \u00932018 Financial\nPerformance Shares\u0094). Each year, the Committee\nand the Independent Directors assess the\nCompany\u0092s relative performance based on the\napplicable performance share award metrics\nrelative to the Performance Share Peers over\nthe three-year performance period, and where\nappropriate, apply a performance share\nreduction based on the Company\u0092s absolute\nperformance. See \u0093Performance Share Award\nFormula\u0094 beginning on page 70 for a\ndescription of the performance share award\nformula applicable to the 2018 Financial\nPerformance Shares. Effective as of January 1,\n2020, the Company adopted the Current Expected\nCredit Loss (\u0093CECL\u0094) standard, a new\naccounting requirement by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board that changed the\nrecognition and measurement of credit losses\nfor loans and debt securities. This adoption\nimpacted the Company\u0092s reported level of\nallowance for credit losses and shareholder\u0092s\nequity, as described in the Company\u0092s\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Qfiled with the\nSEC on May 1, 2020 (the \u0093CECL Impact\u0094).\nSpecifically, the Company and the Performance\nShare Peers recognized a one-timeincrease or\ndecrease in the allowance for credit losses\nand a corresponding reduction or increase in\nshareholder\u0092s equity as of January 1, 2020\nbased upon the specific facts and\ncircumstances of each institution. The CECL\nImpact applies to the 2018 Financial\nPerformance Shares as well the Financial\nPerformance Shares granted in 2019 and 2020\nfor which the the 2020 performance year is\nincluded in the applicable performance period\n(collectively, the \u0093CECL Impacted Performance\nShares\u0094). After considering that: (i) the\nperformance share awards granted to the NEOs\nare designed to reward Company performance\nover a three-year period of time; (ii) the\nCECL Impact was not anticipated at the time\nthe awards were made and did not reflect the\nCompany\u0092s underlying business performance in\n2020, and; the award agreements applicable to\nthe CECL Impacted Financial Performance Shares\nexplicitly contemplate and permit the\nexclusion of the initial effects of changes in\naccounting principles (as described under\n\u0093Performance Share Award Peer Group\u0094 on page\n70); the Committee determined it appropriate\nto evaluate Tangible Book Value (as defined on\npage 69 under \u0093Performance Share Award\nMetrics\u0094) performance for the Company and the\nPerformance Share Peers in fiscal year 2020,\nfor purposes of the settlement of the CECL\nImpacted Performance Shares, in a manner that\nexcludes, on a one-timebasis, the CECL Impact.\nSee \u00932020 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal\nYear-End\u0094 table on page 97 for disclosure\nregarding the outstanding performance share\nawards. The Compensation Committee and the\nIndependent Directors did not make any\nadjustments to the Company\u0092s performance\nassociated with the performance shares or\nother compensation to reflect the impacts to\nthe Company\u0092s financial performance as a\nresult of the economic downturn and other\neffects of the COVID-19pandemic.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            77  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nBased on the Committee and Independent\nDirectors\u0092 assessment of the Company\u0092s\nrelative and absolute performance over the\nthree-year performance period, the 2018\nFinancial Performance Shares settled at\n116.67% of their target value. Two-thirdsof\neach Financial Performance Share award vested\nbased on D+TBV, and one-thirdof each\nperformance share award vested based on\nAdjusted ROTCE. The Company performed at the\n90th percentile relative to the KBW Index with\nrespect to D+TBV and at the 50th percentile\nrelative to the KBW Index with respect to\nAdjusted ROTCE. The Company achieved positive\nAdjusted ROTCE for each of the three years of\nthe performance such that the 2018 Financial\nPerformance Shares settled without a\nperformance share reduction. See \u0093Absolute\nPerformance Measure (Performance Share\nReduction) \u0097 Financial Performance Shares\u0094\nbeginning on page 71 for more information\nregarding the performance share reduction\nfeature applicable to the 2018 Financial\nPerformance Shares. Additional Pay Elements As\npart of the CEO compensation program, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors also\napproved certain other programs intended to\nsupport Mr. Fairbank\u0092s productivity, well-\nbeing and security. These programs provide\nsome level of personal benefit and are not\ngenerally available to all associates.

The Committee\nand the Independent Directors will use their\njudgment to determine whether to make the\nyear-endincentive award, the form of the award\nand the value of the award.

The Committee takes into\naccount each NEO\u0092s historical performance,\nindividual roles and responsibilities, and\ncontributions expected from each NEO in the\nfuture as well as the recommendations of the\nCEO, including his assessment of each NEO\u0092s\nperformance. In January 2020, the Committee\nand the Independent Directors approved the\n2020 compensation program, which is designed\nto be consistent with the Company\u0092s pay-for-\nperformancephilosophy. Based on market\npractices and trends, a review of peer\ncomparator information and in response to\nstockholder feedback, beginning with the 2018\nperformance year, NEO total target\ncompensation is composed of 20% base salary,\n25% cash incentive opportunity, and 55% long-\nterm incentive opportunity, which will consist\nof performance shares and stock-settled RSUs\nas determined by the Committee. The Committee\nbelieves that this pay mix balances\nstockholder interests while effectively\nrewarding and motivating key talent. For the\n2020 performance year, the NEOs received a mix\nof approximately 45% cash and 55% equity-based\ncompensation as follows: cash salary,\ndetermined at the beginning of the performance\nyear; and a cash incentive and long-term\nincentive awards, determined following the end\nof the performance year based on the\nCommittee\u0092s evaluation of Company and\nindividual performance during the past year.\nThe long-term incentive awards granted for the\n2020 performance year consisted of performance\nshares (approximately 30% of total target\ncompensation) and stock-settled RSUs\n(generally 25% of total target compensation).\nAll of the equity awards vest over a three-\nyear period.

and a year-endincentive opportunity that,\nif granted, may consist of equity awards in\nthe form of performance shares and/or RSUs,\nand a cash incentive. The chart below shows\nthe 2020 components of NEO compensation as an\napproximate percentage of NEO total target\ncompensation: Base Salaries Beginning with the\n2018 performance year, the Committee decreased\nthe percentage of total target compensation\npaid to the NEOs in the form of a base salary\nfrom 35% to 20% and chose to defer a larger\nportion of each NEO\u0092s compensation until the\nend of the year. In January 2020, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\napproved 2020 cash base salaries for the NEOs\nranging from $1.12 million to $1.14 million.\nIndividual details for each NEO are provided\nin the table below showing compensation by\nperformance year. Year-EndIncentive Awards A\nportion of the NEOs\u0092 2020 compensation\nconsisted of an opportunity for a year-\nendincentive award based on Company and the\nNEO\u0092s individual performance in 2020. This\naward, if granted, may consist of long-term\nincentive awards in the form of performance\nshares and/or RSUs, and a cash incentive\naward. In February 2021, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors determined to award each\nNEO performance shares, a cash incentive award\nand RSUs as recognition of Company and NEO\nindividual performance in 2020. Cash Incentive\nAwards The cash incentive awards provided to\nthe NEOs are based on the Committee\u0092s\nevaluation of the Company\u0092s performance during\n2020. In January 2020, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors established a target\nvalue for the cash incentive for each NEO\nconsisting of approximately 25% of the NEOs\u0092\ntotal target compensation. The Committee and\nthe Independent Directors may determine to\naward 0% to 150% of the cash incentive target\nvalue based on Company performance. For\npurposes of the cash incentive awards, the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors assess\nthe Company\u0092s performance based on the\nPerformance Factors. The Committee believes\nthat these factors appropriately reflect and\nbalance near-term performance and long-term\nsuccess for the Company\u0092s customers,\nassociates, and stockholders. See \u00932020 CEO\nCompensation Program\u0094 beginning on page 65 for\ndetails regarding the Performance Factors. In\nFebruary 2021, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors approved cash incentive\nawards for the NEOs ranging from $1.35 million\nto $1.38 million, representing a payout at\n100% of the target award values established by\nthe Committee in January 2020 based on actual\nCompany performance in 2020. Individual\ndetails for each NEO are provided in the table\nbelow showing compensation by performance\nyear. The assessment of Company performance\nfor the NEOs is consistent with the assessment\nperformed in connection with the CEO year-\nendincentive award. The Committee and the\nIndependent Directors determined that these\nawards were appropriate in light of the\nCompany\u0092s performance as described under\n\u0093Year-EndIncentive Opportunity\u0094 beginning on\npage 68 in connection with the determinations\nby the Committee and the Independent Directors\nrelating to the CEO\u0092s year-endincentive\nawards.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            81  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nLong-Term Incentive Awards Long-term incentive\nawards are designed to reward individual\nperformance and align a significant portion of\ncompensation with achievement of both annual\nand long-term performance goals. In\ndetermining the actual amounts to be awarded\nto each NEO, the Committee considered each\nNEO\u0092s contribution to the Company\u0092s\nperformance for 2020, as well as the\nindividual performance of each NEO. The\nCommittee also received input from the CEO on\nhis assessment of each NEO\u0092s individual\nperformance and his recommendations for\ncompensation of the NEOs. The CEO also\nassessed the degree to which the NEO balanced\nrisks inherent in the NEO\u0092s role. These\nassessments included the use of both\nquantitative and qualitative risk measures and\nwere compiled by the Chief Risk Officer and\nreviewed by the Chief Human Resources Officer,\nand separately the Chief Audit Officer\ncompiled and reviewed the assessment for the\nChief Risk Officer, before such assessments\nwere presented to the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors for their consideration.\nIn February 2021, the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors granted long-term\nincentive awards, consisting of stock-settled\nRSUs and performance shares, to the NEOs as\nrecognition for individual NEO performance in\n2020 and to drive further long-term\nperformance. The Long-term incentive awards\ngranted to the NEOs for performance year 2020\nranged from $3.0 million to $3.3 million.\nLong-term incentive awards are linked to\nperformance in two ways:\n                                              \n       The size of the award is based on      \n  \u220e    each NEO\u0092s individual performance       \n       assessment for the year just           \n       completed                              \n                                              \n                                              \n       The ultimate value of the award is     \n  \u220e    dependent on Capital One\u0092s performance  \n       over time                              \n                                              \nThe terms of the performance share awards are\nsubstantially similar to the terms of the\nFinancial Performance Shares awarded to our\nCEO for performance year 2020, as described\nearlier under \u0093Performance Share Award\nMetrics\u0094 beginning on page 69. The NEOs do not\nreceive TSR Performance Shares. The NEO stock-\nsettled RSUs vest ratably in one-\nthirdincrements starting on the first\nanniversary of the grant date and are subject\nto performance-based vesting and clawback\nprovisions as discussed below under\n\u0093Additional Performance Conditions and\nRecovery Provisions\u0094 beginning on page 84.\n2020 NEO Year-EndIncentive Compensation\nDecisions Scott Blackley - Chief Financial\nOfficer Mr. Blackley was awarded a cash\nincentive of $1,353,000, 11,996 stock-settled\nRSUs, and a target amount of 14,395\nperformance shares with a total grant date\nfair value for both awards of $2,973,210. The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\ndetermined to grant these awards based upon\nMr. Blackley\u0092s leadership of the Company\u0092s\nfinance organization, his well-managed efforts\nin capital planning and financial forecasting,\nincluding an additional unplanned CCAR cycle\nand the implementation of CECL, as well as his\nability to balance near-term financial results\nwith the Company\u0092s strategic growth agenda. In\n2020, Mr. Blackley continued to leverage\ntechnology and digital tools to drive\nsignificant improvements in the Company\u0092s\nfinancial reporting, and the management of\ndisclosure and related controls. The Committee\nand the Independent Directors also considered\nMr. Blackley\u0092s collaborative partnership, deep\nfinancial acumen and market orientation,\nefforts in prioritizing and cultivating talent\nin the finance organization, and recognized\nhis sound judgment, as well as his thoughtful\nand integrative advice to senior management to\nadvance the Company\u0092s financial performance,\noperational execution and strategic investment\ndecisions.

The program consists of\nmultiple compensation vehicles that directly\nlink the NEOs\u0092 compensation with the Company\u0092s\nperformance over multiple time horizons, align\nthe NEOs\u0092 interests with the interests of the\nCompany\u0092s stockholders, support safety and\nsoundness, and encourage appropriate risk-\ntaking.

In addition, the Committee\nnevertheless determined that these awards\nshould be subject to additional performance\nconditions so that the value received by the\nexecutives is also conditioned upon the\nCompany continuing to meet certain operating\nperformance thresholds for each and every\nfiscal year ending in the three-year vesting\nperiod. Any forfeitures will be cumulative\nover the three-year vesting period. In this\nmanner, regardless of our executives\u0092 past\nperformance and our stock price performance,\nthe awards subject to performance-based\nvesting remain at risk of complete forfeiture\nover the three-year vesting period.\nPerformance-based vesting provisions apply to\nthe following awards:\n                                    \n  \u220e    All NEO stock option awards  \n                                    \n                                   \n  \u220e    All NEO stock-settled RSUs  \n                                   \n                                  \n  \u220e    All CEO cash-settled RSUs  \n                                  \nThese performance conditions do not present\nany upside potential for the NEOs\u0092\ncompensation but instead create an additional\nat-riskelement to the compensation that has\nbeen awarded to them. Imposing these\nadditional performance conditions is designed\nto further reflect our approach of balancing\nrisk and performance over the long term. For\nawards granted since January 2014, vesting is\nconditioned on the Company achieving positive\nCore Earnings (as defined below). If Core\nEarnings are not positive for any fiscal year\nin the vesting period, the named executive\nofficer will automatically forfeit 50% of one\nyear\u0092s worth of vesting (i.e., one-sixthof the\ntotal award). In addition, the Committee will\ndetermine the extent to which any named\nexecutive officer was accountable for the\noutcome and, based on such determination, the\nCommittee will decide whether any or all of\nthe remaining 50% of one year\u0092s worth of\nvesting will also be forfeited. The Committee\nmay also decide to delay the vesting of the\napplicable portion of the award not so\nforfeited. For the NEOs, these determinations\nwill be made each year prior to the scheduled\nvesting date, based on the Core Earnings for\nthe fiscal year ended prior to such vesting\ndate. For the CEO, these determinations will\nbe made prior to the scheduled vesting date at\nthe end of the three-year vesting period,\ntaking into account Core Earnings for each\nfiscal year within the period. Core Earnings\nfocuses on whether profits are being generated\nby our basic business, as opposed to other\nfactors that may not reflect business\nfundamentals. The terms of the applicable\naward agreements define \u0093Core Earnings\u0094 to\nmean the Company\u0092s net income available to\ncommon stockholders, excluding, on a tax-\nadjustedbasis, the impact of (i) impairment or\namortization of intangible assets, (ii) the\nbuild or release of the allowance for loan and\nlease losses, calculated as the difference\nbetween the provision for loan and lease\nlosses and charge-offs, net of recoveries, and\n(iii) the change in the combined uncollectible\nfinance charge and fee reserve. The Committee\nbelieves that Core Earnings is an appropriate\nperformance metric to employ for these\nperformance-based vesting provisions because\nthe metric captures major operational costs\nand risks to the Company\u0092s business, including\ncharge-offs, operating expenses, market and\ncompetitive risks and costs to maintain\nadequate levels of capital and liquidity.\nBecause the metric is based on net income\navailable to common stockholders, it also\nincludes the impact of discontinued\noperations.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            85  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nPerformance Share Reduction\n                                              \n                     Each performance share   \n                     award granted to the     \n                     NEOs provides that the   \n                     total value delivered    \n                     at vesting will be       \n                     reduced if for any year  \n                     in the three-year        \n                     performance period the   \n                     Company does not         \n                     achieve positive         \n  Performance        Adjusted ROTCE.

FW Cook assists the Committee in a\nnumber of ways, including proposing and\nevaluating a peer comparator group, gathering\nrelevant compensation data from the peer\ngroup, and discussing relevant market trends\nand context and developing recommendations on\npossible plan designs. See the discussion\nunder \u0093Compensation Committee Consultant\u0094\nbeginning on page 41 for additional\ninformation about FW Cook. The Chief Human\nResources Officer and other members of the\nCompany\u0092s Human Resources department assist\nthe CEO in developing compensation\nrecommendations for the NEOs other than the\nCEO for the Committee\u0092s consideration. The\nHuman Resources department typically uses\nmultiple surveys as sources of market\ncompensation data. FW Cook also provides\nadditional market reference points that the\nCommittee and the Independent Directors use\nwhen evaluating NEO compensation, and other\noutside consultants provide information to the\nHuman Resources department regarding market\npractices, trends and research reports. The\nHuman Resources department is responsible for\nanalyzing the information obtained from the\noutside consultants and presenting it to the\nCEO, who considers the information and makes\nhis compensation recommendations for the NEOs\nto the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors. A consultant from FW Cook is\npresent at Committee meetings during which CEO\nand NEO compensation is discussed and provides\nmarket data as well as an independent\nperspective regarding CEO and NEO compensation\npractices. FW Cook has no other engagement\nwith, and performs no other services for,\nCapital One other than the services described\nabove.

Peer\nGroups Peer Group to Determine Level and\nComponents of Compensation In order to\nattract, retain and motivate top executive\ntalent and non-employeedirectors consistent\nwith our compensation program objectives, the\nCommittee reviews data annually from a group\nof peer companies that are similar in size,\nbusiness, and industry as the Company. These\norganizations are intended to represent the\nmarketplace of companies with which Capital\nOne competes for business and for executive\ntalent. The compensation data from the peer\ngroup is used to inform the Committee\u0092s\ndetermination of the structure and the total\ncompensation target values of the compensation\nprogram for the NEOs other than the CEO and\nthe total level of compensation for the CEO.\nThe peer group is reviewed each year and\nadjusted, as appropriate, so that the peer\ngroup companies reflect Capital One\u0092s\ncompetitive environment. The Committee\nexamines pay practices and data for the peer\ngroup companies as a source of benchmarking\ndata to assess the competitiveness of our\ncompensation levels and pay components. As\npart of this analysis, a consultant from FW\nCook presents a comprehensive report to the\nCommittee that highlights the size, scope and\nperformance information from the peer\ncompanies across a variety of metrics and\npresents recommendations for changes to the\npeer group, as applicable. The Committee\nspecifically considers the Company\u0092s\npercentile rank versus peer comparator\ncompanies across the following financial\nmetrics:\n                                              \n  \u220e\u2002Revenue                                   \n  \u220e\u2002Assets              \u220e\u2002Adjusted ROA        \n  \u220e\u2002Market value        \u220e\u2002Tier 1 common       \n  \u220e\u2002Net income          capital ratio         \n  available to          \u220e\u2002Charge-off rate     \n  common                \u220e\u2002Ratio of stock      \n  stockholders          price to tangible     \n  \u220e\u2002U.S. deposits       book value            \n  \u220e\u2002Loans held for      \u220e\u2002Ratio of stock      \n  investment            price to earnings \u00a0   \n  \u220e\u2002Diluted EPS         \u220e\u2002TSR                 \n  growth                                      \n                                              \n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            87  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nAfter reviewing this information, the\nCommittee recommends a final peer comparator\ngroup to the Independent Directors for\napproval. In 2020, the peer group was expanded\nto add seven companies to the peer group\nutilized for 2020. The Committee and\nIndependent directors determined to expand the\npeer group to add diversified financial\ninstitutions and payment companies to (i)\nmitigate market data volatility due to the\ncurrent small sample size, (ii) recognize the\nCompany\u0092s focus on technological innovations\nin the banking industry, and (iii) position\nthe Company near the median with regard to the\nsize of the companies in the group. The peer\ngroup approved in 2020 includes the following\ncompanies:\n                                              \n  \u220e\u2002Ally         \u220e\u2002Goldman      \u220e\u2002Regions     \n  Financial*     Sachs          Financial     \n                 Group*                       \n  \u220e\u2002American     \u220e\u2002J.P.         \u220e\u2002Synchrony   \n  Express        Morgan         Financial*    \n                 Chase                        \n  \u220e\u2002Bank of      \u220e\u2002             \u220e\u2002Truist      \n  America        Mastercard*    Financial     \n  Corporation                                 \n  \u220e\u2002Citigroup    \u220e\u2002Morgan       \u220e\u2002U.S.        \n                 Stanley*       Bancorp       \n  \u220e\u2002Discover                                  \n  Financial      \u220e\u2002PayPal*      \u220e\u2002Visa*       \n  Services                                    \n  \u220e\u2002Fifth        \u220e\u2002PNC          \u220e\u2002Wells       \n  Third          Financial      Fargo\u00a0&       \n  Bancorp        Services       Company       \n                                              \n* Indicates a company added to the peer group\nin 2020. The Committee and the Independent\nDirectors believe that this peer group\nreflects the competitive environment for the\nCompany, particularly the performance and\nbusiness focus of the companies in the peer\ngroup and the competition for executive\ntalent. As of December 31, 2020, Capital One\nwas positioned at or near the median of the\npeer comparator group in terms of total\nassets, loans, deposits, revenues, net income,\nand market value. Peer Group to Determine\nSettlement of Performance Share Awards For\nboth the Financial Performance Shares and the\nTSR Performance Shares, the Company\u0092s\nperformance on each metric is assessed over\nthe three-year period relative to the\nPerformance Share Peers. See \u0093Performance\nShare Award Peer Group\u0094 on page 70 for\nadditional information. Tally Sheets In\naddition to considering market data from our\npeer comparator group (when available), the\nCommittee also conducts an annual\ncomprehensive review of tally sheets for the\nCEO and each NEO which reflect all components\nof compensation and include total compensation\nand potential payouts. Each tally sheet\nsummarizes multiple components of current and\nhistorical compensation, as well as the\npotential value of post-termination\narrangements. The tally sheets assist with the\nCommittee\u0092s understanding of the historical\ncontext that is relevant to current\ncompensation decisions, such as the CEO and\neach NEO\u0092s unrealized equity value. The tally\nsheets also help the Committee assess the\npotential downstream consequences of its\ndecisions, such as the potential value to be\nreceived by the CEO and each NEO upon\nseparation due to a change of control,\nretirement or other termination scenarios.\n                                   \n  Other Compensation Arrangements  \n                                   \nPension and Non-QualifiedDeferred Compensation\nPlans Capital One does not have any active\npension plans for the NEOs. In 2020, each of\nour NEOs participated in Capital One\u0092s VNQDCP,\nwhich is a voluntary, non-qualifieddeferred\ncompensation plan that restores participating\nNEOs, excluding the CEO, to the level of\nsavings they would have achieved if they had\nnot been impacted by IRS limits governing our\nqualified 401(k) plan. It also allows the\nNEOs, excluding the CEO, to defer additional\npre-taxcompensation in order to save for\nretirement. The CEO participates in the VNQDCP\non a non-voluntarybasis, as the deferred cash\nportion of his year-endincentive is\nmandatorily deferred in the VNQDCP for three\nyears. Capital One periodically reviews\npension and other deferred compensation\nprograms and practices at our peer comparator\ncompanies and across the financial services\nindustry. We also review changes in the legal\nand regulatory environment pertaining to\nretirement programs.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  88    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nDetails of the VNQDCP can be found under\n\u0093Capital One\u0092s Voluntary Non-QualifiedDeferred\nCompensation Programs\u0094 on page 99. Employment\nAgreements Capital One typically does not\nenter into defined term employment agreements\nwith the NEOs in order to maintain maximum\nflexibility in establishing separation terms\nat the appropriate time and considering their\ncurrent circumstances. The Committee retains\nfull discretion to approve employment\nagreements on an exception basis and has done\nso for exceptional circumstances in the past.\nNone of the current NEOs have an employment\nagreement. Change of Control Agreements Each\nNEO is a party to an agreement providing\ncertain benefits if the executive\u0092s employment\nterminates in connection with a change of\ncontrol, as well as compensation and benefits\nprotections during the two-yearperiod\nfollowing the change of control. The change of\ncontrol agreements define compensation and\nbenefits payable to NEOs in certain merger and\nacquisition scenarios. The Committee believes\nthese agreements provide the NEOs with some\ncertainty and allow the NEOs to remain neutral\nand consider a full range of strategic\ndecisions that are focused on maximizing\nstockholder value. The change of control\nagreements are also intended to allow Capital\nOne\u0092s businesses to operate with minimal\ndisruption in the event of a change of control\nby providing each NEO with an incentive to\nremain in his or her leadership role up to and\nbeyond the transaction date. In addition to\ncompensation and benefits protections during a\ntwo-yearprotection period after a change of\ncontrol, the NEOs are entitled to severance\nbenefits under the agreements if their\nemployment is actually terminated as a result\nof (or in anticipation of) certain merger and\nacquisition scenarios. Both eligibility for\nparticipation and the structure of payments\nunder these agreements are designed to be\naligned with market practice in the banking\nand financial services industry. Our program\nis designed so that our stockholders are not\nfaced with disproportionate severance costs\nthat may impair potential merger\nopportunities. In addition, our change of\ncontrol agreements for executive officers do\nnot provide for excise tax \u0093gross-up\u0094payments.\nProjections of potential payouts to the NEOs\nunder these agreements are included in the\ntotal compensation tally sheets reviewed by\nthe Committee on an annual basis. Although the\npotential change of control payouts do not\nnecessarily impact annual decisions on NEO\npay, reviewing this information allows the\nCommittee to fully understand the downstream\nimplications of its decisions and the\nresulting impact to the Company and its\nstockholders.

Post-Employment Compensation\nPractices The CEO has no employment or\nseverance arrangement with the Company other\nthan the change of control agreement as\ndescribed above. If an NEO, excluding the CEO,\nseparates from Capital One, he or she is\nentitled to receive the amounts set forth in\nthe Company\u0092s Executive Severance Plan, which\nprovides for a payment of up to 30% of the\nNEO\u0092s then-current total target compensation\nplus a pro-ratedseverance bonus based on the\nNEO\u0092s target cash incentive in the event of\ninvoluntary termination without cause due to\nrestructuring. Additional benefits include\npartially subsidized health, dental and vision\nbenefits for a period of up to 18 months\nthrough COBRA, and term life continuation and\noutplacement services for a period of up to\none year following separation. The Committee\nmay exercise its discretion in approving\nadditional amounts in light of all relevant\ncircumstances, including the NEO\u0092s term of\nemployment, past accomplishments, reasons for\nseparation from the Company, potential risks\nand the NEO\u0092s willingness to restrict his or\nher future action(s), such as through an\nagreement not to compete or solicit the\nCompany\u0092s customers or associates. In\naddition, following a separation from Capital\nOne, certain equity-based awards will continue\nto vest according to their original terms, as\ndescribed under \u0093Payments Under Certain\nTermination Scenarios\u0094 beginning on page 102.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            89  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nCapital One has entered into agreements with\ncertain NEOs that contain restrictive\ncovenants related to confidentiality, non-\ncompetition, non-solicitationand ownership of\nwork product.

To this end, the CEO and\nthe other NEOs must own shares of Capital One\nstock with a fair market value of at least the\nfollowing (\u0093Stock Ownership Requirement\u0094):\n                                              \n                 Ownership      Post-Termin\u2026  \n  Role           Requirement    Ownership     \n                                Requirement   \n  CEO            $10.5          $5.25\u00a0        \n                 million        million       \n  Other\u00a0NEOs\u00a0                                 \n  and\u00a0           3x\u00a0annual\u00a0     1.5x\u00a0annual\u00a0  \n  Executive\u00a0     cash\u00a0salary    cash\u00a0salary   \n  Officers                                    \n                                              \nGiven that the CEO\u0092s compensation program does\nnot include a base salary, his Stock Ownership\nRequirement is based on an amount established\nannually by the Committee and the Independent\nDirectors. Beginning in 2020, the CEO\u0092s Stock\nOwnership Requirement was increased to an\namount equal to six multiplied by $1.75\nmillion, or $10.5 million. In addition, the\nCEO and all other NEOs are required to\ncontinue to hold 50% of their Stock Ownership\nRequirement for one year following\ntermination, retirement or ceasing to serve as\nan executive officer, except in case of\ntermination by death, disability, or in\nconnection with a change of control. The\nCommittee and the Independent Directors\nbelieve that these stock ownership\nrequirements have increased the alignment of\nCEO and all other NEO compensation with\nstockholder interests. Ownership requirements\nmay be fulfilled using the following shares:\n                                         \n  \u220e    Shares owned without restriction  \n                                         \n                                  \n  \u220e    Unvested restricted stock  \n                                  \n                                    \n  \u220e    Unvested stock-settled RSUs  \n                                    \n                                              \n  \u220e    Shares acquired through the 2002       \n       Associate Stock Purchase Plan          \n                                              \n                                              \n       Shares owned through the Capital One   \n  \u220e    Stock Fund in Capital One\u0092s 401(k)      \n       plan                                   \n                                              \nThe Committee reviews the guidelines and\nmonitors the CEO\u0092s and the other NEOs\u0092\ncompliance with them. New executive officers\nare given five years from the date of\npromotion to or appointment as an executive\nofficer to comply with the Stock Ownership\nRequirements. In the event that an executive\nofficer is not in compliance with these\nrequirements, the Committee has the right to\ntake action, including reducing the executive\nofficer\u0092s compensation. The CEO and all other\nNEOs are currently in compliance with this\nrequirement. The Company has stock retention\nrequirements for certain equity awards made to\nthe CEO and the other NEOs. With respect to\nawards of performance shares and stock-settled\nRSUs that vest (i) during an executive\u0092s term\nof employment with Capital One, or (ii) as\napplicable, prior to the first anniversary of\nsuch executive\u0092s separation from Capital One,\neach executive must hold 50% of the after-\ntaxnet shares acquired (\u0093Retained Shares\u0094) for\na period of one year after the acquisition\ndate of the shares. In addition, for\nperformance shares and stock-settled RSUs\ngranted after January 2021, the Company\nrequires that Retained Shares continue to be\nheld beyond the one-yearperiod until the CEO\nand the other NEOs\u0092 Stock Ownership\nRequirement, as described above, is met. These\nstock ownership and retention requirements\napply to all of our executive officers.\n                                              \n        CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0       \n  90    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT         \n        CORPORATION                           \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION III - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND   \n  ANALYSIS                                    \n                                              \nProhibition of Hedging, Speculative Trading\nActivities and Pledging As part of the\ncommitment by Capital One\u0092s leadership team to\nmaintain public confidence in the long-term\ngrowth of Capital One\u0092s stock, Capital One\nmaintains a policy prohibiting hedging and\nspeculative trading activities. Specifically,\nthe policy prohibits certain individuals from\nengaging in short sales, hedging transactions\nor speculative trading in derivative\nsecurities of Capital One stock. The policy\napplies to all Capital One directors, officers\n(as defined under Section 16 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 (\u0093Exchange Act\u0094), and\ntogether with Capital One directors, \u0093Control\nGroup Members\u0094) and associates who (i) serve\nat the Senior Vice President level or above,\n(ii) report directly to a Control Group\nMember, or (iii) are otherwise determined by\nCapital One\u0092s General Counsel to be an\n\u0093insider.\u0094 The policy applies to all shares of\nCapital One stock held by those persons\ncovered by the policy, regardless of whether\nthe stock was granted as compensation by\nCapital One or is otherwise held directly or\nindirectly. Capital One also prohibits its\nControl Group Members from using Capital One\nsecurities, including common stock, in a\nmargin account or pledging Capital One\nsecurities as collateral for a loan. Equity\nGrant Practices Capital One strives to\nmaintain equity grant practices that\ndemonstrate high standards of corporate\ngovernance. Annual incentive awards generally\nare approved by the Committee and the\nIndependent Directors (or by authority\ndelegated to the Chief Human Resources Officer\nfor certain associates who are not executive\nofficers) at regularly scheduled meetings in\nthe first quarter of each year. The date of\ngrant is the actual date on which the\nCommittee approves the awards. The Committee\nmay grant awards of restricted stock, RSUs,\nstock options or other equity awards outside\nof the annual incentive cycle. The Committee\nhas delegated authority to the CEO to award\nrestricted stock and to the Chief Human\nResources Officer to award stock-settled and\ncash-settled RSUs (but not options or other\nequity awards) to associates who are not\nexecutive officers, subject to a maximum\namount of $2 million for any associate in any\none year with an aggregate $50 million annual\nlimit. These awards are designed to be used\nfor new hires and for special programs\ndesigned by management to incentivize and\nreward current associates of the Company. The\nCommittee reviews all grants made by\ndelegation at least once per year. With\nrespect to awards of stock options, the\nexercise price is always the Fair Market Value\nof the Company\u0092s stock on the date of grant.\nUnder the terms of our 2004 Stock Incentive\nPlan, \u0093Fair Market Value\u0094 is equal to the\nclosing price of the Company\u0092s common stock on\nthe date of grant. The Company does not seek\nto time equity grants to take advantage of\nmaterial non-publicinformation, and in no\nevent is the grant date set to a date that is\nprior to the date of approval. Tax\nConsiderations The Committee carefully\nconsiders the tax impacts of its compensation\nprograms on the Company, as well as on its\nexecutives. To maintain flexibility in\ncompensating executive officers, the Committee\ndoes not require all compensation to be paid\nor awarded in a tax-deductiblemanner. However,\nit has been the Committee\u0092s intent to maximize\ntax deductibility to the extent reasonable and\nconsistent with the Company\u0092s overall\nexecutive compensation objectives. Prior to\nthe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of\n2017 (the \u0093TCJA\u0094), Section 162(m) of the IRC\nexempted \u0093qualified performance-based\ncompensation\u0094 from the deduction disallowance\ngenerally required by Section 162(m). The TCJA\nrepealed this exemption, such that most forms\nof performance-based compensation paid to\ncovered executive officers in excess of $1\nmillion will not be deductible going forward,\nwith certain exceptions. The Committee\nreserves the right to modify compensation that\nwas initially intended to be exempt from\nSection 162(m) if it determines that such\nmodifications are consistent with Capital\nOne\u0092s business needs.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT            91  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \nSection IV - Named Executive Officer\nCompensation\n                                   \n  2020 Summary Compensation Table  \n                                   \nThe Summary Compensation Table below provides\ninformation about compensation for the fiscal\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\nfor the NEOs. As discussed in the\n\u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0094 section\nbeginning on page 54, our executive\ncompensation program is heavily weighted\ntowards equity-based and at-riskelements of\ncompensation. Under SEC rules, equity-based\ncompensation is reported in the Summary\nCompensation Table below in the year in which\nit is awarded, which may not correlate to the\nyear for which it is paid.

Prior to November 1995,\nCapital One offered a Cash Balance Pension\nPlan (\u0093CBPP\u0094) and an Excess Cash Balance Plan\n(\u0093Excess CBPP\u0094) to all full-time salaried\nassociates and certain executive officers.\nBoth of these programs were frozen in December\n1995; however, interest continues to accrue on\nplan balances on a quarterly basis for the\nCBPP and on a monthly basis for the Excess\nCBPP. The CBPP interest rate changes annually,\nbased on the average yield of five-year U.S.\nTreasury Securities for the month of October\nof the prior plan year (1.53% for 2020). The\nExcess CBPP interest rate changes monthly\nbased on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate\n(3.69% annual average for 2020). Messrs.\nFairbank and Wassmer participated in these\nprograms. The estimated annual payouts upon\nretirement in the CBPP and the Excess CBPP as\nof December 31, 2020, are $2,448.24 and\n$8,546.88, respectively, for Mr. Fairbank, and\n$531.36 and $0, respectively, for Mr. Wassmer.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the \u0093Present Value of\nAccumulated Benefit\u0094 for Mr. Fairbank for both\nplans is equal to his account balance because\nMr. Fairbank has attained the normal\nretirement age of 65 and so is assumed to\nretire immediately under the actuarial\nvaluation assumptions. Since Mr. Fairbank is\nassumed to retire as of the measurement date,\nthe future interest rate does not apply.\nBecause Mr. Wassmer has not yet attained age\n65, the future interest rate was applied to\nhis \u0093Present Value of Accumulated Benefit\u0094\ncalculation. The account in each plan is\ndistributed after any separation from service.\nDistribution options from the CBPP plan are\nlump sum (eligible for rollover to another\nqualified plan or personal IRA) or an annuity\noption. The Excess CBPP will be distributed in\nthe same form as the CBPP, as a lump sum (not\neligible for rollover) or as an annuity.

The Committee\nreviews each executive officer\u0092s separation on\na case-by-casebasis and exercises its business\njudgment, with the approval of the Independent\nDirectors, to customize the terms of such\nseparations in consideration of the relevant\ncircumstances, including:\n                                       \n  \u220e    The reasons for the separation  \n                                       \n                                              \n  \u220e    Market competitive practices for       \n       comparable separation scenarios        \n                                              \n                                              \n       Potential benefits to the Company,     \n       such as retaining its competitive      \n       advantage, maintaining a positive      \n  \u220e    reputation                             \n       internally and externally, and         \n       preserving its ability to recruit      \n       highly talented executives             \n                                              \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  100    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION IV - NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER        \n  COMPENSATION                                \n                                              \n                                              \n  \u220e    The executive\u0092s tenure and              \n       contributions to the Company\u0092s success  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The executive\u0092s willingness to provide  \n       legal waivers and/or enter into        \n  \u220e    agreements not to compete with the     \n       Company                                \n       or to solicit the Company\u0092s associates  \n       or customers                           \n                                              \n                                              \n       The resulting impact of the            \n  \u220e    separation terms on the Company and    \n       its stockholders                       \n                                              \nRestrictive Covenants Capital One maintains a\ncompetitive advantage in part through the\nintellectual property developed and utilized\nby our senior executives. Capital One has\nasked certain NEOs to enter into various\nagreements that contain restrictive covenants\nrelated to confidentiality, non-competition,\nnon-solicitationand ownership of work product,\nas described below. Non-CompetitionAgreements\nMessrs. Blackley, Wassmer and Yajnik have\nentered into non-competitionagreements with\nthe Company pursuant to which they may be\nrestricted as to what competitive services\nthey may provide to an entity following\nseparation from Capital One. Messrs. Blackley\nand Yajnik have entered into non-\ncompetitionagreements with the Company which\nprovide for the following in exchange for the\nNEO complying with non-competitionrestrictions\nfor up to two years following an involuntary\ntermination, other than for cause, death or\ndisability: payment equal to 15% of the NEO\u0092s\ntotal target compensation for each year of\nenforcement and up to 18 months of subsidized\nhealth insurance premiums under COBRA if the\nNEO is eligible and elects such coverage,\nsubject to certain terms and conditions. The\npayments are made in two lump sums, the first\nfollowing termination and the second upon\nsuccessful completion of the enforcement\nperiod. In the event of a voluntary\ntermination, the previously described payments\nare typically made for the second year of\nenforcement only for agreements with a two-\nyearenforcement period. Mr. Wassmer has\nentered into a non-competitionagreement with\nthe Company that establishes non-\ncompetitionrestrictions for up to two years\nfollowing an involuntary termination without\ncause, and up to five years following a\nvoluntary termination or an involuntary\ntermination with cause. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, any non-competitionrestrictions\nthat apply in Canada or the United Kingdom are\nlimited to one year after termination. The\nnon-competitionagreement provides that,\nsubject to its terms, Mr. Wassmer will\nreceive: payment equal to 15% of his total\ntarget compensation for each eligible year of\nthe first and second years of his non-\ncompetitionperiod; payment equal to 20% of his\ntotal target compensation for each eligible\nyear of the third through fifth years of his\nnon-competitionperiod; and up to 18 months of\nsubsidized health insurance premiums under\nCOBRA if he is eligible and elects such\ncoverage, subject to certain terms and\nconditions. In the event of a termination of\nemployment by Capital One for any reason other\nthan death, disability or cause, the non-\ncompetepayments for the first two years are\nmade in two lump sums, the first following\ntermination and the second upon successful\ncompletion of the second year. Further, in\nsuch scenario, any additional payments for any\neligible year of the third through fifth years\nof the non-competitionperiod would be paid\nafter successful completion for each of those\nyears, respectively. In the event of a\nvoluntary termination of employment, Mr.\nWassmer would be eligible for payments only\nfor the second through fifth years of his non-\ncompetitionperiod. There are no payments under\nthe non-competitionagreements if benefits are\npayable under a change of control agreement.\nSee \u0093Change of Control\u0094 below for information\nregarding Change of Control Agreements\napplicable to the NEOs. In addition, payments\nrelated to the non-competitionagreement are\nseparate from any severance payments that may\nbe made upon the NEO\u0092s departure. However,\nseverance payments are typically offset in\npart by payments related to the non-\ncompetitionagreement so that total payment\namounts are consistent with the severance\nprogram\u0092s intent. For Mr. Wassmer, only the\npayments for years one and two of his non-\ncompetitionperiod offset any amounts payable\nto him under any severance plan or\narrangement.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           101  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION IV - NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER        \n  COMPENSATION                                \n                                              \nConfidentiality, Work Product and Non-\nSolicitationof Employee Agreement Messrs.\nBlackley, Wassmer and Yajnik are parties to\nconfidentiality, work product and non-\nsolicitationof employee agreements. The\nconfidentiality provisions of these agreements\ngenerally provide that at all times during and\nfollowing employment with the Company, these\nNEOs may not use for personal benefit or the\nbenefit of others, or divulge to others, any\nof Capital One\u0092s confidential information,\nexcept as expressly authorized by Capital One\nor required by legal process. These agreements\nalso provide that for a period of two years\nfollowing separation from Capital One, these\nNEOs shall not directly or indirectly solicit\nor induce any associate of Capital One to\nbecome employed by any person or entity\nengaged in competition with Capital One, and\nshall not directly or indirectly solicit or\ninduce any associate of Capital One to end his\nor her employment based on confidential\ninformation these NEOs learned about the\nassociate while they were employed by Capital\nOne. Payments Under Certain Termination\nScenarios Upon separation from the Company,\nthe NEOs, regardless of the reason for\ntermination, receive certain earned, but\npreviously unpaid, payments, such as accrued\nbut unused vacation pay and amounts earned and\nvested under the Company\u0092s qualified and non-\nqualifiedretirement programs. In addition,\ncash-settled RSUs granted to NEOs, other than\nthe CEO, after the end of a performance year\ncontinue to vest according to the original\nprovisions of such grants upon separation for\nany reason other than cause or as soon as\npracticable following a \u0093double trigger\u0094\nchange of control (as discussed below).\nVoluntary Termination An NEO, other than the\nCEO, who voluntarily terminates employment\nwith Capital One may receive payments related\nto non-competitioncovenants (described above,\nif applicable) and any contractual payments to\nwhich the NEO may otherwise be entitled. In\naddition, the NEO has the ability following\nseparation to exercise vested but unexercised\noptions for three months following voluntary\ntermination. Involuntary Termination Without\nCause An NEO, other than the CEO, whose\nemployment with Capital One is terminated\ninvoluntarily, for performance or job\nelimination, is entitled to receive the\namounts set forth in the Company\u0092s Executive\nSeverance Plan in exchange for executing a\nrelease of claims against the Company. For\n2020, potential payments under the Executive\nSeverance Plan were 30% of total target\ncompensation, plus a severance bonus based on\nsuch NEO\u0092s target cash incentive in the event\nof termination due to restructuring.\nAdditional benefits include healthcare\ncontinuation subsidy under COBRA, continued\ncoverage through broad-based and executive\nlife insurance programs, outplacement services\nand any contractual payments to which the NEO\nmay otherwise have been entitled. If an NEO\u0092s\nNon-CompetitionAgreement is enforced, cash\npayments under the Executive Severance Plan,\nother than the severance bonus, will be offset\nby any cash amounts paid under their\nrespective Non-CompetitionAgreement, and the\nNEO will be eligible for an additional payment\nof up to 90% of the severance payments in\nexchange for executing a release of claims\nagainst the Company. Generally, performance\nshares granted to NEOs prior to 2019 will vest\non a pro rata basis based on actual Company\nperformance during the performance period if\nan involuntary termination without cause\noccurs during the performance period, while\nperformance shares granted to NEOs in 2019 and\n2020 will vest in full, based on actual\nCompany performance, subject to the NEO\u0092s\nexecution of a release of claims against the\nCompany. Stock-settled RSUs granted to NEOs\nwill continue to vest if an involuntary\ntermination without cause occurs, subject to\nthe NEO\u0092s execution of a release of claims\nagainst the Company. In addition, NEOs have\nthe ability following separation to exercise\nvested but unexercised options for two years.\nIf a NEO\u0092s employment with Capital One is\nterminated as a result of death or disability,\nthe NEO\u0092s unvested stock options, RSUs and\nperformance shares will vest in full based on\ntarget Company performance.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  102    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION IV - NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER        \n  COMPENSATION                                \n                                              \nPayments Upon Retirement As with all\nexecutives who are eligible for retirement,\nNEOs who retire from Capital One may receive\nthe following amounts: payments related to\nnon-competitioncovenants as if they had\nterminated voluntarily (described above);\ncoverage through the executive life insurance\nprogram (at a reduced benefit); any\ncontractual payments to which he or she may\notherwise be entitled; and, for Messrs.\nFairbank and Yajnik, who became eligible to\nretire on or before December 31, 2012,\npartially subsidized participation in retiree\nmedical coverage (including dependents as\napplicable). Upon retirement, all RSUs\ncontinue to vest according to their original\nterms based on actual performance, which, for\nstock-settled RSUs granted during or after\n2012, also includes performance-based vesting\nprovisions. In addition, performance shares\ngranted to NEOs will continue to vest after\nretirement. For stock options, the executive\nhas until the expiration of the option term to\nexercise vested but unexercised options.\nTermination for Cause Generally, an NEO whose\nemployment with Capital One is terminated for\ncause receives no additional benefits but is\nrequired to comply with any applicable\nrestrictive covenants related to\nconfidentiality, non-competition, non-\nsolicitationof associates or customers, and\nownership of work product, as described above.\nIn addition, if terminated for cause, the NEOs\nhave the ability following separation to\nexercise vested but unexercised options for\nthree months. Change of Control Each NEO is a\nparty to an agreement (a \u0093Change of Control\nAgreement\u0094) that provides for certain payments\nin the event his or her employment is\nterminated within two years following (or\nwithin one year prior to but in anticipation\nof) a change of control of Capital One, either\ninvoluntarily without cause or voluntarily for\ngood reason. Amounts payable in each of these\nscenarios are outlined below. Pursuant to the\nagreements, a \u0093change of control\u0094 occurs if\none or more of the following events take\nplace: (i) an acquisition of 20% or more of\nCapital One\u0092s common stock or the combined\nvoting power of the voting securities of\nCapital One by a person or group, (ii) certain\nchanges in the majority of the Board, (iii)\nconsummation of a reorganization, merger,\nshare exchange or consolidation or similar\ntransaction, sale of all assets or the\nacquisition of another company, except where\nall or substantially all of Capital One\u0092s\nstockholders receive 50% or more of the stock\nof the resulting company, at least a majority\nof the board of directors of the resulting\ncompany were incumbent Board members, and no\nperson owns 20% or more of the resulting\ncompany who did not own such stock immediately\nbefore the business combination, or (iv)\napproval by stockholders of a complete\nliquidation or dissolution of Capital One. In\nthe event of a change of control, we do not\nprovide for excise tax gross-up payments. In\naddition, all equity awards granted to the\nNEOs require a so-called\u0093double trigger\u0094 for\naccelerated vesting in connection with a\nchange of control. Upon a change of control,\nall equity awards continue to vest according\nto their original schedule. The vesting of\nsuch awards only accelerates if a named\nexecutive officer is involuntarily terminated\nwithout cause or voluntarily terminates for\ngood reason within the two years following a\nchange of control. Termination for Cause in\nConnection with a Change of Control NEOs\nterminated involuntarily for cause following a\nchange of control receive no additional\nbenefits except with regard to options, which\nallow NEOs to exercise vested but unexercised\noptions for three months following a\ntermination for cause.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           103  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION IV - NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER        \n  COMPENSATION                                \n                                              \nVoluntary Termination with Good Reason or\nInvoluntary Termination Without Cause in\nConnection with a Change of Control In the\nevent of a voluntary termination with good\nreason or an involuntary termination without\ncause, the potential payments that the NEOs\ncould receive under certain termination\nscenarios are based on a percentage of total\ntarget compensation.

As a\nresult, the pay ratio reported by other\ncompanies may not be comparable to the pay\nratio reported above, as other companies have\ndifferent employee populations and\ncompensation practices and may utilize\ndifferent methodologies, exclusions, estimates\nand assumptions in calculating their own pay\nratios.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  106    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \nSection V - Equity Compensation Plans\n                                        \n  Equity Compensation Plan Information  \n                                        \nThe following table provides information as of\nDecember 31, 2020, with respect to our equity\ncompensation plans under which shares of\nCapital One common stock are authorized to be\nissued.\n                                              \n                                      Number  \n                                          of  \n               Number                securi\u2026  \n                   of                remain\u2026  \n             securit\u2026    Weighte\u2026    availa\u2026  \n                to\u00a0be    exercise        for  \n               issued       price     future  \n                 upon          of    issuan\u2026  \n             exercise    outstan\u2026      under  \n                   of    options,     equity  \n             outstan\u2026    warrants    compen\u2026  \n             options,         and      plans  \n             warrants      rights    (exclu\u2026  \n                  and                securi\u2026  \n               rights                reflec\u2026  \n                                          in  \n                                      column  \n                                        (a))  \n  Plan             -a          -b         -c  \n  Catego\u2026                                     \n  Equity                                      \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plans                                       \n  approv\u2026    7,760,7\u2026      $63.91    17,906\u2026  \n  by \u00a0\u00a0                                       \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  holder\u2026                                     \n  Equity                                      \n  compen\u2026                                     \n  plans                                       \n  not        33,712(\u2026           $\u0097        \u0097(5)  \n  approv\u2026                                     \n  by \u00a0\u00a0                                       \n  securi\u2026                                     \n  holders                                     \n  Total      7,794,4\u2026      $63.91    17,906\u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n       The following plans have been          \n       approved by Capital One stockholders   \n  (1)  and are currently in effect: the 2004  \n       Stock                                  \n       Incentive Plan and the 2002 Associate  \n       Stock Purchase Plan.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n       Excludes purchase rights accruing      \n       under the 2002 Associate Stock         \n       Purchase Plan.

Our Audit Committee is composed of\nfive Board members. Our Board has determined\nthat all Audit Committee members are\nindependent under Capital One\u0092s Director\nIndependence Standards, which have been\nadopted by the Board as part of Capital One\u0092s\nCorporate Governance Guidelines. Each member\nof the Audit Committee is \u0093financially\nliterate\u0094 in the judgment of the Board. The\nAudit Committee met 11 times in 2020. Audit\nCommittee Policies and Procedures The Audit\nCommittee has implemented procedures to enable\nit to devote the attention it deems\nappropriate to each of the matters assigned to\nit under its charter, including candid\ncommunications with management and Ernst &\nYoung LLP (\u0093Ernst & Young\u0094), Capital One\u0092s\nindependent registered public accounting firm,\nto discuss new auditing standards and emerging\naudit-related issues. In carrying out its\nresponsibilities, the Audit Committee met a\ntotal of 11 times during 2020. Pursuant to\nCapital One\u0092s Corporate Governance Guidelines\nand applicable law, the Audit Committee is\ncomprised solely of independent directors.\nRequired Communications with Ernst & Young In\ndischarging its oversight responsibility\nthroughout the year, the Audit Committee\nproactively engaged with management and Ernst\n& Young on matters relating to Capital One\nfinancial reporting. The Audit Committee has\nreviewed and discussed Capital One\u0092s audited\nfinancial statements for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, and the assessment of the\neffectiveness of Capital One\u0092s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, with\nmanagement and Ernst & Young. The Audit\nCommittee has also discussed with Ernst &\nYoung the matters required to be discussed\nunder the applicable standards of the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board. In\naddition, the Audit Committee has received the\nwritten disclosures and the letter from Ernst\n& Young required by the applicable\nrequirements of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board regarding Ernst & Young\u0092s\ncommunications with the Audit Committee\nconcerning independence and has discussed with\nErnst & Young their independence from Capital\nOne.

The Audit\nCommittee evaluates the independent registered\npublic accounting firm\u0092s qualifications,\nperformance and independence at least annually\nand periodically considers whether to continue\nto retain our current independent registered\npublic accounting firm or engage another firm.\nIn connection with applicable partner rotation\nrequirements, the Audit Committee and its\nChair are involved in considering the\nselection of the independent registered public\naccounting firm\u0092s new lead partner and\nconcurring/reviewing partner. Additionally,\nCapital One adheres to the requirements of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u0093Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct\u0094) relating to the rotation of partners\nengaged in Capital One\u0092s audit by the\nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nFor 2021, the Audit Committee has appointed\nErnst & Young as Capital One\u0092s independent\nregistered public accounting firm. Ernst &\nYoung has served in this role since 1994. The\nmembers of the Audit Committee and the Board\nbelieve that the continued retention of Ernst\n& Young as Capital One\u0092s independent\nregistered public accounting firm is in the\nbest interests of Capital One and its\nstockholders. The Board is submitting this\nproposal to the vote of the stockholders as a\nmatter of good corporate governance. If\nstockholders do not ratify the selection of\nErnst & Young, the Audit Committee will\nreconsider the appointment of Ernst & Young as\nthe Company\u0092s independent registered public\naccounting firm. Even if the selection is\nratified, the Audit Committee may, in its\ndiscretion, appoint a different independent\nregistered public accounting firm at any time\nduring the year if the Audit Committee\ndetermines that such a change would be in our\nstockholders\u0092 best interests.

The\nAudit Committee has reviewed the fees paid to\nErnst & Young and has considered whether the\nfees paid for non-Auditservices are compatible\nwith maintaining Ernst & Young\u0092s independence.\nThe Audit Committee also adopted policies and\nprocedures to approve services provided by\nErnst & Young in accordance with the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act and rules of the SEC promulgated\nthereunder. These policies and procedures\ninvolve annual pre-approvalby the Audit\nCommittee of the types of services to be\nprovided by Capital One\u0092s independent\nregistered public accounting firm and fee\nlimits for each type of service on both a per\nengagement and aggregate level. Any service\nengagements that exceed these pre-\napprovedlimits must be submitted to the Audit\nCommittee for specific pre-approval.In 2020,\nall of the Audit and Audit-Related Fees and\nrelated services were pre-approvedby the Audit\nCommittee pursuant to the policies and\nprocedures described above. Under the policy\nadopted by the Audit Committee, Tax Fees are\nlimited to 25% of combined Audit and Audit-\nRelated Fees, and services that would fall\nunder the category \u0093All Other Fees\u0094 are\nprohibited. One or more representatives of\nErnst & Young are expected to be present at\nthe 2021 Annual Stockholder Meeting. They will\nhave the opportunity to make a statement if\nthey desire to do so and will be available to\nrespond to appropriate questions from\nstockholders. *** The Board of Directors\nunanimously recommends that you vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the\nratification of Ernst & Young LLP as Capital\nOne\u0092s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2021.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           115  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \nSection XI - Advisory Approval of Capital\nOne\u0092s 2020 Named Executive Officer\nCompensation (Item 3 on Proxy Card) We are\noffering to our stockholders a non-\nbindingadvisory vote to approve our 2020 named\nexecutive officer compensation, pursuant to\nSection 14A of the Exchange Act. While the\nvote is non-binding,the Board of Directors\nvalues the opinions that stockholders express\nthrough their votes and in any additional\ndialogue. The Board of Directors will consider\nthe outcome of the vote when making future\ncompensation decisions. As discussed in the\n\u0093Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u0094 section\nbeginning on page 54, our Board of Directors\ngenerally has provided compensation programs\nfor the CEO and the other NEOs that are\ncompetitive with the market, performance-based\nand transparent and that align with our\nstockholders\u0092 interests over multiple time\nhorizons. Our CEO\u0092s and other NEOs\u0092\ncompensation programs generally have consisted\nprimarily of performance-based incentive\nopportunities, including multiple types of\nequity instruments with multi-year vesting\nschedules. The ultimate value of these equity-\nbased awards is subject to Capital One\u0092s\nsustained performance over time, both on an\nabsolute basis and relative to our peers. For\n2020, approximately 84% of the CEO\u0092s total\ncompensation is equity-based and at-riskto the\nperformance of the Company\u0092s stock price, and\n100% of his compensation is deferred for a\nthree-year period. As discussed under \u0093NEO\nCompensation\u0094 beginning on page 79, under the\n2020 NEO compensation program applicable to\nour other NEOs, approximately 55% of total\ncompensation was provided through equity-based\nvehicles which were all at-riskbased on the\nperformance of the Company\u0092s stock price and\nsubject to vesting over multiple time\nhorizons. Additional information relevant to\nyour vote can be found under \u0093Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis\u0094 on pages 54 to 91 and\n\u0093Named Executive Officer Compensation\u0094 section\non pages 92 to 106. We ask for your approval\nof the following resolution: \u0093Resolved, that\nCapital One\u0092s stockholders hereby provide\ntheir advisory approval of the 2020 Named\nExecutive Officer compensation as disclosed\npursuant to the rules of the SEC in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis, the\nSummary Compensation Table, the other\ncompensation tables and the related notes and\nnarratives in this proxy statement.\u0094 The Board\nof Directors has resolved to hold annual\nadvisory votes to approve executive\ncompensation. Accordingly, the next advisory\nvote to approve executive compensation will\noccur at the 2022 Annual Stockholder Meeting,\nunless the Board of Directors modifies its\npolicy on the frequency of holding such\nadvisory votes. *** The Board of Directors\nunanimously recommends that you vote \u0093FOR\u0094\napproval, on an advisory basis, of our 2020\nNamed Executive Officer compensation as\ndisclosed in this proxy statement.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  116    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \nSection XII - Approval and Adoption of the\nCapital One Financial Corporation Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan\n(Item 4 on Proxy Card) Overview In 2004 the\nBoard of Directors adopted the Capital One\nFinancial Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive\nPlan (the \u00932004 Plan\u0094), which was approved by\nthe Company\u0092s stockholders at the annual\nmeeting of stockholders held on April 29,\n2004. The 2004 Plan was subsequently\nresubmitted for approval, and approved, by\nstockholders, at the annual meetings held on\nApril 27, 2006, April 23, 2009 and May 1, 2014\nin order to increase the number of shares\navailable for issuance under the 2004 Plan and\nto make certain other changes as detailed in\nthe respective proxy statement proposals for\nstockholder approval. The Compensation\nCommittee of the Board of Directors approved\nand adopted the Fourth Amended and Restated\n2004 Stock Incentive Plan effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2018 to make certain non-\nmaterialchanges. The Fifth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan was\nsubmitted for approval, and subsequently\napproved, by stockholders at the annual\nmeeting held on May 2, 2019 to account for\nchanges to Section 162(m) of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094).\nOn February 4, 2021, the Compensation\nCommittee adopted, subject to stockholder\napproval, an amended and restated version of\nthe 2004 Plan (the \u0093Sixth Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan\u0094) to (1) extend the duration of the\n2004 Plan so that it will terminate ten (10)\nyears following the date of the 2021 Annual\nStockholder Meeting, and (2) increase the\nshare reserve under the 2004 Plan by 12\nmillion shares from 55 million shares to 67\nmillion shares. In addition, the Compensation\nCommittee approved certain non-materialchanges\nto the 2004 Plan that are not subject to\nstockholder approval in order to align the\n2004 Plan with current market practice to\nreduce liberal share recycling and to include\n\u0093double trigger\u0094 change of control provisions,\nas described in greater detail below, and as\nreflected in the Sixth Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan, which is provided in its entirety\nas Appendix B to this proxy statement. The\nSixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will be\napproved by stockholders if a majority of the\nvotes cast by stockholders on the proposal are\nvoted in favor of the proposal. NYSE rules\ngoverning equity compensation plans treat\nabstentions as \u0093votes cast.\u0094 Accordingly,\nabstentions will have the same effect as a\nvote against the proposal. However, broker\nnon-votesare not considered \u0093votes cast\u0094 and\nthus will have no effect on the outcome of the\nvote on this proposal. If the Sixth Amended\nand Restated 2004 Plan is not approved by our\nstockholders, the Fifth Amended and Restated\n2004 Stock Incentive Plan will remain in\neffect in its current form, and we will\ncontinue to be able to grant equity incentive\nawards under the Fifth Amended and Restated\n2004 Stock Incentive Plan until its\nexpiration, subject to the current 2004 Plan\nShare reserve. However, the current 2004 Plan\nShare reserve is not sufficient to cover the\nawards anticipated to be granted beginning in\n2022 and therefore we would not be able to\nmaintain our current equity granting\npractices. Specifically, the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan makes the following changes\nthat are subject to stockholder approval:\n                                              \n       Provides for a date of termination on  \n       May\u00a06, 2031, which is ten (10)\u00a0years   \n  \u220e    following the date of the 2021         \n       Annual Stockholder Meeting (see        \n       Section\u00a01.3 of the 2004 Plan); and     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Provides that the maximum number of    \n       Shares (as defined below) available    \n  \u220e    for issuance to participants under     \n       the 2004 Plan                          \n       shall be 67\u00a0million (see Section\u00a0      \n       4.1(a) of the 2004 Plan).              \n                                              \nThe 2004 Plan, amended as of May 1, 2014,\ncreated a reserve of 55 million shares of\nCapital One common stock (each a \u0093Share,\u0094\ncollectively, the \u0093Shares\u0094). The 2004 Plan\nShare reserve is not sufficient to cover the\nawards anticipated to be granted beginning in\n2022 and therefore we are asking for\nstockholders to approve an increase of 12\nmillion Shares in the 2004 Plan\u0092s Share\nreserve at this time. The Compensation\nCommittee and the Board of Directors believe\nthat compensating Capital One executives and\nassociates with equity awards encourages the\ncreation of long-term stockholder value and\nthe delivery of consistent medium- and long-\nterm results.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           117  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION XII - APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE  \n  CAPITAL                                     \n  ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION SIXTH AMENDED     \n  AND                                         \n  RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (ITEM 4  \n  ON                                          \n  PROXY CARD)                                 \n                                              \nSummary of Material Provisions of the Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan\nThe material terms of the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan are summarized below and\nare qualified in their entirety by reference\nto the full text of the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan, which is provided as\nAppendix B to this proxy statement. Because\nthis is a summary, it may not contain all the\ninformation that you may consider important,\nand thus, we encourage you to read the full\ntext of the Sixth Amended and Restated 2004\nPlan. Types of Awards Awards under the Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan may be in the\nform of: (i) cash-based awards; (ii) options,\nwhich may be incentive stock options, as\ndefined in the Code (\u0093ISOs\u0094) (which are tax\nadvantageous for the participant but with\nrespect to which Capital One does not receive\na deduction) or non-qualifiedstock options\n(\u0093NQSOs\u0094); (iii) stock appreciation rights\n(\u0093SARs\u0094); (iv) restricted stock; (v)\nrestricted stock units (\u0093RSUs\u0094); (vi)\nperformance shares; (vii) performance units;\n(viii) annual incentive pool awards; or (ix)\nother stock-based awards (\u0093Other Stock-Based\nAwards\u0094) (collectively, \u0093Awards\u0094). Duration of\nthe Sixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan The\nSixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan was\namended and restated as of January 1, 2021\n(the \u0093Restatement Effective Date\u0094) and will\nbecome effective upon stockholder approval.\nUnless terminated sooner as provided therein,\nthe Sixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will\nterminate on May 6, 2031, which is ten (10)\nyears from the 2021 Annual Stockholder Meeting\nbeing held on May 6, 2021. After the Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan is terminated,\nno new Awards may be granted under the 2004\nPlan. Awards previously granted will remain\noutstanding in accordance with the terms and\nconditions of the Sixth Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan and as specified under the\napplicable grant agreement. Shares Available\nfor Awards The total number of Shares\navailable for issuance under the Sixth Amended\nand Restated 2004 Plan, subject to adjustment\nin accordance with certain anti-dilution\nprovisions described below, is proposed to be\nincreased by 12 million Shares, from an\naggregate amount of 55 million Shares to an\naggregate amount of 67 million Shares. Shares\ncovered by an Award will only be counted as\nused under the authorized Shares set forth in\nthe Sixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan to\nthe extent they are actually issued and\ndelivered to a participant or such\nparticipant\u0092s designated transferee and are\nnot forfeited by the participant and returned\nto Capital One. Any Shares that are related to\nAwards which terminate by expiration,\nforfeiture, cancellation, or otherwise without\nthe issuance of Shares, which are forfeited by\nthe participant to Capital One (including\npursuant to performance based vesting\nconditions), which are settled in cash in lieu\nof Shares, or which (subject to the 2004\nPlan\u0092s prohibition on repricing, cashing out\nor exchanging out of the out-of-the-moneystock\noptions or stock appreciation rights) are\nexchanged with the Compensation Committee\u0092s\npermission prior to the issuance of Shares for\nAwards not involving the issuance or delivery\nof Shares, will be available again for grant\nunder the Sixth Amended and Restated 2004\nPlan. The Compensation Committee has approved\nadditional limitations on share usage as\nspecified in Section 4.2(b) of the 2004 Plan,\nin order to align the terms of the 2004 Plan\nwith the Company\u0092s current practice. As\napproved, the following Shares covered by an\nAward are counted as used under the authorized\nShares under the Sixth Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan and may not be added to the maximum\nnumber of Shares that may be issued:\n                                              \n       Shares that are withheld or tendered   \n       in payment of an option exercise       \n  \u220e    price or repurchased by the Company    \n       with Option                            \n       exercise proceeds;                     \n                                              \n                                              \n       Shares that are withheld or tendered   \n       to satisfy any tax withholding         \n       obligation (in connection with any     \n       option, SAR, or                        \n  \u220e    Other Stock-Based Award or otherwise)  \n       or Shares that are covered by a SAR    \n       (to the extent that it is settled in   \n       Shares, without regard to the number   \n       of Shares that are actually issued     \n       upon exercise); and                    \n                                              \n                                              \n       Shares that are withheld by the        \n  \u220e    Company to satisfy any debt or other   \n       obligation owed to the Company or any  \n       Subsidiary.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  118    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION XII - APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE  \n  CAPITAL                                     \n  ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION SIXTH AMENDED     \n  AND                                         \n  RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (ITEM 4  \n  ON                                          \n  PROXY CARD)                                 \n                                              \nExcept to the extent otherwise required by\napplicable law or stock exchange rules, the\nmaximum number of Shares available for\nissuance under the Sixth Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan will not be reduced to reflect any\ndividends or dividend equivalents that are\nreinvested into additional Shares or credited\nas additional restricted stock, RSUs,\nperformance shares, or Other Stock-Based\nAwards.

As stated\nabove, the basis for participation in the\nSixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan is the\nCompensation Committee\u0092s decision to select,\nin its sole discretion, participants from\namong those eligible. The approximate number\nof individuals eligible to be granted Awards\nunder the Sixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan\nas of December 31, 2020 were 51,985 employees,\n11 non-managementdirectors and 26,800 Third\nParty Service Providers, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, there were no Third Party\nService Providers with outstanding awards\nunder the Sixth Amended and Restated 2004\nPlan. In lieu of making Awards directly to\nemployees, directors or Third Party Service\nProviders, the Compensation Committee may make\nAwards under the Sixth Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan through or to a trust or other\nfunding vehicle which then makes Awards to\nparticipants or which issues interests in\nAwards held by it to participants, on such\nterms and conditions as determined by the\nCompensation Committee. General Terms and\nConditions of Awards In general, and subject\nto the terms and provisions of the Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan (including\nthose described below), Awards may be granted\nto participants on such dates, in such form\nand number and upon such terms and conditions\n(including the effect, if any, of a Change of\nControl, death, Disability or Retirement (as\neach such term is defined in the Sixth Amended\nand Restated 2004 Plan)) as determined from\ntime to time by the Compensation Committee.\nEach Award granted will be evidenced by an\nAward agreement that will specify such terms\nand conditions. In addition, each\nparticipant\u0092s Award agreement will set forth\nthe extent to which the participant will have\nthe right to exercise, retain or receive an\nAward or to have such Award vest or pay out,\nas applicable, following the termination of\nsuch participant\u0092s employment with, or\nprovision of services to, Capital One, its\naffiliates or subsidiaries, as the case may\nbe. Except as otherwise provided in the Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan, in a\nparticipant\u0092s Award agreement or as otherwise\ndetermined at any time by the Compensation\nCommittee, no Award granted under the Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan may be sold,\ntransferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise\nalienated or hypothecated, other than by will\nor by the laws of descent and distribution.\nThe Compensation Committee may specify in an\nAward agreement that the participant\u0092s rights,\npayments and benefits with respect to an Award\nwill be subject to reduction, cancellation,\nforfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence\nof certain specified events, in addition to\nany otherwise applicable vesting or\nperformance conditions. Failure by a\nparticipant to comply with any of the terms\nand conditions of the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan or any Award agreement will\nbe grounds for the cancellation and forfeiture\nof such Award. Restricted Stock and Restricted\nStock Units. The Compensation Committee may\ngrant to a participant Shares of restricted\nstock and/or RSUs. RSUs are similar to Shares\nof restricted stock except that no Shares are\nactually awarded to the participant on the\ndate of grant. The Shares of restricted stock\nand/or the RSUs granted to a participant under\nthe Sixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will\nnot be transferable until the end of the\napplicable period of restriction established\nby the Compensation Committee (and in the case\nof RSUs until the date of delivery of Shares\nor other payment), or upon earlier\nsatisfaction of any other conditions as\nspecified by the Compensation Committee. The\nCompensation Committee will impose such other\nconditions and/or restrictions on any Shares\nof restricted stock or RSUs as it may deem\nadvisable, including a requirement that the\nparticipant pay a stipulated purchase price\nfor each Share of restricted stock or each\nRSU, restrictions based upon achievement of\nperformance goals, service-based restrictions\nand/or restrictions under applicable laws or\nunder the requirements of any stock exchange\nor securities market upon which such Shares\nare listed or traded. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, imposing restrictions based upon the\nachievement of performance goals will not\nresult in Shares of restricted stock or RSUs\nbeing converted to performance shares or\nperformance units for purposes of the Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan, including for\npurposes of the annual award limits described\nabove. Generally, Shares of restricted stock\nwill become freely transferable by the\nparticipant after all conditions and\nrestrictions applicable to such Shares have\nbeen satisfied or lapse (including\nsatisfaction of applicable tax withholding\nobligations) and RSUs will be settled in cash,\nShares or a combination of cash and Shares, as\nthe Compensation Committee determines. To the\nextent permitted by law, unless otherwise\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee and\nset forth in an Award agreement, participants\nholding Shares of restricted stock will be\ngranted the right to exercise full voting\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           121  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION XII - APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE  \n  CAPITAL                                     \n  ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION SIXTH AMENDED     \n  AND                                         \n  RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (ITEM 4  \n  ON                                          \n  PROXY CARD)                                 \n                                              \nrights and to receive all dividends and other\ndistributions paid with respect to those\nShares during the period of restriction, while\nrecipients of RSUs will not be granted such\nrights, dividends or distributions during the\nperiod of restriction, except as specifically\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee and\nas permitted by law. Performance Units and\nPerformance Shares .The Compensation Committee\nmay grant performance units and/or performance\nshares to participants under the Sixth Amended\nand Restated 2004 Plan in such amounts and\nupon such terms as the Compensation Committee\ndetermines. Each performance unit will have an\ninitial value that is established by the\nCompensation Committee at the time of grant\nand each performance share will have an\ninitial value equal to the fair market value\nof a Share on the date of grant. In addition\nto any non-performanceterms set forth by the\nCompensation Committee, the Compensation\nCommittee will set performance goals which,\ndepending on the extent to which they are met,\nwill determine the value and/or number of\nperformance units or performance shares to be\npaid out to participants. In accordance with\nthe Award agreements, participants will be\nentitled to payment, in the form of cash\nand/or Shares, equal to the value and number\nof applicable performance units and\nperformance shares earned by participants over\nthe designated performance period following\nthe end of such performance period. Options.\nThe Compensation Committee may grant to a\nparticipant the right to purchase Shares in\nsuch amounts and upon such terms as the\nCompensation Committee determines (including\nin satisfaction of Capital One\u0092s obligations\npursuant to options with reload features\ngranted under the prior stock incentive\nplans), subject to the following restrictions.\nAn option may be granted as an ISO or as a\nnon-qualifiedstock option, as determined by\nthe Compensation Committee and as set forth in\nany applicable Award agreement. The exercise\nprice per Share will be determined by the\nCompensation Committee and may be at, above or\nindexed to, the fair market value of a Share\non the date of grant; provided that, in no\nevent will the exercise price per Share be\nless than 100% of the fair market value of a\nShare on the date of grant. Options granted\nunder the Sixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan\nwill vest and become exercisable at such time\nand upon such terms and conditions as may be\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee;\nprovided that no option will be exercisable\nlater than the tenth (10th) anniversary of its\ndate of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\noptions granted to participants outside of the\nUnited States may have a term of greater than\nten (10) years. The purchase price for the\nShares as to which an option is exercised will\nbe paid to Capital One in full at the time of\nexercise (i) in cash or its equivalent; (ii)\nin Shares having a fair market value equal to\nthe aggregate exercise price for the Shares\nbeing purchased and satisfying such other\nrequirements as may be imposed by the\nCompensation Committee; (iii) partly in cash\nand partly in such Shares; (iv) by a cashless\n(broker-assisted) exercise; or (v) by any\nother method approved or accepted by the\nCompensation Committee. The Compensation\nCommittee may impose such restrictions on any\nShares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an\noption granted under the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan as it may deem advisable,\nincluding, without limitation, minimum holding\nperiod requirements, restrictions under\napplicable federal securities laws, under the\nrequirements of any stock exchange or market\nupon which such Shares are then listed and/or\ntraded, or under any blue sky or state\nsecurities laws applicable to such Shares. The\nCompensation Committee is not permitted to\ngrant options containing, or amend options\npreviously granted to include, reload features\nproviding for the automatic grant of options\nwith respect to the number of already owned\nShares delivered by the participant to\nexercise options. SARs. The Compensation\nCommittee may grant to a participant an SAR\nindependent of an option or in tandem with an\noption or designated portion thereof at the\ntime the related option is granted or at any\ntime prior to the exercise or cancellation of\nthe related option. The grant price of an SAR\nthat is either granted independently of any\noptions or the exercise of which does not\nrequire the forfeiture of any rights under a\nrelated option (a \u0093Freestanding SAR\u0094) will be\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee;\nprovided that, in no event will the grant\nprice per Share be less than 100% of the fair\nmarket value of a Share on the date of grant.\nThe grant price of an SAR that is granted in\nconnection with a related option and the\nexercise of which requires the forfeiture of\nthe right to purchase Shares under the related\noption (a \u0093Tandem SAR\u0094) will be equal to the\nexercise price of the related option. The term\nof an SAR granted under the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan will be determined by the\nCompensation Committee; provided that no SAR\nwill be exercisable later than the tenth\n(10th) anniversary of the date of its grant.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, SARs granted to\nparticipants outside of the United States may\nhave a term of greater than ten (10) years.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  122    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION XII - APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE  \n  CAPITAL                                     \n  ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION SIXTH AMENDED     \n  AND                                         \n  RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (ITEM 4  \n  ON                                          \n  PROXY CARD)                                 \n                                              \nFreestanding SARs may be exercised upon the\nterms and conditions as imposed by the\nCompensation Committee and Tandem SARs may\nonly be exercised with respect to all or part\nof the Shares subject to the related option\nupon the surrender of the right to exercise\nthe equivalent portion of the related option.\nUpon the exercise of an SAR, the participant\nwill be entitled to receive, with respect to\neach Share to which such SAR relates, an\namount in cash and/or Shares, as the case may\nbe, equal to the excess of (i) the fair market\nvalue of a Share on the date of exercise over\n(ii) the grant price of the SAR. The\nCompensation Committee may impose such\nrestrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant\nto the exercise of an SAR granted under the\nSixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan as it may\ndeem advisable, including, without limitation,\na requirement that the participant hold the\nShares received upon exercise of an SAR for a\nspecified period of time. Cash-Based Awards\nand Other Stock-Based Awards. The Compensation\nCommittee may grant cash-based Awards and\nOther Stock-Based Awards to participants, in\nsuch amounts and upon such terms and\nconditions as the Compensation Committee may\ndetermine. Other Stock-Based Awards may\ninclude Awards designed to comply with or take\nadvantage of the applicable local laws of\njurisdictions outside of the United States.\nEach cash-based Award will specify a payment\namount or payment range and each Other Stock-\nBased Award will be expressed in terms of\nShares or units based on Shares, each as\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee. The\nCompensation Committee may also establish any\nperformance goals with respect to cash-based\nAwards or Other Stock-Based Awards, in which\ncase the number and/or value of cash-based\nAwards or Other Stock-Based Awards that will\nbe paid out to the participant will depend on\nthe extent to which the performance goals (and\nany other non-performanceterms and conditions)\nare met. Payment with respect to a cash-based\nAward or Other Stock-Based Award will be made\nin accordance with the terms of the Award, in\ncash and/or Shares as determined by the\nCompensation Committee. Performance-Based\nCompensation. The Compensation Committee may\ngrant Awards to participants that are subject\nto performance goals upon which the grant,\npayment or vesting of an Award may occur. The\nperformance goals will be set at the\ndiscretion of the Compensation Committee and\ncan include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing performance measures, either\nindividually, alternatively, or in any\ncombination, applied to either Capital One as\na whole or to a business unit or subsidiary or\naffiliate or any combination thereof, either\nindividually, alternatively or in any\ncombination, and measured either annually or\ncumulatively over a period of years, on an\nabsolute basis or relative to a pre-\nestablishedtarget, to previous years\u0092 results\nor to a designated comparison group, in each\ncase as specified by the Compensation\nCommittee: net earnings or net income (before\nor after taxes); earnings per share; net sales\ngrowth; net operating profit; return measures\n(including, but not limited to return on\nassets, capital, equity or sales); cash flow\n(including, but not limited to, operating cash\nflow, free cash flow, and cash flow return on\ncapital); cash flow per share; earnings before\nor after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or\namortization; gross or operating margins;\nproductivity ratios; share price (including,\nbut not limited to, growth measures and total\nstockholder return); expense targets or\nratios; charge-offlevels; revenue growth;\ndeposit growth; margins; operating efficiency;\noperating expenses; economic value added;\nimprovement in or attainment of expense\nlevels; improvement in or attainment of\nworking capital levels; debt reduction;\ncapital targets; consummation of acquisitions,\ndispositions, projects or other specific\nevents or transactions; and any other\nperformance goal that the Compensation\nCommittee deems appropriate. The Compensation\nCommittee may provide for accelerated vesting\nof any Award based on the achievement of\nperformance goals pursuant to the performance\nmeasures set forth by the Compensation\nCommittee with respect to such Award. The\nCompensation Committee will determine whether,\nwith respect to a performance period, the\napplicable performance goals have been met\nwith respect to a given participant and, if\nthey have, to so certify and ascertain the\namount of the applicable Award. The\nCompensation Committee may provide in any such\nAward that any evaluation of performance may\ninclude or exclude any of the following events\nthat occurs during a performance period: (a)\nasset write-downs, (b) litigation or claim\njudgments or settlements, (c) the effect of\nchanges in tax laws, accounting principles or\nregulations, or other laws or provisions\naffecting reported results, (d) any\nreorganization and restructuring programs, (e)\nextraordinary, unusual, and/or nonrecurring\nitems of gain or loss as defined under United\nStates generally accepted accounting\nprinciples for the applicable year, (f)\nmergers, acquisitions or divestitures, and (g)\nforeign exchange gains and losses.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           123  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION XII - APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE  \n  CAPITAL                                     \n  ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION SIXTH AMENDED     \n  AND                                         \n  RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (ITEM 4  \n  ON                                          \n  PROXY CARD)                                 \n                                              \nAnnual Incentive Pool Awards. The Compensation\nCommittee may designate employees who are\neligible to receive a monetary payment in any\nplan year based upon a percentage of an\nincentive pool equal to the greater of (i) 3%\nof Capital One\u0092s Consolidated Operating\nEarnings for the plan year, (ii) 20% of\nCapital One\u0092s Operating Cash Flow for the plan\nyear, and (iii) 5% of Capital One\u0092s Net Income\nfor the plan year (as each such term is\ndefined in the Sixth Amended and Restated 2004\nPlan). The Compensation Committee will\nallocate an incentive pool percentage to each\nparticipating employee for each plan year;\nprovided that the incentive pool percentage\nfor any one participant may not exceed 50% of\nthe total pool, the sum of the incentive pool\npercentages for all participants cannot exceed\n100% of the total pool and the monetary\npayment for any one participant may not exceed\n$10,000,000. As soon as possible following the\ndetermination of the incentive pool for a plan\nyear, the Compensation Committee will\ncalculate each participant\u0092s portion of the\nincentive pool based upon the percentage\nestablished at the beginning of the plan year.\nThe Compensation Committee retains the\ndiscretion to adjust incentive pool downwards\nand provide for such other terms as it feels\nnecessary or appropriate. Dividend\nEquivalents. The Compensation Committee may\ngrant dividend equivalents to any participant\nbased on the dividends declared on Shares that\nare subject to any Award. Such dividend\nequivalents may be awarded or paid in the form\nof cash, Shares, restricted stock, RSUs or a\ncombination thereof and will be determined by\nsuch formula and at such time and be subject\nto such accrual, forfeiture or payout\nrestrictions or limitations as determined by\nthe Compensation Committee in its discretion.\nDeferrals. The Compensation Committee may\npermit or require a participant to defer his\nor her receipt of the payment of cash or the\ndelivery of Shares that would otherwise be due\nto such participant by virtue of the lapse or\nwaiver of restrictions with respect to Shares\nof restricted stock or RSUs, or the\nsatisfaction of any requirements or\nperformance goals with respect to performance\nshares, performance units, cash-based Awards,\nOther Stock-Based Awards and annual incentive\npool Awards. If any such deferral is required\nor permitted, the Compensation Committee will\nestablish rules and procedures for such\npayment or Share delivery and any notional\nearnings to be credited on such deferred\namounts, provided that in the case of any\nAward intended to qualify as \u0093performance-\nbased compensation,\u0094 as such term was defined\nin Section 162(m) of the Code on December 21,\n2017, such earnings will be in compliance with\nCode Section 162(m). Amendment, Modification,\nSuspension and Termination; No Repricings. The\nCompensation Committee may, at any time,\nalter, amend, modify, suspend or terminate the\nSixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan and any\nAward agreement in whole or in part; provided,\nhowever, that no amendment of the Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Plan or an Award\nwill be made without stockholder approval if\nstockholder approval is required by law,\nregulation, or stock exchange rule.\nFurthermore, other than in connection with a\nchange in Capital One\u0092s capitalization, the\nCompensation Committee will not, without\nstockholder approval, reduce the exercise\nprice or grant price of a previously awarded\noption or SAR and, at any time when the\nexercise price or grant price of the\npreviously awarded option or SAR is above the\nfair market value of a Share, the Compensation\nCommittee will not, without stockholder\napproval, cancel and re-grantor exchange such\noption or SAR for cash or a new Award with a\nlower (or no) exercise price or grant price or\ntake any other action that would be considered\na repricing for purposes of United States\ngenerally accepted accounting principles or\nany applicable stock exchange rule. No\ntermination, amendment, suspension or\nmodification of the Sixth Amended and Restated\n2004 Plan or an Award agreement will\nmaterially adversely affect any Award\npreviously granted under the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan without the written consent\nof the participant holding such Award. The\nCompensation Committee may, however, terminate\nany Award previously granted and any Award\nagreement relating thereto in whole or in part\nupon payment of certain consideration (as set\nforth in the Sixth Amended and Restated 2004\nPlan) or, in the case of options only, thirty\n(30) days after an acceleration of\nexercisability. The Compensation Committee may\nauthorize the repurchase of any Award by\nCapital One at any time for such price and on\nsuch terms and conditions as the Compensation\nCommittee may determine, provided that without\nthe prior approval of Capital One\u0092s\nstockholders, the Compensation Committee may\nnot permit the repurchase by Capital One of\noptions or SARs with an exercise price or\ngrant price, respectively, above the fair\nmarket value of the Shares at the time of such\nrepurchase.

In order to comply with the laws in\nother jurisdictions in which Capital One, its\naffiliates or its subsidiaries operate or have\nemployees, directors or Third Party Service\nProviders, the Compensation Committee will\nhave the power to (i) determine which\naffiliates and subsidiaries will be covered by\nthe Sixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, (ii)\ndetermine which employees, directors and Third\nParty Service Providers outside of the United\nStates are eligible to participate in the\nSixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, (iii)\nmodify the terms and conditions of any Award\ngranted to participants outside of the United\nStates to comply with foreign laws, (iv)\nestablish subplans and modify exercise\nprocedures and other terms and procedures, to\nthe extent such actions may be necessary or\nadvisable and (v) take any action that it\ndeems advisable to obtain approval or comply\nwith any necessary local government regulatory\nexemptions or approval. New Plan Benefits.\nBecause benefits under the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan will depend on the\nCompensation Committee\u0092s actions and the fair\nmarket value of the Shares at various future\ndates, it is not possible to determine the\nbenefits that will be received by directors,\nexecutive officers and other employees if the\nSixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan is\napproved by stockholders.

The\ndiscussion is intended solely for general\ninformation and does not make specific\nrepresentations to any Award recipient. A\nrecipient\u0092s particular situation may be such\nthat some variation of the basic rules is\napplicable to him or her. In addition, the\nfederal income tax laws and regulations\nfrequently have been revised and may be\nchanged again at any time. Therefore, each\nrecipient is urged to consult a tax advisor\nbefore exercising any award or before\ndisposing of any shares acquired under the\nSixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan both with\nrespect to federal income tax consequences as\nwell as any foreign, state or local tax\nconsequences. The grant of an option or SAR\nwill create no tax consequences for the\nparticipant or Capital One. A participant will\nnot generally recognize taxable income upon\nexercising an ISO (except that the alternative\nminimum tax may apply). Upon exercising an\noption other than an ISO, the participant must\ngenerally recognize ordinary income equal to\nthe excess of the fair market value of the\nfreely transferable and nonforfeitable Shares\nacquired on the date of exercise over the\nexercise price. Upon exercise of an SAR, the\nparticipant must generally recognize ordinary\nincome equal to the cash or the fair market\nvalue of the freely transferable and\nnonforfeitable Shares received. Upon a\ndisposition of Shares acquired upon exercise\nof an ISO before the end of the applicable ISO\nholding periods, the participant must\ngenerally recognize ordinary income equal to\nthe lesser of (i) the fair market value of the\nShares at the date of exercise of the ISO\nminus the exercise price, or (ii) the amount\nrealized upon the disposition of the ISO\nShares minus the exercise price. Otherwise, a\nparticipant\u0092s disposition of Shares acquired\nupon the exercise of an option (including an\nISO for which the ISO holding periods are met)\ngenerally will result in capital gain or loss\nmeasured by the excess of the sale price over\nthe participant\u0092s tax basis in such Shares\n(the tax basis generally being the exercise\nprice plus any amount previously recognized as\nordinary income in connection with the\nexercise of the option). Capital One generally\nwill be entitled to a tax deduction equal to\nthe amount recognized as ordinary income by\nthe participant in connection with an option\nor SAR. Capital One generally is not entitled\nto a tax deduction relating to amounts that\nrepresent a capital gain to a participant.\nAccordingly, Capital One will not be entitled\nto any tax deduction with respect to an ISO if\nthe participant holds the Shares in\nsatisfaction of the ISO holding periods prior\nto disposition of the Shares. With respect to\nAwards other than options and SARs involving\nthe issuance of Shares or other property that\nis restricted as to transferability and\nsubject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,\nthe participant must generally recognize\nordinary income equal to the fair market value\nof the Shares or other property received at\nthe first time the Shares or other property\nbecome transferable or no longer subject to a\nsubstantial risk of forfeiture, whichever\noccurs earlier. Under the Sixth Amended and\nRestated 2004 Plan, a participant may be\npermitted or required to elect to be taxed at\nthe time of receipt of Shares or other\nproperty rather than upon lapse of\nrestrictions on transferability or substantial\nrisk of forfeiture, but if the participant\nsubsequently forfeits such Shares or property,\nthe participant would not be entitled to any\ntax deduction, including as a capital loss,\nfor the value of the Shares or property on\nwhich he or she previously paid tax. In such\ncase, the participant must file any such\nelection with the Internal Revenue Service\nwithin thirty (30) days of the receipt of the\nShares or other property. Capital One\ngenerally will be entitled to a deduction in\nan amount equal to the ordinary income\nrecognized by the participant. With respect to\nAwards other than options and SARs granted\nunder the Sixth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan\nthat result in the payment or issuance of cash\nor Shares or other property that is either not\nrestricted as to transferability or not\nsubject to a substantial risk of forfeiture,\nthe participant must generally recognize\nordinary income equal to the cash or the fair\nmarket value of Shares or other property\nreceived. Any deferral of the time of payment\nor issuance will generally result in the\ndeferral of the time the participant will be\nliable for income taxes with respect to such\npayment or issuance. Capital One generally\nwill be entitled to a deduction in an amount\nequal to the ordinary income recognized by the\nparticipant. However, pursuant to Code Section\n162(m), compensation paid to covered executive\nofficers in excess of $1 million will\ngenerally not be deductible.\n                                              \n         CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0        2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0      \n  126    FINANCIAL\u00a0          STATEMENT        \n         CORPORATION                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  SECTION XII - APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE  \n  CAPITAL                                     \n  ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION SIXTH AMENDED     \n  AND                                         \n  RESTATED 2004 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (ITEM 4  \n  ON                                          \n  PROXY CARD)                                 \n                                              \nAwards that are granted, accelerated or\nenhanced upon the occurrence of a change of\ncontrol may give rise, in whole or in part, to\n\u0093excess parachute payments\u0094 within the meaning\nof Code Section 280G and, to such extent, will\nbe non-deductibleby Capital One and subject to\na 20% excise tax by the participant. *** The\nBoard of Directors recommends that you vote\n\u0093FOR\u0094 the proposal to approve and adopt the\nCapital One Financial Corporation Sixth\nAmended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive\nPlan.\n                                              \n  CAPITAL\u00a0ONE\u00a0       2021\u00a0PROXY\u00a0              \n  FINANCIAL\u00a0         STATEMENT           127  \n  CORPORATION                                 \n                                              \nSection XIII - Other Business\n                  \n  Other Business  \n                  \nAs of the date of this proxy statement, we\nknow of no business that will be presented for\nconsideration at the 2021 Annual Stockholder\nMeeting other than the items referred to\nabove.

In addition, these non-\nGAAPmeasures are reviewed by the Compensation\nCommittee and the other independent members of\nour Board of Directors as part of their\nassessment of the Company\u0092s performance. While\ncertain of our non-GAAPmeasures are widely\nused by investors, analysts and bank\nregulatory agencies to assess the capital\nposition of financial services companies, they\nmay not be comparable to similarly-titled\nmeasures reported by other companies. The\nfollowing tables present reconciliations of\nthese non-GAAPmeasures to the applicable\namounts measured in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 1: Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings\nPer Share
