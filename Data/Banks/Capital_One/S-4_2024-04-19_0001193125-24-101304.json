We are requesting\nthat you take certain actions as a holder of\nCapital One common stock (a \u0093Capital One\nstockholder\u0094) or as a holder of Discover\ncommon stock (a \u0093Discover stockholder\u0094). The\nboards of directors of Capital One and\nDiscover have each unanimously approved a\nmerger agreement (as defined below) pursuant\nto which Capital One will acquire Discover.\nThis acquisition will accelerate Capital One\u0092s\nability to build a global payments technology\ncompany that is competitive with the largest\npayment networks and payments companies, and\nenhance Capital One\u0092s ability to compete with\nthe nation\u0092s largest banks in the provision of\ncredit cards and banking and payment services.\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger,\ndated as of February 19, 2024, by and among\nDiscover, Capital One and Vega Merger Sub,\nInc. (\u0093Merger Sub\u0094) (as may be amended,\nmodified or supplemented from time to time in\naccordance with its terms, the \u0093merger\nagreement\u0094), Merger Sub will merge with and\ninto Discover (the \u0093first merger\u0094), with\nDiscover as the surviving corporation.\nImmediately following the first merger,\nDiscover will merge with and into Capital One\n(the \u0093second step merger,\u0094 and together with\nthe first merger, the \u0093mergers\u0094), with Capital\nOne as the surviving corporation (the\n\u0093surviving entity\u0094 or \u0093Capital One\u0094).\nImmediately following the completion of the\nsecond step merger, Discover Bank, a Delaware\nstate-chartered bank and a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Discover, will merge with and\ninto Capital One, National Association, a\nwholly owned national bank subsidiary of\nCapital One, with Capital One, National\nAssociation as the surviving bank. In the\nfirst merger, Discover stockholders will\nreceive 1.0192 shares of Capital One common\nstock for each share of Discover common stock\n(the \u0093exchange ratio\u0094) they own. Based on the\nclosing price of Capital One common stock on\nthe New York Stock Exchange (the \u0093NYSE\u0094) on\nFebruary 16, 2024, the last trading day before\nthe public announcement of the mergers, the\nexchange ratio represented approximately\n$139.86 in value for each share of Discover\ncommon stock, representing merger\nconsideration of approximately $35.3 billion\non an aggregate basis. Based on the closing\nprice of Capital One common stock on the NYSE\non [ ], 2024, the last practicable trading day\nbefore the date of the accompanying joint\nproxy statement/prospectus, of $[ ], the\nexchange ratio represented approximately $[ ]\nin value for each share of Discover common\nstock. In addition, each share of Discover\npreferred stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the second step merger\nwill be converted into the right to receive\none (1) share of an applicable newly created\nseries of new Capital One preferred stock\nhaving terms that are not materially less\nfavorable than the terms of the applicable\nseries of Discover preferred stock. Each\noutstanding Discover depositary share\nrepresenting a 1/100th interest in a share of\nDiscover preferred stock will become a new\nCapital One depositary share and will\nrepresent a 1/100th interest in a share of the\napplicable series of new Capital One preferred\nstock. Holders of Capital One common stock and\nholders of Capital One preferred stock (or\ndepositary shares in respect thereof) will\ncontinue to own their existing shares of\nCapital One common stock or Capital One\npreferred stock (or depositary shares in\nrespect thereof), as applicable, following the\nmergers.\n\nThe value of the Capital One common stock at\nthe time of completion of the mergers could be\ngreater than, less than or the same as the\nvalue of Capital One common stock on the date\nof this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We\nurge you to obtain current market quotations\nof Capital One common stock (NYSE trading\nsymbol \u0093COF\u0094) and Discover common stock (NYSE\ntrading symbol \u0093DFS\u0094).\n\nThe obligations of Capital One and Discover to\ncomplete the mergers\nare subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a\nnumber of conditions set forth in the merger\nagreement, a copy of which is attached as\nAnnex A to this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nWe expect the mergers, taken together, will\nqualify as a \u0093reorganization\u0094 within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094).\nAccordingly, Discover stockholders generally\nwill not recognize any gain or loss for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes on the exchange of\nshares of Discover common stock for Capital\nOne common\nstock in the first merger, except with respect\nto any cash received by Discover stockholders\nin lieu of fractional shares of Capital One\ncommon stock. For more information regarding\nthe tax consequences of the mergers, see the\nsection entitled\n\u0093Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nof the Mergers\u0094 beginning on page 124.\n\nBased\non the number of shares of Discover common\nstock outstanding or reserved for issuance as\nof [ ], 2024, Capital One expects to issue\napproximately [ ] million shares of Capital\nOne common stock to\nDiscover stockholders in the aggregate in the\nfirst merger. We estimate that former Capital\nOne stockholders will own approximately 60% of\nthe common stock of the surviving entity and\nformer Discover stockholders will own\napproximately 40% of the\ncommon stock of the surviving entity following\nthe completion of the mergers.\n\nThe special meeting of Discover stockholders\nwill be held\nin person on [ ], 2024 at [ ], Central Time\n(the \u0093Discover special meeting\u0094). The special\nmeeting of Capital One stockholders will be\nheld in person on [ ], 2024 at\n[ ], Eastern Time (the \u0093Capital One special\nmeeting\u0094). At our respective special meetings,\nin addition to other business, Capital One\nwill ask the Capital One stockholders to\napprove the issuance of shares of\nCapital One common stock to Discover\nstockholders pursuant to the merger agreement,\nand Discover will ask the Discover\nstockholders to adopt the merger agreement.\nInformation about these meetings and the\nmergers is contained in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nHolders of Discover preferred stock and\nholders of depositary shares representing\nDiscover preferred stock are not\nentitled to, and are not requested to, vote at\nthe Discover special meeting. Holders of\nCapital One preferred stock and holders of\ndepositary shares representing Capital One\npreferred stock are not entitled to, and are\nnot requested to, vote at the\nCapital One special meeting.\n\nEach of our boards of directors unanimously\nrecommends that the Capital One stockholders\nand the Discover stockholders vote \u0093FOR\u0094 each\nof the proposals to be considered at their\nrespective special meetings. We strongly\nsupport the mergers and join our boards in\ntheir recommendations.\n\nThis joint proxy statement/prospectus provides\nyou with detailed information about the merger\nagreement and the mergers. It also contains or\nreferences information about Capital One and\nDiscover and certain related matters. You are\nencouraged to read this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus carefully in its\nentirety.

You should read and carefully      \n      consider the risk factors set forth in  \n      the section entitled \u0093Risk               \n      Factors\u0094 beginning on page 30. You also  \n  A:  should read and carefully consider the  \n      risk factors of Capital One and         \n      Discover contained in the documents     \n      that are incorporated by reference      \n      into this joint proxy                   \n      statement/prospectus.                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      What are the material U.S. federal      \n  Q:  income tax consequences of the mergers  \n      to Discover stockholders and            \n      holders of Discover preferred stock?    \n                                              \n                                              \n      The mergers, taken together, are        \n      intended to qualify as a                \n      \u0093reorganization\u0094 for U.S. federal income  \n      tax purposes, and it is a condition to  \n      our respective obligations to complete  \n      the first merger that each of Capital   \n      One and Discover receives a legal       \n      opinion to the effect that the          \n      mergers, taken together, will so        \n      qualify. Accordingly, Discover          \n      stockholders and holders of Discover    \n      preferred stock generally will not      \n      recognize any gain or loss for U.S.     \n      federal income tax purposes on the      \n      exchange of Discover common stock for   \n      Capital One common stock or Discover    \n      preferred stock for new Capital         \n      One preferred stock, as applicable, in  \n      the first merger or the second step     \n      merger, as applicable, except for any   \n  A:  gain or loss that may result from the   \n      receipt of cash by Discover             \n      stockholders instead of a fractional    \n      share of Capital One common             \n      stock. You should be aware that the     \n      tax consequences to you of the mergers  \n      may depend upon your own situation. In  \n      addition, you may be subject to state,  \n      local or foreign tax laws that are not  \n      discussed in this joint proxy           \n      statement/prospectus. You               \n      should therefore consult with your own  \n      tax advisor for a full understanding    \n      of the tax consequences to you of the   \n      mergers. For a more complete            \n      discussion of the material U.S.         \n      federal income tax consequences of the  \n      mergers, see the section entitled       \n      \u0093Material U.S. Federal Income Tax        \n      Consequences of the Mergers\u0094 beginning   \n      on page 124.                            \n                                              \n                                              \n  Q:  When are the mergers expected to be     \n      completed?                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      Capital One and Discover expect the     \n      mergers to close in late 2024 or early  \n      2025. However, neither Capital One      \n      nor Discover can predict the actual     \n      date on which the mergers will be       \n      completed, or if the mergers will be    \n      completed at all, because completion    \n      is subject to conditions and factors    \n      outside the control of both companies.  \n      Discover must first obtain              \n      the requisite Discover stockholder      \n      approval, and Capital One must first    \n      obtain the requisite Capital One        \n  A:  stockholder approval. Capital One and   \n      Discover must also obtain necessary     \n      regulatory approvals and satisfy        \n      certain other closing conditions.       \n      Capital One and Discover expect the     \n      first merger to be completed promptly   \n      once Capital One and Discover have      \n      obtained their respective stockholders\u0092  \n      approvals noted above, have obtained    \n      necessary regulatory approvals, and     \n      have satisfied certain                  \n      other closing conditions, and the       \n      second step merger to be completed      \n      immediately following the completion    \n      of the first merger.                    \n                                              \n12\n                                              \n  Q:  What are the conditions to complete     \n      the first merger?                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      The obligations of Capital One and      \n      Discover to complete the first merger   \n      are subject to the satisfaction or      \n      waiver of certain closing conditions    \n      contained in the merger agreement,      \n      including the receipt of requisite      \n      regulatory approvals (as defined in     \n      the section entitled \u0093The                \n      Mergers\u0097Regulatory Approvals\u0094 beginning   \n      on page                                 \n      95) and the expiration or termination   \n  A:  of all statutory waiting periods in     \n      respect thereof without the imposition  \n      of any materially burdensome            \n      regulatory condition, the receipt of    \n      certain tax opinions, the receipt of    \n      the requisite Capital One stockholder   \n      approval and the receipt of the         \n      requisite Discover stockholder          \n      approval.

These interests and\narrangements include rights to severance,\npotential vesting of Discover equity awards\nand rights to indemnification, and may create\npotential conflicts of interest. The Discover\nboard of directors was aware of these\nrespective interests and considered these\ninterests, among other matters,\nwhen making their decisions to approve the\nmerger agreement, and in recommending that\nDiscover stockholders vote to approve the\nDiscover merger proposal, the Discover\ncompensation proposal, and the Discover\nadjournment proposal. For more\ninformation, see the section entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Background of the Mergers\u0094 beginning\non page 54 and the section entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Discover\u0092s Reasons for the Mergers;\nRecommendation of the Discover Board of\nDirectors\u0094 beginning on page 63. These\ninterests are described in more detail below,\nand certain of them are quantified in the\nnarrative and in the section entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Interests of Discover\u0092s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Mergers\u0094 beginning\non page 87.\n\nGovernance of Capital One after the Mergers (\npage 94)\n\nAt the effective time, the board of directors\nof Capital One will be increased by three (3)\ndirectors for a total of fifteen\n(15) directors, and three (3) current\ndirectors of Discover, as determined by\nmutual agreement of Discover and Capital One,\nwill be appointed to the Capital One board of\ndirectors.\n\n21\n\nRegulatory Approvals ( page 95) Subject to\nthe terms of the merger agreement, Capital\nOne and Discover have agreed to cooperate\nwith each other and use reasonable best\nefforts to promptly prepare and file all\nnecessary documentation to effect all\napplications, notices, petitions and filings\n(and in the case of the applications,\nnotices, petitions and filings in respect of\nthe requisite regulatory approvals (as\ndefined in the section entitled \u0093 The\nMergers\u0097Regulatory Approvals\u0094 beginning on\npage 95), use their reasonable best efforts\nto make such filings within thirty (30) days\nof the date of the merger agreement), to\nobtain as promptly as practicable all\npermits, consents, approvals and\nauthorizations of all third parties and\ngovernmental entities which are necessary or\nadvisable to consummate the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement\n(including the mergers and the bank merger),\nto comply with the terms and conditions of\nall such permits, consents, approvals and\nauthorizations of all such governmental\nentities, and to contest, defend and appeal\nany action or proceeding by a governmental\nentity (other than a bank regulatory agency),\nwhether judicial or administrative,\nchallenging the merger agreement or the\nconsummation of the mergers and the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement. These approvals include, among\nothers, the approval of the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (the\n\u0093Federal Reserve Board\u0094) and the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (the \u0093OCC\u0094).\nThe initial submission of these regulatory\napplications occurred on or about March 20,\n2024. Additional notifications and/or\napplications requesting approval may be\nsubmitted to various other federal, state and\nnon-U.S.regulatory authorities and self-\nregulatory organizations. Although neither\nCapital One nor Discover knows of any reason\nwhy it cannot obtain these regulatory\napprovals in a timely manner, Capital One and\nDiscover cannot be certain when or if they\nwill be obtained, or that the granting of\nthese regulatory approvals will not involve\nthe imposition of conditions on the\ncompletion of the mergers or the bank merger,\nincluding conditions that would reasonably be\nexpected to have a material adverse effect on\nthe surviving entity and its subsidiaries,\ntaken as a whole, after giving effect to the\nmergers. Expected Timing of the Mergers\nCapital One and Discover expect the mergers\nto close in late 2024 or early 2025. However,\nneither Capital One nor Discover can predict\nthe actual date on which the mergers will be\ncompleted, or if the mergers will be\ncompleted at all, because completion is\nsubject to conditions and factors outside the\ncontrol of both companies. Discover must\nfirst obtain the approval of Discover\nstockholders for the Discover merger\nproposal, and Capital One must first obtain\nthe approval of Capital One stockholders for\nthe Capital One share issuance proposal.\nCapital One and Discover must also obtain\nnecessary regulatory approvals and satisfy\ncertain other closing conditions. Capital One\nand Discover expect the first merger to be\ncompleted promptly once Capital One and\nDiscover have obtained their respective\nstockholders\u0092 approvals noted above, have\nobtained necessary regulatory approvals, and\nhave satisfied the other closing conditions,\nand the second step merger to be completed\nimmediately following the completion of the\nfirst merger. Conditions to Complete the\nFirst Merger ( page 119) As more fully\ndescribed in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus and in the merger\nagreement, the completion of the first merger\ndepends on a number of conditions being\nsatisfied or, where legally permissible,\nwaived.

You are cautioned not to place\nundue reliance on the forward-looking\nstatements, which speak only as of the date of\nthis joint proxy statement/prospectus or the\ndates of the documents incorporated by\nreference in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. Annualized, pro forma,\nprojected and estimated numbers are used for\nillustrative purposes only, are not forecasts\nand may not reflect actual results. Except as\nrequired by applicable law, neither Capital\nOne nor Discover undertakes to update these\nforward-looking statements to reflect facts,\ncircumstances, assumptions or events that\noccur after the date the forward-looking\nstatements are made. 28\n\nFor additional information about factors that\ncould cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those described in the\nforward-looking statements, please see the\nreports that Capital One and Discover have\nfiled with the SEC as described in the section\nentitled \u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094\nbeginning on page 189.\n\nCapital One and Discover expressly qualify in\ntheir entirety all forward-looking statements\nattributable to either of them or\nany person acting on their behalf by the\ncautionary statements contained in, referred\nto, or incorporated in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\n29\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nAn investment by Discover\u0092s stockholders in\nCapital One common stock as a result of the\nexchange of shares of Discover common stock\nfor shares of Capital One common stock in the\nfirst merger involves certain risks.\nSimilarly, a decision on the part of Capital\nOne stockholders to approve the Capital One\nshare issuance also involves risks for Capital\nOne stockholders, who will continue to hold\ntheir shares of Capital One common stock after\nthe mergers. Certain material risks and\nuncertainties connected with the merger\nagreement and transactions contemplated\nthereby, including the mergers and bank\nmerger, and ownership of Capital One common\nstock, are discussed below. In addition,\nCapital One and Discover have discussed\ncertain other material risks connected with\nthe ownership of Capital One common stock and\nwith Capital One\u0092s business, and with the\nownership of Discover common stock and\nDiscover\u0092s business, respectively, under the\ncaption \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 appearing in their\nAnnual Reports on Form 10-Kmost recently filed\nwith the SEC, and may include additional or\nupdated disclosures of such material risks in\ntheir subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form\n10-Qand Current Reports on Form 8-Kthat each\nhas filed with the SEC or may file with the\nSEC after the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. See the section entitled\n\u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094\nbeginning on page 189.\n\nCapital One stockholders and Discover\nstockholders should carefully read and\nconsider all of these risks and all other\ninformation contained in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, including the\ndiscussions of risk factors included in the\ndocuments incorporated by reference in this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus, in deciding\nwhether to vote for approval of the various\nproposals for which they may be entitled to\nvote at the Capital One special meeting or the\nDiscover special meeting. The risks described\nin this joint proxy statement/prospectus and\nin those documents incorporated by reference\nmay adversely affect the value of Capital One\ncommon stock that you, as an existing Capital\nOne stockholder, currently hold or that you,\nas an existing Discover stockholder, will hold\nupon consummation of the mergers, and could\nresult in a significant decline in the value\nof Capital One common stock and cause Capital\nOne stockholders and/or Discover stockholders\nto lose all or part of the value of their\nrespective investments in Capital One common\nstock.\n\nRisks Relating to the Consummation of the\nMergers and Capital One Following the Mergers\n\nBecause the market price of Capital One common\nstock may fluctuate prior to the effective\ntime, including as a result of Capital One\u0092s\nand Discover\u0092s financial performance prior to\nthe effective time, stockholders cannot be\ncertain of the market value of the merger\nconsideration to be received by Discover\nstockholders.\n\nIn the first merger, each share of Discover\ncommon stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the effective time\n(except for shares\nowned by Discover or Capital One, subject to\ncertain exceptions set forth in the merger\nagreement), will be converted into the right\nto receive 1.0192 shares of Capital One common\nstock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will\nnot be adjusted for\nchanges in the market price of either Capital\nOne common stock or Discover common stock.\nChanges in the price of Capital One common\nstock between now and the effective time will\naffect the value of the merger consideration\nthat Discover stockholders\nwill receive in the first merger. Neither\nCapital One nor Discover is permitted to\nterminate the merger agreement as a result of\nany increase or decrease in the market price\nof Capital One common stock or Discover common\nstock.\n\nStock price changes may result from a variety\nof factors, including general market and\neconomic conditions, changes in Capital One\u0092s\nand\nDiscover\u0092s businesses, operations and\nprospects, the performance of peer companies\nand other financial companies, volatility in\nthe prices of securities in global financial\nmarkets, including market prices of Capital\nOne, Discover and other\nbanking companies, and regulatory\nconsiderations and tax laws, many of which are\nbeyond Capital One\u0092s and Discover\u0092s control.\nTherefore, at the time of the Capital One\nspecial meeting and the Discover special\nmeeting, Capital One\nstockholders and Discover stockholders will\nnot know the market value of the merger\nconsideration that Discover stockholders will\nreceive at the effective time. You should\nobtain current market quotations for shares of\nCapital One common stock\n(NYSE: COF) and for shares of Discover common\nstock (NYSE: DFS).\n\n30\n\nThe market price of Capital One common stock\nafter the mergers may be affected by factors\ndifferent from those currently affecting the\nshares of Capital One common stock or Discover\ncommon stock.\n\nAs a result of the first merger,\nDiscover stockholders will become Capital One\nstockholders. Capital One\u0092s business differs\nfrom that of Discover and certain adjustments\nmay be made to Capital One\u0092s business as a\nresult of the mergers. Accordingly, the\nresults of\noperations of Capital One and the market price\nof Capital One common stock after the\ncompletion of the mergers may be affected by\nfactors different from those currently\naffecting the independent results of\noperations of each of Capital One and\nDiscover. For a discussion of the businesses\nof Capital One and Discover and of certain\nfactors to consider in connection with those\nbusinesses, see the documents incorporated by\nreference in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus and listed in the\nsection entitled \u0093Where You Can Find More\nInformation\u0094 beginning on page 189.\n\nCapital One and Discover are expected to incur\nsubstantial costs related to the mergers and\nintegration, and these costs may be greater\nthan anticipated due to unexpected events.\n\nCapital One and Discover have incurred and\nexpect to incur a number of significant non-\nrecurring costs\nassociated with the mergers. These costs\ninclude legal, financial advisory, accounting,\nconsulting and other advisory fees,\nseverance/employee benefit-related costs,\npublic company filing fees and other\nregulatory fees, financial printing and other\nprinting costs and other related costs. Some\nof these costs are payable by either Capital\nOne or Discover regardless of whether the\nmergers are completed.\n\nIn addition, Capital One will incur\nintegration costs following the completion of\nthe mergers as Capital One and Discover\nintegrate their\nbusinesses, including facilities and systems\nconsolidation costs and employment-related\ncosts. Discover may also incur additional\ncosts to maintain employee morale and to\nretain key employees. There are a large number\nof processes, policies,\nprocedures, operations, technologies and\nsystems that may need to be integrated,\nincluding purchasing, accounting and finance,\npayroll, compliance, treasury management,\nbranch operations, vendor management, risk\nmanagement, lines of business,\npricing and benefits. While Capital One and\nDiscover have assumed that a certain level of\ncosts will be incurred, there are many factors\nbeyond their control that could affect the\ntotal amount or the timing of the integration\ncosts. Moreover, many\nof the costs that will be incurred are, by\ntheir nature, difficult to estimate\naccurately. These integration costs may result\nin Capital One taking charges, which may be\nsubstantial, against earnings following the\ncompletion of the mergers, and the\namount and timing of such charges are\nuncertain at present. There can be no\nassurances that the expected benefits and\nefficiencies related to the integration of the\nbusinesses will be realized to offset these\ntransaction and integration costs over\ntime.\n\nIntegrating Discover\u0092s business into Capital\nOne may be more difficult, costly or time-\nconsuming than expected, and Capital One may\nfail to realize the anticipated benefits of\nthe mergers.\n\nThe success of the mergers will depend, in\npart, on the ability to realize the\nanticipated revenue synergies and cost savings\nfrom combining the businesses of Capital One\nand Discover. To realize the anticipated\nbenefits from the mergers, including revenue\nsynergies and cost savings, Capital One must\nsuccessfully integrate\nDiscover into its existing businesses and, in\nparticular, integrate Discover into its risk\nmanagement framework, compliance systems and\ncorporate culture, in a manner that permits\nthe anticipated revenue synergies and cost\nsavings to be realized and\nthat does not materially disrupt existing\ncustomer relationships or result in decreased\nrevenues due to loss of customers. If Capital\nOne is not able to successfully achieve these\nobjectives for any reason, including changes\nin laws or regulations\nthat prevent Capital One from realizing\nrevenue synergies, the anticipated benefits of\nthe mergers may not be realized fully or at\nall or may take longer to realize than\nexpected. In addition, the actual cost savings\nof the mergers could be less\nthan anticipated, and integration may result\nin additional and unforeseen expenses.\n\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the\nanticipated benefits of the mergers and the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, as well as any delays encountered\nin the integration process, could have\n\n31\n\nan adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of\nexpenses and operating results of Capital One\nfollowing the completion of the mergers, which\nmay adversely affect the value of the common\nstock of\nCapital One following the completion of the\nmergers.\n\nCapital One and Discover have operated and,\nuntil the effective time, must continue\nto operate, independently. It is possible that\nthe integration process could result in the\nloss of key Discover employees, the disruption\nof each company\u0092s ongoing businesses or\ninconsistencies in standards, controls,\nprocedures and policies\nthat adversely affect the companies\u0092 ability\nto maintain relationships with clients,\ncustomers, depositors and employees or to\nachieve the anticipated benefits of the\nmergers, including revenue synergies and cost\nsavings. Integration efforts\nbetween the companies may also divert\nmanagement attention and resources. These\nintegration matters could have an adverse\neffect on Capital One and Discover during this\ntransition period and on Capital One for an\nundetermined period after completion\nof the mergers.\n\nThe future results of Capital One following\nthe completion of the mergers may suffer if\nCapital One does not effectively manage its\nexpanded operations.\n\nFollowing the mergers, the size and scope of\nthe business of Capital One will increase\nsignificantly beyond\nthe current size and scope of either Capital\nOne\u0092s or Discover\u0092s business. Capital One\u0092s\nfuture success following the mergers will\ndepend, in part, upon its ability to manage\nits expanded businesses, which will pose\nsubstantial\nchallenges for management, including\nchallenges related to the management and\nmonitoring of new operations and associated\nincreased costs and complexity. There can be\nno assurances that Capital One will be\nsuccessful or that it will realize the\nexpected operating efficiencies, cost savings\nand other benefits currently anticipated from\nthe mergers.\n\nIn addition, following the\nmergers, Capital One may be subject to\nincreased scrutiny by, and/or additional\nregulatory requirements of, governmental\nauthorities as a result of the transaction or\nthe size, scope and complexity of its business\noperations, which may have an\nadverse effect on the business, operations or\nstock price of Capital One.\n\nCapital One may be unable to retain Discover\npersonnel successfully after the completion of\nthe mergers.\n\nThe success of the mergers will depend in part\non Capital One\u0092s ability to retain the talent\nand dedication of key employees currently\nemployed by Discover. It is possible that\nthese employees may decide not to remain with\nDiscover while the mergers are pending or with\nCapital One after the completion of the\nmergers. If Capital One and\nDiscover are unable to retain key employees,\nincluding management, who are critical to the\nsuccessful integration and future operations\nof the companies, Capital One and Discover\ncould face disruptions in their operations,\nloss of existing\ncustomers, loss of key information, expertise\nor know-how and unanticipated additional\nrecruitment costs. In addition, following the\ncompletion of the mergers, if key employees\nterminate their employment,\nCapital One\u0092s business activities may be\nadversely affected, and management\u0092s attention\nmay be diverted to successfully hiring\nsuitable replacements, all of which may cause\nCapital One\u0092s business to suffer. Discover\nalso may not be\nable to locate or retain suitable replacements\nfor any key employees who leave its company.\n\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may\ntake longer than expected, or may impose\nconditions that are not presently anticipated\nor that could have an adverse effect on\nCapital One following the mergers.\n\nBefore the mergers and the bank merger may be\ncompleted, various approvals, consents and\nnon-objections\nmust be obtained from the Federal Reserve\nBoard, the OCC and other regulatory\nauthorities. In determining whether to grant\nthese approvals, the regulators consider a\nvariety of factors, including the regulatory\nstanding of each party and the factors\ndescribed in the section entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Regulatory Approvals\u0094 beginning on\npage 95. These approvals could be delayed or\nnot obtained at all, including due to any or\nall of the following: an adverse\ndevelopment in either party\u0092s regulatory\nstanding, or any other factors considered by\nregulators in\n\n32\n\ngranting such approvals; governmental,\npolitical or community group inquiries,\ninvestigations or opposition; changes in\nlegislation; or adverse developments in the\npolitical environment.\n\nEven if those approvals are granted, they may\nimpose terms and conditions, limitations,\nobligations or costs, or place restrictions on\nthe\nconduct of Capital One\u0092s business following\nthe mergers or require changes to the terms of\nthe transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement. Any such terms and conditions,\nlimitations, obligations or restrictions could\ndelay the completion\nof the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, result in additional material costs\non or materially limit the revenues of Capital\nOne following the mergers or otherwise reduce\nthe anticipated benefits of the mergers or\neven result in the\nabandonment of the mergers. Additionally, the\ncompletion of the first merger is conditioned\non the absence of certain orders, injunctions\nor decrees by any governmental entity of\ncompetent jurisdiction that would prohibit or\nmake illegal the\ncompletion of any of the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement.\n\nDespite the parties\u0092 commitments to use their\nreasonable\nbest efforts to respond to any request for\ninformation and resolve any objection that may\nbe asserted by any governmental entity with\nrespect to the merger agreement, neither\nCapital One nor Discover nor any of their\nrespective subsidiaries is\nrequired under the terms of the merger\nagreement to take any action, or commit to\ntake any action, or agree to any condition or\nrestriction in connection with obtaining\npermits, consents, approvals and\nauthorizations of governmental entities that\nwould reasonably be expected to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the surviving\nentity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,\nafter giving effect to the mergers. See the\nsection entitled \u0093The Mergers\u0097Regulatory\nApprovals\u0094\nbeginning on page 95.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information included in this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus is preliminary and\nthe actual value of the consideration to be\nissued in the mergers as well as the actual\nfinancial condition and results of operations\nof Capital One after the mergers may differ\nmaterially.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus is presented for\nillustrative\npurposes only and is not necessarily\nindicative of what Capital One\u0092s actual\nfinancial condition or results of operations\nwould have been had the mergers been completed\non the dates indicated. The unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined\nfinancial information reflects adjustments,\nwhich are based upon preliminary estimates, to\nrecord the Discover identifiable assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed at fair value\nand the resulting goodwill recognized. The\nfair value estimates\nreflected in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus are preliminary, and the\nfinal amounts will be based upon the actual\nconsideration paid and the fair value of the\nassets and liabilities of Discover as of the\nclosing date. Accordingly, (i) the\nactual value of the consideration paid and the\nfair value of such assets and liabilities may\nvary significantly from the value used in\npreparing the unaudited pro forma combined\nconsolidated financial information in this\njoint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, and (ii) the final\nacquisition accounting adjustments may differ\nmaterially from the pro forma adjustments\nreflected in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus.\n\nThe prospective financial information is based\non various assumptions and may not be\nrealized.\n\nWhile presented with numeric specificity, the\nCapital One and Discover prospective financial\ninformation provided in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus is based on numerous\nvariables and assumptions (including, but not\nlimited to, those related to the banking,\ncredit card and payment services industries,\neconomic, market and financial conditions and\nadditional matters specific\nto Capital One\u0092s or Discover\u0092s businesses, as\napplicable) that are inherently subjective and\nuncertain and are outside the control of\nCapital One and Discover. As a result, actual\nresults may differ materially from the\nprospective\nfinancial information. Important factors that\nmay affect actual results and cause the\nprospective financial information to not be\nachieved include, but are not limited to,\nrisks and uncertainties relating to Capital\nOne\u0092s and Discover\u0092s\nbusinesses, as applicable (including each\ncompany\u0092s ability to achieve strategic goals,\nobjectives and targets over applicable\nperiods), liabilities that may be greater than\nanticipated, industry performance, general\nbusiness and economic\nconditions. For more information, see the\nsection entitled \u0093The Mergers\u0097Certain\nUnaudited Prospective Financial Information\u0094\nbeginning on page 82.\n\n33\n\nThe opinion delivered by Centerview to the\nCapital One board of directors and the opinion\ndelivered by PJT Partners to the Discover\nboard of directors, respectively, prior to the\nentry into the merger agreement will not\nreflect changes in circumstances that may have\noccurred since the date of the opinions.\n\nThe written opinion of Centerview, Capital\nOne\u0092s financial advisor, to the Capital One\nboard of directors, was delivered on and dated\nFebruary 19, 2024, and the written opinion of\nPJT Partners, Discover\u0092s financial advisor, to\nthe Discover board of directors was delivered\non and dated February 19, 2024. Changes in the\noperations and prospects of Capital One or\nDiscover, general market and economic\nconditions and other factors which may be\nbeyond the control of Capital One and Discover\nand the market prices of Capital One and\nDiscover, may have altered the value of\nCapital One or Discover or the prices of\nshares of Capital One common stock and\nDiscover common stock as of the date of this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus, or may alter\nsuch values and prices by the effective time.\nThe opinions do not speak as of the date of\nthis joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus or as of any other date\nsubsequent to the dates of those opinions.\n\nDiscover\u0092s directors and executive officers\nmay have interests in the mergers that may\ndiffer from, or are in addition to, the\ninterests of Discover stockholders generally.\n\nDiscover\nstockholders should be aware that Discover\u0092s\ndirectors and executive officers may have\ninterests in the mergers and have arrangements\nthat are different from, or in addition to,\nthose of Discover stockholders. These\ninterests and arrangements\nmay create potential conflicts of interest.\nThe Discover board of directors was aware of\nthese respective interests and considered\nthese interests, among other matters, when\nmaking their decisions to approve the merger\nagreement, and in recommending\nthat Discover stockholders vote to approve the\nDiscover merger proposal, the Discover\ncompensation proposal, and the Discover\nadjournment proposal. For a more complete\ndescription of the interests of Discover\u0092s\ndirectors and executive officers\nin the mergers, see the section entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Interests of Discover\u0092s Directors and\nExecutive Officers in the Mergers\u0094 beginning\non page 87.\n\nIf the requisite approval of Capital One\nstockholders or Discover stockholders is not\nobtained, or other conditions to the closing\nof the first merger are not met, the merger\nagreement may be terminated in accordance with\nits terms and the mergers may not be\ncompleted.\n\nThe merger\nagreement is subject to a number of conditions\nwhich must be fulfilled in order to complete\nthe first merger. Those conditions include:\n(i) approval of the Capital One share issuance\nproposal by the requisite Capital One vote,\nand approval of\nthe Discover merger proposal by the requisite\nDiscover vote; (ii) the shares of Capital One\ncommon stock issuable pursuant to the merger\nagreement having been authorized for listing\non the NYSE, subject to official notice of\nissuance;\n(iii) all requisite regulatory approvals\nhaving been obtained and remaining in full\nforce and effect and all statutory waiting\nperiods in respect thereof having expired or\nbeen terminated, and no such requisite\nregulatory approval having\nresulted in the imposition of any materially\nburdensome regulatory condition; (iv)\neffectiveness of the registration statement on\nForm S-4 of which this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus forms a part; and\n(v) the absence of any order, injunction or\ndecree issued by any court or governmental\nentity of competent jurisdiction or other\nlegal restraint or prohibition preventing the\nconsummation of the mergers, the bank merger\nor any of the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, and the absence of the enactment of\nany law, statute, rule, regulation, order,\ninjunction or decree by any governmental\nentity which prohibits or makes illegal\nconsummation of the mergers, the bank\nmerger or any of the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement. Each\nparty\u0092s obligation to complete the first\nmerger is also subject to certain additional\ncustomary conditions, including (a) subject to\napplicable materiality\nstandards, the accuracy of the representations\nand warranties of the other party, (b) the\nperformance in all material respects by the\nother party of its obligations under the\nmerger agreement and (c) the receipt by each\nparty of an opinion\nfrom its counsel to the effect that the\nmergers, taken together, will qualify as a\n\u0093reorganization\u0094 within the meaning of Section\n368(a) of the Code. See the section entitled\n\u0093The Merger Agreement\u0097Conditions to Complete\nthe First Merger\u0094 beginning on page 119.\n\n34\n\nThese conditions to the closing of the first\nmerger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner\nor at all, and accordingly, the mergers may\nnot be completed. In addition, the parties can\nmutually decide to terminate the merger\nagreement at any time, before or after the\nrequisite Capital One stockholder approval and\nthe requisite Discover\nstockholder approval, or Capital One or\nDiscover may elect to terminate the merger\nagreement in certain other circumstances (as\nfurther described in the section entitled \u0093The\nMerger Agreement\u0097Termination of the Merger\nAgreement\u0094 beginning on page 120).\n\nFailure to complete the mergers could\nnegatively impact Capital One or Discover.\n\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of\nconditions that must be fulfilled in order to\ncomplete the mergers. Those\nconditions are described in the section\nentitled \u0093The Merger Agreement\u0097Conditions to\nComplete the First Merger\u0094 beginning on page\n119. These conditions may not be fulfilled in\na timely manner or at all,\nand, accordingly, the mergers may be delayed\nor may not be completed. In addition, if the\nmerger is not completed by February 19, 2025\n(which date may be automatically extended to\nMay 19, 2025 in certain circumstances for\npurposes of\nobtaining requisite regulatory approvals (as\nfurther described in the section entitled \u0093The\nMerger Agreement\u0097Termination of the Merger\nAgreement\u0094 beginning on page 120)), either\nCapital One or Discover\nmay choose not to proceed with the merger, and\nthe parties can mutually decide to terminate\nthe merger agreement at any time before or\nafter the requisite Capital One stockholder\napproval or the requisite Discover stockholder\napproval.\n\nIf the mergers are not completed for any\nreason, there may be various adverse\nconsequences and Capital One and/or Discover\nmay experience\nnegative reactions from the financial markets\nand from their respective customers and\nemployees. For example, Capital One\u0092s or\nDiscover\u0092s businesses may have been affected\nadversely by the failure to pursue other\nbeneficial opportunities\ndue to the focus of management on the mergers,\nwithout realizing any of the anticipated\nbenefits of completing the mergers.\nAdditionally, if the merger agreement is\nterminated, the market price of Capital One\ncommon stock or Discover common stock\ncould decline to the extent that the current\nmarket prices reflect a market assumption that\nthe mergers will be completed. If the merger\nagreement is terminated under certain\ncircumstances involving alternative\nacquisition proposals or changes in\nthe Capital One board recommendation or the\nDiscover board recommendation, either Capital\nOne or Discover may be required to pay a\ntermination fee of $1.38 billion to the other\nparty. See the section entitled \u0093The Merger\nAgreement\u0097Termination Fee\u0094 beginning on page\n121.\n\nFurther, Capital One and Discover have\nincurred\nand will incur substantial expenses in\nconnection with the negotiation and completion\nof the transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement and those expenses must be paid even\nif the mergers are not completed and neither\nparty realizes the\nexpected benefits of the mergers.\n\nIn connection with the mergers, Capital One\nwill assume Discover\u0092s outstanding debt\nobligations, and Capital One\u0092s level of\nindebtedness following the completion of the\nmergers could adversely affect Capital One\u0092s\nability to raise additional capital and to\nmeet its obligations under Capital One\u0092s\nexisting indebtedness following the mergers.\n\nIn connection with the mergers, Capital One\nwill assume Discover\u0092s outstanding\nindebtedness. Discover\u0092s existing debt,\ntogether with any future incurrence of\nadditional indebtedness, could have important\nconsequences for the surviving entity\u0092s\ncreditors and the surviving entity\u0092s\nstockholders. For example, it could limit the\nsurviving entity\u0092s ability\nto obtain additional financing for working\ncapital, capital expenditures, debt service\nrequirements, acquisitions and general\ncorporate or other purposes and require a\nsubstantial portion of cash flow from\noperations to be dedicated to the payment\nof principal and interest on the surviving\nentity\u0092s indebtedness, thereby reducing the\nsurviving entity\u0092s ability to use cash flows\nto fund its operations, capital expenditures\nand future business opportunities.\n\n35\n\nCapital One stockholders and Discover\nstockholders will have a reduced ownership and\nvoting interest in Capital One after the\nmergers and will exercise less influence over\nmanagement.\n\nCapital One stockholders and Discover\nstockholders currently have the right to vote\nin the election of the board of directors and\non other matters affecting Capital One and\nDiscover, respectively. In connection with the\nmergers, each Discover stockholder who\nreceives shares of Capital\nOne common stock will become a Capital One\nstockholder, with a percentage ownership of\nCapital One that is smaller than the holder\u0092s\ncurrent percentage ownership of Discover and\nsimilarly due to the issuance of shares of\nCapital One common\nstock to Discover stockholders in connection\nwith the mergers, each Capital One\nstockholder\u0092s percentage ownership will be\nsmaller than the holder\u0092s current percentage\nownership of Capital One. Based on the number\nof shares of Capital One\nand Discover common stock outstanding as of\nthe close of business on the respective record\ndates, and based on the number of shares of\nCapital One common stock expected to be issued\nin the mergers, the former Discover\nstockholders, as a group, are\nestimated to own approximately [ ]% of the\nfully diluted shares of Capital One\nimmediately after the mergers and current\nCapital One stockholders as a group are\nestimated to own approximately [ ]% of the\nfully diluted\nshares of Capital One immediately after the\nmergers. Because of this, Discover\nstockholders may have less influence on the\nmanagement and policies of Capital One than\nthey now have on the management and policies\nof Discover, and Capital One\nstockholders may have less influence on the\nmanagement and policies of Capital One\nfollowing the mergers than they now have on\nthe management and policies of Capital One.\n\nWhile the mergers are pending, Capital One and\nDiscover will be subject to business\nuncertainties and contractual restrictions\nthat could adversely affect each company\u0092s\nrespective business and operations.\n\nUncertainty about the effect of the\ntransaction on employees,\ncustomers, suppliers and other persons with\nwhom Capital One or Discover have a business\nrelationship may have an adverse effect on\nCapital One\u0092s and Discover\u0092s respective\nbusinesses, operations and stock prices.\nExisting customers,\nsuppliers and other business partners of\nCapital One and Discover could decide to no\nlonger do business with Capital One, Discover\nor the surviving entity, reducing the\nanticipated benefits of the mergers. Capital\nOne and Discover are also subject\nto certain restrictions on the conduct of\ntheir respective businesses while the mergers\nare pending. As a result, certain other\nprojects may be delayed or abandoned and\nbusiness decisions could be deferred. In\naddition, uncertainty may impair\nDiscover\u0092s ability to attract, retain and\nmotivate key personnel until the mergers are\ncompleted. Employee retention at Discover may\nbe challenging before completion of the\nmergers, as certain employees may experience\nuncertainty about their\nfuture roles with Capital One following the\nmergers, and these retention challenges will\nrequire Discover to incur additional expenses\nin order to retain key employees. If key\nemployees depart because of issues relating to\nthe uncertainty and\ndifficulty of integration or a desire not to\nremain with Discover or Capital One following\nthe mergers, the benefits of the mergers could\nbe materially diminished.\n\nThe merger agreement limits Capital One\u0092s and\nDiscover\u0092s respective abilities to pursue\nalternatives to the mergers and may discourage\nother companies from trying to acquire Capital\nOne or Discover.\n\nThe merger agreement contains \u0093no shop\u0094\ncovenants that\nrestrict each of Capital One\u0092s and Discover\u0092s\nability to, directly or indirectly, initiate,\nsolicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly\nfacilitate inquiries or proposals with respect\nto, engage or participate in any negotiations\nwith any\nperson concerning, provide any confidential or\nnonpublic information or data to, or have or\nparticipate in any discussions with, any\nperson relating to, any acquisition proposal,\nsubject to certain exceptions, or, unless the\nmerger agreement has\nbeen terminated in accordance with its terms,\napprove or enter into any term sheet, letter\nof intent, commitment, memorandum of\nunderstanding, agreement in principle,\nacquisition agreement, merger agreement or\nother agreement (whether written or\noral, binding or nonbinding) in connection\nwith or relating to any acquisition proposal.\n\nThe merger agreement further provides that,\nduring the twelve (12)-month period following\nthe termination of the merger agreement under\nspecified circumstances, including the entry\ninto a definitive agreement or\n\n36\n\nconsummation of a transaction with respect to\nan alternative acquisition proposal, Capital\nOne or Discover may be required to pay to the\nother party a cash termination fee equal to\n$1.38 billion. See the section entitled\n\u0093TheMerger Agreement\u0097Termination Fee\u0094\nbeginning on page 121.\n\nThese provisions could discourage a potential\nthird-party acquirer that might have an\ninterest in acquiring all or a significant\nportion of\nCapital One or Discover from considering or\nproposing that acquisition.\n\nThe shares of Capital One common stock to be\nreceived by Discover stockholders as a result\nof the first merger will have different rights\nfrom the shares of Discover common stock.\n\nIn the first\nmerger, Discover stockholders will become\nCapital One stockholders and, although their\nrights as stockholders will continue to be\ngoverned by Delaware law, they will also be\ngoverned by the organizational documents of\nCapital One, which are\ndifferent from Discover\u0092s. The rights\nassociated with Capital One common stock are\ndifferent from the rights associated with\nDiscover common stock. See the section\nentitled \u0093Comparison of the Rights of Capital\nOne Stockholders and Discover Stockholders\u0094\nbeginning on page 174 for a discussion of the\ndifferent rights associated with Capital One\ncommon stock.\n\nCapital One stockholders and Discover\nstockholders will not have dissenters\u0092 rights\nor appraisal rights in connection with the\nmergers or other matters to be voted on at the\nCapital One special meeting and Discover\nspecial meeting, respectively.\n\nAppraisal rights (also known\nas dissenters\u0092 rights) are statutory rights\nthat, if applicable under law, enable\nstockholders to dissent from an extraordinary\ntransaction, such as a merger, and to demand\nthat the corporation pay the fair value for\ntheir shares as determined\nby a court in a judicial proceeding instead of\nreceiving the consideration offered to\nstockholders in connection with the\nextraordinary transaction. Under Section 262\nof the DGCL, Capital One stockholders and\nDiscover stockholders are not\nentitled to appraisal or dissenters\u0092 rights in\nconnection with the mergers or the issuance of\nCapital One common stock in connection with\nthe mergers. See the section entitled \u0093The\nMergers\u0097Appraisal or Dissenters\u0092 Rights in\nConnection with the Mergers\u0094 beginning on page\n98.\n\nIssuance of shares of Capital One common stock\nin connection with the mergers may adversely\naffect the market price of Capital One common\nstock.\n\nIn connection with the payment of the merger\nconsideration, Capital One expects to issue\napproximately [ ] million shares of Capital\nOne common stock to Discover stockholders. The\nissuance of these new shares of Capital One\ncommon stock may result in fluctuations in\nthe market price of Capital One common stock,\nincluding a stock price decrease.\n\nStockholder litigation related to the mergers\ncould prevent or delay the completion of the\nmergers, result in the payment of damages or\notherwise negatively impact the business and\noperations of Capital One and Discover.\n\nStockholders of Capital One and/or Discover\nmay file lawsuits against Capital One,\nDiscover and/or the directors or officers of\neither company\nin connection with the mergers. One of the\nconditions to the closing is that no order,\ninjunction or decree issued by any court or\ngovernmental entity of competent jurisdiction\nor other legal restraint or prohibition\npreventing the consummation of\nthe mergers, the bank merger or any of the\nother transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement be in effect. If any plaintiff were\nsuccessful in obtaining an injunction\nprohibiting Capital One or Discover defendants\nfrom completing the mergers,\nthe bank merger or any of the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, then such injunction may delay or\nprevent the consummation of the mergers and\ncould result in significant costs to Capital\nOne and/or Discover, including any cost\nassociated with the indemnification of\ndirectors and officers of each company.\nCapital One and Discover may incur costs in\nconnection with the defense or settlement of\nany stockholder lawsuits filed in connection\nwith the mergers, the bank merger or\nany other transactions contemplated by the\nmerger agreement. Such litigation\n\n37\n\ncould have an adverse effect on the financial\ncondition and results of operations of Capital\nOne and Discover and could prevent or delay\nthe completion of the mergers. There has not\nbeen any\nstockholder litigation related to the mergers\nagainst Capital One, Discover or the directors\nor officers of either company, but such\nlitigation could be instigated.\n\nRisks Relating to Capital One\u0092s Business\n\nYou should read and consider risk factors\nspecific to Capital One\u0092s business that will\nalso affect Capital One after the mergers.\nThese\nrisks are described in the \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 and\n\u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\u0094\nsections of Capital One\u0092s Annual Report on\nForm\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and\nin any updates to those risk factors set forth\nin Capital One\u0092s Quarterly Reports on Form\n10-Q and in other\ndocuments incorporated by reference into this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus.

Matters\nto Be Considered At the Capital One special\nmeeting, Capital One stockholders will be\nasked to consider and vote on the following\nproposals:\n                                              \n      the Capital One share issuance          \n      proposal; and                           \n                                              \n                                             \n      the Capital One adjournment proposal.  \n                                             \nRecommendation of the Capital One Board of\nDirectors The Capital One board of directors\nunanimously recommends that you vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the\nCapital One share issuance proposal and \u0093FOR\u0094\nthe Capital One adjournment proposal. See the\nsection entitled \u0093 The Mergers\u0097Capital One\u0092s\nReasons for the Mergers; Recommendation of the\nCapital One Board of Directors\u0094 beginning on\npage 60for a more detailed discussion of the\nCapital One board of directors\u0092\nrecommendation. Record Date and Quorum The\nCapital One board of directors has fixed the\nclose of business on [ ], 2024 (the \u0093Capital\nOne record date\u0094) as the record date for\ndetermination of Capital One stockholders\nentitled to notice of and to vote at the\nCapital One special meeting. On the Capital\nOne record date for the Capital One special\nmeeting, there were [ ] shares of Capital One\ncommon stock outstanding. Holders of a\nmajority of the voting power of shares of\nCapital One common stock outstanding on the\nCapital One record date must be present,\neither in person or by proxy, to constitute a\nquorum at the Capital One special meeting. If\nyou fail to submit a proxy or to vote in\nperson at the Capital One special meeting,\nyour shares of Capital One common stock will\nnot be counted towards a quorum. Abstentions\nare considered present for purposes of\nestablishing a quorum. At the Capital One\nspecial meeting, each share of Capital One\ncommon stock is entitled to one (1) vote on\nall matters properly submitted to Capital One\nstockholders. As of the Capital One record\ndate, Capital One directors and executive\nofficers and their affiliates owned and were\nentitled to vote approximately [ ] shares of\nCapital One common stock, representing less\nthan [ ]% of the outstanding shares of Capital\nOne common stock. We currently expect that\nCapital One\u0092s directors and executive officers\nwill vote their shares in favor of the Capital\nOne share issuance proposal and the Capital\nOne adjournment proposal, although none of\nthem has entered into any agreements\nobligating them to do so. 39\n\nBroker Non-Votes\n\nA broker non-vote occurs when a bank, broker,\ntrustee or other nominee is not permitted to\nvote on a \u0093non-routine\u0094 matter without\ninstructions from the beneficial owner of the\nshares and the beneficial owner fails to\nprovide the bank, broker, trustee or other\nnominee with such instructions. Broker non-\nvotes only count toward a quorum if at least\none proposal is presented with respect to\nwhich the bank, broker, trustee or other\nnominee has discretionary authority. It is\nexpected that all proposals to be voted\non at the Capital One special meeting will be\n\u0093non-routine\u0094 matters, and, as such, broker\nnon-votes, if any, will not be counted as\npresent and entitled to\nvote for purposes of determining a quorum at\nthe Capital One special meeting. If your bank,\nbroker, trustee or other nominee holds your\nshares of Capital One common stock in \u0093street\nname,\u0094 such entity will vote your shares of\nCapital One\ncommon stock only if you provide instructions\non how to vote by complying with the\ninstructions provided to you by your bank,\nbroker, trustee or other nominee with this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus. Please check\nthe voting instruction form used\nby your bank, broker, trustee or other\nnominee.\n\nVote Required; Treatment of Abstentions,\nBroker Non-Votesand Failure to Vote\n\nCapital One share issuance proposal:\n\n: Approval of the Capital One share issuance\nproposal requires the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the votes cast by\nCapital One stockholders at the special\nmeeting. Approval of the Capital One share\nissuance proposal is a condition to the\ncompletion of the first merger.\n\n: If you are present at the Capital\nOne special meeting and abstain from voting,\nor respond by proxy with an \u0093ABSTAIN,\u0094 it will\nhave no effect on such proposal. If you are\nnot present at the Capital One special meeting\nand do not respond by proxy or do not provide\nyour bank,\nbroker, trustee or other nominee with\ninstructions, as applicable, it will have no\neffect on such proposal.\n\nCapital One adjournment proposal:\n\n: Whether or not a quorum will be present at\nthe meeting, approval of the Capital One\nadjournment proposal requires the affirmative\nvote of the majority of the outstanding shares\nof Capital One common stock represented in\nperson or by proxy at the Capital One special\nmeeting. Approval of the Capital One\nadjournment proposal is not a\ncondition to the completion of the first\nmerger.\n\n: If you are present at the Capital One\nspecial meeting and abstain from voting, or\nrespond by proxy with an \u0093ABSTAIN,\u0094 it will\nhave the same effect as a vote \u0093AGAINST\u0094 such\nproposal. If you are not present at\nthe Capital One special meeting and do not\nrespond by proxy or do not provide your bank,\nbroker, trustee or other nominee with\ninstructions, as applicable, it will have no\neffect on the vote count for such proposal.\n\nAttending the Special Meeting\n\nDue to space limitations, attendance is\nlimited to stockholders and persons holding\nvalid legal proxies from those stockholders.\nAdmission to\nthe meeting is on a first-come, first-served\nbasis.

Proxies A Capital One stockholder\nmay vote by proxy or in person at the Capital\nOne special meeting. If you hold your shares\nof Capital One common stock in your name as a\nholder of record, to submit a proxy, you, as a\nCapital One stockholder, may use one of the\nfollowing methods:\n                                              \n      By telephone: by calling the toll-free  \n      number indicated on the accompanying    \n      proxy card and following the            \n      recorded instructions.                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      Through the Internet: by visiting the   \n      website indicated on the accompanying   \n      proxy card and following the            \n      instructions.                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      By mail: by completing and returning    \n      the accompanying proxy card in the      \n      enclosed postage-paid envelope.         \n      The envelope requires no additional     \n      postage if mailed in the United         \n      States.                                 \n                                              \nCapital One requests that Capital One\nstockholders vote by telephone, over the\nInternet or by completing and signing the\naccompanying proxy card and returning it to\nCapital One as soon as possible in the\nenclosed postage-paid envelope. When the\naccompanying proxy card is returned properly\nexecuted, the shares of Capital One common\nstock represented by it will be voted at the\nCapital One special meeting in accordance with\nthe instructions contained on the proxy card.\nIf a holder\u0092s shares are held in \u0093street name\u0094\nby a bank, broker, trustee or other nominee,\nthe holder should check the voting form used\nby that firm to determine whether the holder\nmay vote by telephone or the Internet. Every\nvote is important. Accordingly, you should\nsign, date and return the enclosed proxy card,\nor vote via the Internet or by telephone,\nwhether or not you plan to attend the Capital\nOne special meeting in person. Sending in your\nproxy card or voting by telephone or on the\nInternet will not prevent you from voting your\nshares personally at the meeting because you\nmay revoke your proxy at any time before it is\nvoted. Shares Held in Street Name If your\nshares are held in \u0093street name\u0094 through a\nbank, broker, trustee or other nominee, you\nmust instruct the bank, broker trustee or\nother nominee on how to vote your shares. Your\nbank, broker, trustee or other nominee will\nvote your shares only if you provide specific\ninstructions on how to vote by following the\ninstructions provided to you by your bank,\nbroker, trustee or other nominee. Please check\nthe voting instruction form used by your bank,\nbroker, trustee or other nominee. You may not\nvote shares held in street name by returning a\nproxy card directly to Capital One or by\nvoting in person at the Capital One special\nmeeting unless you provide a \u0093legal proxy\u0094\ngiving you the right to vote the shares, which\nyou must obtain from your bank, broker,\ntrustee or other nominee. If you choose to\nvote your shares in person at the Capital One\nspecial meeting, you must present a valid\ngovernment-issued picture identification and a\ncopy of a brokerage statement reflecting your\nstock ownership as of the Capital One record\ndate. Further, banks, brokers, trustees or\nother nominees who hold shares of Capital One\ncommon stock on behalf of their customers may\nnot give a proxy to Capital One to vote those\nshares with respect to any of the proposals\nwithout specific instructions from their\ncustomers, as banks, brokers, trustees and\nother nominees do not have discretionary\nvoting power on the proposals that will be\nvoted upon at the Capital One special meeting.\n41\n\nRevocability of Proxies If you directly hold\nshares of Capital One common stock in your\nname as a record holder, you can change your\nvote at any time before your proxy is voted at\nyour meeting.

Under the\nNYSE rules, stockholder approval is required\nprior to the issuance of shares of common\nstock in any\ntransaction or series of related transactions\nif the number of shares of common stock to be\nissued is equal to or in excess of 20% of the\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding\nbefore the issuance of the shares of common\nstock pursuant to the\ntransaction. If the first merger is completed,\nthe number of shares of Capital One common\nstock issued in connection with the first\nmerger will exceed 20% of the Capital One\ncommon stock outstanding before such issuance.\nIn this proposal, Capital\nOne is asking Capital One stockholders to\nauthorize the issuance of Capital One common\nstock in connection with the first merger.\n\nThe\napproval of the Capital One share issuance\nproposal is a condition to the completion of\nthe first merger.\n\nThe Capital One board of directors unanimously\nrecommends a vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the Capital One share\nissuance proposal.\n\nPROPOSAL 2: CAPITAL ONE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL\n\nThe Capital One special meeting may be\nadjourned to another time or place, if\nnecessary or appropriate, to solicit\nadditional proxies\nif, immediately prior to such adjournment,\nthere are insufficient votes to approve the\nCapital One share issuance proposal or to\nensure that any supplement or amendment to\nthis joint proxy statement/prospectus is\ntimely provided to Capital One\nstockholders.\n\nIf, at the Capital One special meeting, the\nnumber of shares of Capital One common stock\npresent in person or represented\nby proxy and voting in favor of the Capital\nOne share issuance proposal is insufficient to\napprove the Capital One share issuance\nproposal, Capital One intends to move to\nadjourn the Capital One special meeting in\norder to enable the Capital One\nboard of directors to solicit additional\nproxies for approval of the Capital One share\nissuance proposal. In that event, Capital One\nwill ask Capital One stockholders to vote upon\nthe Capital One adjournment proposal, but not\nthe Capital One share\nissuance proposal.\n\nIn this proposal, Capital One is asking\nCapital One stockholders to authorize the\nholder of any proxy solicited by the\nCapital One board of directors, on a\ndiscretionary basis, to vote in favor of\nadjourning the Capital One special meeting to\nanother time and place for the purpose of\nsoliciting additional proxies, including the\nsolicitation of proxies from Capital\nOne stockholders who have previously voted.\nPursuant to the Capital One bylaws, the\nCapital One special meeting may be adjourned\nwithout further notice being given. However,\npursuant to the DGCL, if the adjournment is\nfor more than thirty\n(30) days, or if after the adjournment a new\nrecord date is fixed for the adjourned\nmeeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting\nmust be given to each stockholder of record\nentitled to vote at the meeting.\n\nThe approval of the Capital One adjournment\nproposal by Capital One stockholders is not a\ncondition to the completion of the first\nmerger.\n\nThe Capital One board of directors unanimously\nrecommends a vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the Capital One\nadjournment proposal.\n\n44\n\nTHE DISCOVER SPECIAL MEETING This section\ncontains information for Discover stockholders\nabout the special meeting that Discover has\ncalled to allow Discover stockholders to\nconsider and vote on the Discover merger\nproposal, the Discover compensation proposal\nand the Discover adjournment proposal. This\njoint proxy statement/prospectus is\naccompanied by a notice of the Discover\nspecial meeting, and a form of proxy card that\nthe Discover board of directors is soliciting\nfor use by Discover stockholders at the\nspecial meeting and at any adjournments or\npostponements of the special meeting. Date,\nTime and Place of the Meeting The Discover\nspecial meeting will be held on [ ], 2024 at\n2500 Lake Cook Road, Riverwoods, Illinois,\n60015 at [ ] [a.m.][p.m.], [Central Time].\nOnly holders of record of Discover common\nstock as of the close of business on the\nrecord date for the Discover special meeting\nare entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the\nDiscover special meeting or any adjournment or\npostponement thereof. Matters to Be Considered\nAt the Discover special meeting, Discover\nstockholders will be asked to consider and\nvote on the following proposals:\n                                     \n      the Discover merger proposal;  \n                                     \n                                              \n      the Discover compensation proposal;     \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                          \n      the Discover adjournment proposal.  \n                                          \nRecommendation of the Discover Board of\nDirectors The Discover board of directors\nunanimously recommends that Discover\nstockholders vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the Discover merger\nproposal, \u0093FOR\u0094 the Discover compensation\nproposal and \u0093FOR\u0094 the Discover adjournment\nproposal. See the section entitled \u0093 The\nMergers\u0097Discover\u0092s Reasons for the Mergers;\nRecommendation of the Discover Board of\nDirectors\u0094 beginning on page 63for a more\ndetailed discussion of the Discover board of\ndirectors\u0092 recommendation. Record Date and\nQuorum The Discover board of directors has\nfixed the close of business on [ ], 2024 (the\n\u0093Discover record date\u0094) as the record date for\nthe determination of Discover stockholders\nentitled to notice of and to vote at the\nDiscover special meeting. As of the Discover\nrecord date, there were [ ] shares of Discover\ncommon stock outstanding. Holders of a\nmajority of the total number of outstanding\nshares of Discover common stock entitled to\nvote at the Discover special meeting must be\npresent, either in attendance at the Discover\nspecial meeting or by proxy, to constitute a\nquorum at the Discover special meeting. If you\nfail to submit a proxy prior to the special\nmeeting, or to vote at the Discover special\nmeeting, your shares of Discover common stock\nwill not be counted towards a quorum.\nAbstentions are considered present for the\npurpose of establishing a quorum. Under the\nDiscover bylaws, whether or not a quorum is\npresent at the Discover special meeting, the\nchair of the Discover board of directors or\nholders of a majority of the voting power of\nthe shares entitled to vote thereon may\nadjourn the Discover special meeting. 45\n\nAt the Discover special meeting, each share of\nDiscover common stock is entitled to cast one\n(1) vote for each share of Discover common\nstock entitled to vote at the Discover special\nmeeting held by such stockholder on all\nmatters properly submitted to Discover\nstockholders. Shares of Discover preferred\nstock (and depositary shares\nrepresenting Discover preferred stock) are not\nentitled to any votes at the Discover special\nmeeting.\n\nAs of the close of business on the\nDiscover record date, Discover directors and\nexecutive officers and their affiliates owned\nand were entitled to vote approximately [ ]\nshares of Discover common stock, representing\nless than [ ] percent\n([ ]%) of the outstanding shares of Discover\ncommon stock.

These\nstrategic discussions have focused on, among\nother things, the business and regulatory\nenvironment facing financial institutions\ngenerally and Capital One and Discover,\nrespectively, in particular, as well as\nconditions and trends affecting the\nfinancial services industry. While various\npotential acquirers were rumored to have\nconsidered an acquisition of Discover in the\nseveral years prior to its execution of the\nmerger agreement, Discover had not\nparticipated in meaningful discussions\nwith any potential acquirers and it was\ngenerally pursuing a standalone business\nstrategy during this time.\n\n54\n\nIn July 2023, Discover disclosed a card\nproduct misclassification issue and a related\nliability of $365 million, as well as a\nproposed FDIC consent order. In addition, on\nAugust 14, 2023, Discover announced the\nresignation of its Chief Executive Officer and\nthat John Owen, a member of the Discover board\nof directors, was\nappointed interim Chief Executive Officer and\nPresident, and Discover engaged a leading\nglobal executive search firm to commence a\nprocess to identify a permanent Chief\nExecutive Officer. Following these\nannouncements and a decline in the trading\nprice of Discover common stock, Thomas\nMaheras, the independent Chairman of the\nDiscover board of directors received several\ninquiries, largely from investment bankers,\nregarding Discover\u0092s future strategic\ndirection and its willingness to\nconsider potential strategic options. Mr.\nMaheras reported to the Discover board of\ndirectors that he had received such inquiries\nand indicated that, although these were not\nactionable inquiries, he would keep the\nDiscover board of directors\ninformed of any subsequent inquiries and\ndiscussions that did indeed merit further\nconsideration.\n\nThese inquiries included outreach from\nStephen Crawford, a senior advisor to Richard\nFairbank, Capital One\u0092s Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chairman, who contacted Mr.\nMaheras in the middle of August 2023.\nThereafter, Mr. Crawford and Mr. Maheras had\nseveral high-level\nconversations regarding the financial services\nindustry, the business and strategies of their\nrespective companies and touched upon\nDiscover\u0092s ongoing Chief Executive Officer\nsearch process. In one of these conversations,\nMr. Crawford\nasked if Mr. Maheras would be willing to meet\nwith him and Mr. Fairbank. Mr. Maheras agreed\nand a meeting was arranged for September 13,\n2023 in New York City. During this time, in\nthe middle of August 2023, Capital One\nselected\nCenterview to serve as its financial advisor\nand Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz (\u0093Wachtell\nLipton\u0094) to serve as its counsel in connection\nwith Capital One\u0092s evaluation of a potential\nacquisition of Discover.\n\nOn September 8, 2023, a special meeting of the\nCapital One board of directors was held to\ndiscuss a potential acquisition of Discover,\nwhich was attended by members of Capital One\nmanagement. At the meeting, Mr. Fairbank and\nMr. Crawford summarized Mr. Crawford\u0092s\ndiscussions with Mr. Maheras and provided an\noverview, based on publicly available\ninformation,\nof Discover\u0092s business, financial position and\ncompliance issues and risks, as well as\npreliminary views on potential synergies and\nother benefits that could be realized through\nan acquisition of Discover by Capital One.\n\nMr. Maheras, Mr. Crawford and Mr. Fairbank met\non September 13, 2023. At the meeting, Mr.\nFairbank discussed his\nviews on Capital One and Discover\u0092s respective\nbusinesses, his longstanding appreciation for\nDiscover and the potential benefits of a\ncombination of Capital One and Discover.\nCapital One\u0092s presentation to Mr. Maheras in\nthe meeting\nindicated that Capital One would potentially\nbe willing to consider a stock for stock\ntransaction that included a 30% premium to the\ntrading price of Discover common stock. At the\nconclusion of the meeting, Mr. Maheras stated\nthat Discover was\nnot actively seeking any combination or other\nstrategic transaction at the present time.\n\nThe Discover board of directors met on\nSeptember 22, 2023, and at that meeting, Mr.\nMaheras reported that he had received certain\ninquiries and it was possible that he would\nreceive additional inquiries regarding\npotential strategic transactions. Mr. Maheras,\nreferring to\nthe discussions with Capital One, informed the\ndirectors of his view that one such inquiry\nlikely merited further consideration. For the\nsake of efficiency given the circumstances,\nthe board determined to assemble a subset of\ndirectors to take the\nlead on evaluating actionable inquiries and\npursuing discussions in advance of further\nconsideration of such inquiries by the board.\nFollowing this meeting, this subset of\ndirectors was identified and it included Mr.\nMaheras, Jeffrey Aronin,\nGregory Case, Michael Shepherd and Mark\nThierer (such directors collectively, the\n\u0093Discover director subgroup\u0094). On October 3,\n2023, the Discover director subgroup met as a\ngroup for the first time, and Mr. Maheras\nupdated the\nDiscover director subgroup on the inquiries\nreceived and discussions held to date,\nincluding those with Capital One.\n\nMr. Crawford\nand Mr. Maheras continued their discussions\nand agreed to hold a further meeting in the\nChicago area on October 24, 2023, with members\nof the Discover director subgroup in\nattendance. At this meeting, Mr. Fairbank and\nMr. Crawford elaborated on the potential\nbenefits of a combination between Capital One\nand Discover, including the two companies\u0092\ncomplementary businesses and the potential\nsynergies that could be obtained through a\ncombination of Discover\nand Capital One. At this meeting, Mr. Fairbank\nreiterated that Capital One would potentially\nbe willing to pursue a transaction that\nincluded a 30% price premium.\n\n55\n\nMr. Maheras and the other Discover directors\nin attendance restated that Discover was not\nactively seeking any combination or other\nstrategic transaction at the present time.\n\nThe Discover board of directors held regular\nmeetings on October 25 and 26, 2023, in the\nChicago area, and during the course of these\nmeetings, Mr. Maheras and other members of the\nDiscover director subgroup informed the\nDiscover board of directors of the discussions\nwith Capital One, including the transaction\nrationale and indicative terms which had been\npresented in their\nrecent meeting with Messrs. Fairbank and\nCrawford. Mr. Maheras also reported that there\nhad been no other proposals from a principal\nof any other banking organization.\n\nA regularly scheduled meeting of the Capital\nOne board of directors was held in early\nNovember 2023, which was attended by members\nof Capital\nOne management as well as representatives of\nCenterview and Wachtell Lipton. During this\nmeeting, Mr. Fairbank and Mr. Crawford\nprovided an update to the Capital One board of\ndirectors regarding the potential acquisition\nof Discover and\ntheir discussions with Mr. Maheras and other\nmembers of the Discover board of directors.\nCapital One management provided the Capital\nOne board of directors an overview, based on\npublicly available information, of the\nfinancial position and\nperformance of Discover, its businesses,\nincluding its network and brand, as well as of\nthe potential financial implications of a\npotential acquisition of Discover by Capital\nOne, including potential synergies and other\nbenefits that could be\nrealized through an acquisition, management\u0092s\npreliminary expectations with respect to\ntransaction structure, and regulatory\nconsiderations with respect to a potential\nacquisition, including relating to Discover\u0092s\npublicly disclosed\ncompliance issues.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, Mr. Maheras met with the\nDiscover director subgroup and the subgroup\ndiscussed whether\nto move forward with more formal meetings and\ndiscussions with Capital One. On the same day,\nduring a meeting of the Discover board of\ndirectors, Mr. Maheras updated the board on\nthe ongoing discussions with Capital One and\nindicated that he\nwas expecting to speak again with Mr. Crawford\nin the coming days.\n\nMr. Crawford and Mr. Maheras spoke briefly on\nNovember 17, 2023 and set up an in-person\nmeeting to be held on November 20, 2023 in New\nYork City.\n\nIn that discussion on November 20, 2023, Mr.\nCrawford asked Mr. Maheras for his reaction to\nthe previous presentations and what\nthe Discover board of directors would require,\nin Mr. Maheras\u0092s view, to proceed further with\nrespect to the potential transaction. Mr.\nMaheras again indicated that Discover was not\nformally considering a combination or other\nstrategic transaction at the present time and\nthat he was unsure whether a 30% premium would\nbe considered sufficient by the Discover board\nof directors to merit proceeding further with\nrespect to the potential transaction. In\nresponse,\nMr. Crawford suggested that Capital One may be\nwilling to engage in a transaction that\nincluded a premium of 33%.\n\nFollowing the\nmeeting between Mr. Crawford and Mr. Maheras,\non November 22, 2023, the Discover director\nsubgroup met to discuss the potential\ntransaction and next steps, including\nselecting Morgan Stanley & Co.

In reaching its\ndecision to approve the merger agreement and\nthe transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, the Capital One board of directors\ndid not quantify or assign any relative\nweights to the factors considered, and\nindividual directors may have given different\nweights to different factors. The board\nconsidered all these factors as a whole, and\noverall considered the factors to support its\ndetermination. For the reasons set forth\nabove, the Capital One board of directors\ndetermined that the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby (including\nthe mergers and the Capital One share\nissuance) are advisable and fair to and in the\nbest interests of Capital One and its\nstockholders. It should be noted that this\nexplanation of the reasoning of the Capital\nOne board of directors and all other\ninformation presented in this section is\nforward-looking in nature and, therefore,\nshould be read in light of the risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions discussed in the\nsection entitled \u0093 Cautionary Statement\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements \u0094\nbeginning on page 27. 62\n\nDiscover\u0092s Reasons for the Mergers;\nRecommendation of the Discover Board of\nDirectors In reaching its decision to approve\nand adopt the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated thereby, and to\nrecommend that Discover stockholders adopt the\nmerger agreement, the Discover board of\ndirectors evaluated the merger agreement and\nthe transactions contemplated thereby in\nconsultation with Discover\u0092s management, as\nwell as with Discover\u0092s legal and financial\nadvisors, and considered a number of factors,\nincluding the following principal factors:\n                                              \n      each of Discover\u0092s, Capital One\u0092s and     \n      the surviving entity\u0092s business,         \n      operations, financial                   \n      condition, stock performance, asset     \n      quality, earnings and prospects; in     \n      reviewing these factors, including the  \n      information obtained through due        \n      diligence, the Discover board of        \n      directors considered Capital One\u0092s       \n      financial condition and asset           \n      quality; that Capital One\u0092s business,    \n      operations and risk profile complement  \n      those of Discover and that Capital      \n      One\u0092s earnings and prospects, and the    \n      synergies and scale potentially         \n      available in the proposed transaction,  \n      create the                              \n      opportunity for the surviving entity    \n      to leverage complementary and           \n      diversified revenue streams and to      \n      have superior future earnings and       \n      prospects compared to Discover\u0092s         \n      earnings and prospects on a             \n      stand-alone basis;

Although\neach member of the Discover board of directors\nindividually considered these and other\nfactors, the Discover board of directors did\nnot collectively assign any specific or\nrelative weights to the factors considered and\ndid not make any determination with respect to\nany individual factor. The Discover board of\ndirectors considered all these factors as a\nwhole, including through its discussions with\nDiscover\u0092s management and financial and legal\nadvisors, in evaluating the merger agreement\nand the transactions contemplated thereby,\nincluding the mergers. The Discover board of\ndirectors collectively made its determination\nbased on the conclusion reached by its\nmembers, in light of the factors that each of\nthem considered appropriate, that the\ntransaction is in the best interests of\nDiscover, its stockholders and its other\nconstituencies. The Discover board of\ndirectors realized that there can be no\nassurance about future results, including\nresults expected or considered in the factors\nlisted above, such as assumptions regarding\nanticipated cost savings and earnings\naccretion/dilution. The Discover board of\ndirectors concluded, however, that the\npotential positive factors outweighed the\npotential risks of completing the mergers. In\nconsidering the recommendation of the Discover\nboard of directors, you should be aware that\ncertain directors and executive officers of\nDiscover may have interests in the mergers\nthat are different from, or in addition to,\ninterests of stockholders of Discover\ngenerally and may create potential conflicts\nof interest. The Discover board of directors\nwas aware of these interests and considered\nthem when evaluating and negotiating the\nmerger agreement, the mergers and the other\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, and in recommending to Discover\u0092s\nstockholders that they vote in favor of the\nDiscover merger proposal. See the section\nentitled \u0093 The Mergers\u0097Interests of Discover\u0092s\nDirectors and Executive Officers in the\nMergers\u0094 beginning on page 87. It should be\nnoted that this explanation of the reasoning\nof the Discover board of directors and all\nother information presented in this section is\nforward-looking in nature and, therefore,\nshould be read in light of the factors\ndiscussed in the section entitled \u0093 Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements\u0094 beginning on page 27. For the\nreasons set forth above, the Discover board of\ndirectors unanimously recommends that the\nDiscover stockholders vote \u0093FOR\u0094 the Discover\nmerger proposal.

The summary set forth below does not\npurport to be a complete description of the\nfinancial analyses performed or factors\nconsidered by, and underlying the opinion of,\nCenterview, nor does the order of the\nfinancial analyses described represent the\nrelative importance or weight given to those\nfinancial analyses by Centerview. Centerview\nmay have deemed various assumptions more or\nless probable than other assumptions, so the\nreference ranges resulting from any particular\nportion of the analyses summarized below\nshould not be taken to be Centerview\u0092s view of\nthe actual value of Discover or Capital One.\nSome of the summaries of the financial\nanalyses set forth below include information\npresented in tabular format. In order to fully\nunderstand the financial analyses, the tables\nmust be read together with the text of each\nsummary, as the tables alone do not constitute\na complete description of the financial\nanalyses performed by Centerview. Considering\nthe data in the tables below without\nconsidering all financial analyses or factors\nor the full narrative description of such\nanalyses or factors, including the\nmethodologies and assumptions underlying such\nanalyses or factors, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of the processes underlying\nCenterview\u0092s financial analyses and its\nopinion.In performing its analyses, Centerview\nmade numerous assumptions with respect to\nindustry\nperformance, general business and economic\nconditions and other matters, many of which\nare beyond the control of Discover, Capital\nOne or any other parties to the Transaction.\nNone of Capital One, Discover, Merger Sub or\nCenterview or any other\nperson assumes responsibility if future\nresults are materially different from those\ndiscussed. Any estimates contained in these\nanalyses are not necessarily indicative of\nactual values or predictive of future results\nor values, which may be\nsignificantly more or less favorable than as\nset forth below. In addition, analyses\nrelating to the value of Discover or Capital\nOne do not purport to be appraisals or reflect\nthe prices at which Discover or Capital One\nmay actually be sold.\nAccordingly, the assumptions and estimates\nused in, and the results derived from, the\nfinancial analyses are inherently subject\n\n68\n\nto substantial uncertainty. Except as\notherwise noted, the following quantitative\ninformation, to the extent that it is based on\nmarket data, is based on market data as it\nexisted on or before February 16, 2024 (the\nlast trading day before the public\nannouncement of the Transaction) and is not\nnecessarily indicative of current market\nconditions. Selected Public Comparable\nCompanies Analysis Centerview reviewed and\nanalyzed certain financial information, ratios\nand multiples for the below listed publicly\ntraded companies that Centerview, based on its\nexperience and professional judgment, deemed\nrelevant to consider in relation to Discover\nand Capital One. Although none of the selected\ncompanies is directly comparable to Discover,\nCapital One or the surviving entity, the\ncompanies listed below were chosen by\nCenterview, among other reasons, because they\nare publicly traded companies that have\ncertain operational, business and/or financial\ncharacteristics that, for purposes of\nCenterview\u0092s analyses, Centerview considered\nsimilar to those of Discover, Capital One and\nthe surviving entity. However, because none of\nthe selected companies is exactly the same as\nDiscover or Capital One, Centerview believed\nthat it was inappropriate to, and therefore\ndid not, rely solely on the quantitative\nresults of the selected companies analysis.\nAccordingly, Centerview also made qualitative\njudgments, based on its experience and\nprofessional judgment, concerning differences\nbetween the business, financial and operating\ncharacteristics and prospects of Discover,\nCapital One and the selected companies that\ncould affect the public trading values of each\nin order to provide a context in which to\nconsider the results of the quantitative\nanalysis. Using publicly available filings and\ninformation obtained from regulatory filings\nand other data sources as of February 16,\n2024, Centerview calculated, for each selected\ncomparable company: (i) a multiple of price to\nestimated earnings per share for the fiscal\nyear 2024 (referred to in this section as\n\u00932024E P/E\u0094); and (ii) a regression analysis\n(referred to in this section as \u0093P/TBV\nRegression\u0094) to review the relationship\nbetween (x) a multiple of price to tangible\nbook value per share (referred to in this\nsection as \u0093P/TBV\u0094) and (y) the estimated 2024\nreturn on average tangible common equity\n(referred to in this section as \u00932024E\nROATCE\u0094).\n                                              \n  Discover       2024E    P/TBV     2024E     \n  Comparables    P/E               ROATCE     \n  Ally                                        \n  Financial      11.0x    1.02x       9.5  %  \n  Inc.                                        \n  American                                    \n  Express        16.5x    7.10x      37.4  %  \n  Company                                     \n  Capital One                                 \n  Financial      9.9x     1.38x      13.5  %  \n  Corporation                                 \n  Citizens                                    \n  Financial      9.9x     1.02x      10.2  %  \n  Group, Inc.                                 \n  Fifth Third    10.6x    1.92x      17.2  %  \n  Bancorp                                     \n  PNC                                         \n  Financial      11.9x    1.75x      14.3  %  \n  Service                                     \n  Group, Inc.                                 \n  Synchrony      7.1x     1.43x      18.8  %  \n  Financial                                   \n  Truist                                      \n  Financial      10.5x    1.65x      15.8  %  \n  Corporation                                 \n  U.S.           10.5x    1.86x      17.3  %  \n  Bancorp                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n  Capital One    2024E    P/TBV     2024E     \n  Comparables    P/E               ROATCE     \n  Ally                                        \n  Financial      11.0x    1.02x       9.5  %  \n  Inc.                                        \n  American                                    \n  Express        16.5x    7.10x      37.4  %  \n  Company                                     \n  Citizens                                    \n  Financial      9.9x     1.02x      10.2  %  \n  Group, Inc.                                 \n  Discover                                    \n  Financial      9.7x     2.04x      18.8  %  \n  Services                                    \n  Fifth Third    10.6x    1.92x      17.2  %  \n  Bancorp                                     \n  PNC                                         \n  Financial      11.9x    1.75x      14.3  %  \n  Service                                     \n  Group, Inc.                                 \n  Synchrony      7.1x     1.43x      18.8  %  \n  Financial                                   \n  Truist                                      \n  Financial      10.5x    1.65x      15.8  %  \n  Corporation                                 \n  U.S.           10.5x    1.86x      17.3  %  \n  Bancorp                                     \n                                              \n69\n\nBased on the results of this analysis and\nother factors which Centerview considered\nappropriate based on its experience and\njudgment, Centerview selected multiple\nreference ranges for Discover and Capital One\nset forth below:\n                                              \n                 2024E\u00a0P/E      P/TBV\u00a0        \n                                Regression    \n  Discover       9.0x\u00a0\u0096\u00a011.0x    1.78x\u00a0\u0096\u00a02.11x  \n  Capital One    9.0x \u0096 11.0x    1.30x \u0096 1.53x  \n                                              \nFrom this analysis, Centerview then applied\nthe multiple reference range of 9.0x to 11.0x\nfor 2024E P/E to Discover\u0092s estimated earnings\nper share for the fiscal year 2024 of $11.16\nas derived from the Discover Forecasts and the\nDiscover Internal Data. Centerview performed a\nregression analysis using the P/TBV multiples\nfor the selected companies calculated by\nCenterview as described above compared to the\n2024E ROATCE for those selected companies\nusing the median estimates for such companies\nto derive a regression line reflecting a range\nof P/TBV multiples at a range of 2024E ROATCE\nfor the selected companies. Centerview\nobserved that the 2024E ROATCE for Discover of\n19.9%, as derived from the Discover Forecasts\nand the Discover Internal Data, corresponded\nto an implied P/TBV per share multiple of\n1.94x on the regression line. Centerview\ncalculated that the closing price for Discover\ncommon stock on February 16, 2024 reflected a\nmultiple of approximately 2.04x the tangible\nbook value per share of $54.04 based on the\nmost recent publicly available financial\ninformation as of December 31, 2023.\nCenterview applied a range of 2024E ROATCE for\nDiscover of 17.9% (a 10% decrease to the 2024E\nROATCE as derived from the Discover Forecasts\nand the Discover Internal Data) to 21.9% (a\n10% increase to the 2024E ROATCE as derived\nfrom the Discover Forecasts and the Discover\nInternal Data).

Centerview observed that\nthe 2024E ROATCE for Capital One of 13.3%, as\nreflected in the Capital One Internal Data\n(including the Capital One Forecasts),\ncorresponded to an implied P/TBV per share\nmultiple of 1.42x on the regression line.\nCenterview calculated that the closing price\nfor Capital One common stock on February 16,\n2024 reflected a multiple of approximately\n1.38x the tangible book value per share of\n$99.78, based on the most recent publicly\navailable financial information as of December\n31, 2023. 70\n\nCenterview applied a range of 2024E ROATCE for\nCapital One of 12.0% (a 10% decrease to the\n2024E ROATCE as reflected in the Capital One\nInternal Data (including the Capital One\nForecasts)) to 14.6% (a 10% increase to the\n2024E ROATCE as reflected in the Capital One\nInternal Data (including the Capital One\nForecasts)).

Using discount rates ranging from\n12.75% to 13.75%, reflecting estimates of the\ncost of equity for Discover on a stand-alone\nbasis, Centerview derived a range of\nillustrative equity values for Discover on a\nstand-alone basis by discounting to present\nvalue as of December 31, 2023, (a) the implied\ndistributions to Discover stockholders over\nthe period beginning January 1, 2024 through\nDecember 31, 2030 calculated based on the\nDiscover Forecasts and the Discover Internal\nData, which assumed that Discover would make\ndistributions of capital in excess of the\namount necessary to achieve a 12.0% CET1 ratio\ntarget, (b) a range of illustrative terminal\nvalues for Discover as of December 31, 2030,\ncalculated by applying illustrative price to\nearnings per share multiples ranging from 8.5x\nto 10.5x to the estimate of Discover\u0092s next\ntwelve (12)-month net income on a stand-alone\nbasis as of December 31, 2030 (calculated by\nCenterview based upon the terminal year (2030)\nnet income reflected in the Discover Forecasts\nand Discover Internal Data) and (c) adding on\na per share basis the implied net present\nvalue of the disposition of the student loan\nbusiness of Discover of approximately $7.25\nper share based on the Discover Forecasts and\nthe Discover Internal Data. To derive\nillustrative terminal values for Discover,\nCenterview applied illustrative price to\nearnings per share multiples based on its\nprofessional judgment and experience, taking\ninto account the multiples it calculated as\ndescribed above in the section entitled \u0093\n\u0097Selected Public Comparable Companies\nAnalysis.\u0094 Centerview divided the range of\nillustrative equity values it derived for\nDiscover by the total number of fully diluted\nshares of Discover common stock outstanding as\nof February 16, 2024 of 252.5 million, as\nprovided by Capital One management, to derive\nillustrative present values per share of\nDiscover common stock on a stand-alone basis\nranging from $120.50 to $141.75. Capital One\nStand-alone Dividend Discount Analysis Using\nthe Capital One Internal Data (including the\nCapital One Forecasts), Centerview performed\nan illustrative discounted dividend analysis\nfor Capital One on a stand-alone basis, to\nderive a range of illustrative present values\nper share of Capital One common stock on a\nstand-alone basis. Using discount rates\nranging from 12.25% to 13.25%, reflecting\nestimates of the cost of equity for Capital\nOne on a stand-alone basis, Centerview derived\na range of illustrative equity values for\nCapital One on a stand-alone basis by\ndiscounting to present value as of December\n31, 2023, (i) the implied distributions to\nCapital One stockholders over the period\nbeginning January 1, 2024 through December 31,\n2030 calculated based on the 71\n\nCapital One Internal Data (including the\nCapital One Forecasts), which assumed that\nCapital One would make distributions of\ncapital in excess of the amount necessary to\nachieve a 13.0% CET1 ratio target, and (ii) a\nrange of illustrative terminal values for\nCapital One as of December 31, 2030,\ncalculated by applying illustrative price to\nearnings per share multiples ranging from 8.5x\nto 10.5x to the estimate of Capital One\u0092s next\ntwelve (12)-monthnet income on a stand-alone\nbasis as of December 31, 2030 (calculated by\nCenterview based upon the terminal year (2030)\nnet income reflected in the Capital One\nInternal Data (including the Capital One\nForecasts)). To derive illustrative terminal\nvalues for Capital One, Centerview applied\nillustrative price to earnings per share\nmultiples based on its professional judgment\nand experience, taking into account the\nmultiples it calculated as described above in\nthe section entitled \u0093 \u0097Selected Public\nComparable Companies Analysis.\u0094 Centerview\ndivided the range of illustrative equity\nvalues it derived for Capital One by the total\nnumber of fully diluted shares of Capital One\ncommon stock outstanding as of February 16,\n2024 of 392.4 million, as provided by Capital\nOne management, to derive illustrative present\nvalues per share of Capital One common stock\non a stand-alone basis ranging from $115.00 to\n$136.75. Relative Valuation Analysis Based\nupon a comparison of the range of implied\nequity values for each of Discover and Capital\nOne calculated pursuant to the selected\ncomparable public companies analyses and the\ndividend discount analyses described above\n(and including, in the case of Discover, on a\nper share basis, the implied net present value\nof the disposition of the student loan\nbusiness of Discover of approximately $7.25\nper share based on the Discover Forecasts and\nDiscover Internal Data), Centerview calculated\nranges of implied exchange ratios for the\nmergers. With respect to any given range of\nexchange ratios, the higher ratio assumes the\nhighest implied value per share of Discover\ncommon stock divided by the lowest implied\nvalue per share of Capital One common stock,\nand the lower ratio assumes the lowest implied\nvalue per share of Discover common stock\ndivided by the highest implied value per share\nof Capital One common stock.\n                                              \n                 Range\u00a0of\u00a0      Range\u00a0of\u00a0     \n                 Implied\u00a0       Implied\u00a0      \n                 Exchange       Exchange      \n                 Ratios\u00a0        Ratios\u00a0       \n                 (excluding\u00a0    (including\u00a0   \n                 Synergies)     Synergies)    \n  2024 P/E       0.7031x\u00a0\u0096\u00a0      1.0913x\u00a0\u0096\u00a0     \n                 1.0359x        1.5099x       \n  P/TBV          0.6748x \u0096       1.0637x \u0096      \n  Regression     0.9344x        1.3938x       \n  Dividend       0.8812x \u0096       1.3163x \u0096      \n  Discount       1.2326x        1.7500x       \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nCenterview then compared the implied ranges of\nexchange ratios set forth above to the\nexchange ratio of 1.0192x. \u0093Has-Gets\u0094Value\nCreation Analysis Centerview compared the\nstand-alone per share value of Capital One to\nthe pro forma per share value of the surviving\nentity after giving effect to the mergers,\nincluding the pro forma ownership of Capital\nOne equityholders of 60.4% as a result of the\nexchange ratio pursuant to the mergers.\nCenterview determined the pro forma surviving\nentity equity value by calculating the sum of\n(i) the equity value of Capital One using the\nmidpoint value determined in Centerview\u0092s\ndividend discount analysis, (ii) the equity\nvalue of Discover derived using the midpoint\nvalue determined in Centerview\u0092s dividend\ndiscount analysis and (iii) the net present\nvalue of the Synergies.

In\narriving at its opinion, Centerview did not\ndraw, in isolation, conclusions from or with\nregard to any factor or analysis that it\nconsidered. Rather, Centerview made its\ndetermination as to fairness on the basis of\nits experience and professional judgment after\nconsidering the results of all of the\nanalyses. Centerview\u0092s financial analyses and\nopinion were only one of many factors taken\ninto consideration by the Capital One board of\ndirectors in its evaluation of the\nTransaction. Consequently, the analyses\ndescribed above should not be viewed as\ndeterminative of the views of the Capital One\nboard of directors or management of Capital\nOne with respect to the exchange ratio or as\nto whether the Capital One board of directors\nwould have been willing to determine that a\ndifferent consideration was fair. The\nconsideration for the Transaction was\ndetermined through arm\u0092s-lengthnegotiations\nbetween Capital One and Discover and was\napproved by the Capital One board of\ndirectors. Centerview provided advice to\nCapital One during these negotiations.\nCenterview did not, however, recommend any\nspecific amount of consideration to Capital\nOne or the Capital One board of directors or\nthat any specific amount of consideration\nconstituted the only appropriate consideration\nfor the Transaction.

PJT Partners assumed,\nwith the consent of the Discover board of\ndirectors, that the Projections and the\nSynergy Estimates and the assumptions\nunderlying the Projections and the Synergy\nEstimates, and all other financial analyses,\nestimates and forecasts provided to PJT\nPartners by Discover\u0092s management, were\nreasonably prepared in accordance with\nindustry practice and represented Discover\u0092s\nmanagement\u0092s (or, in the case of the Synergy\nEstimates, Capital One\u0092s management\u0092s) best\ncurrently available estimates and judgments as\nto the business and operations and future\nfinancial performance of Discover and Capital\nOne, as applicable. With the consent of the\nDiscover board of directors, PJT Partners did\nnot take into account any potential changes in\nthe regulatory capital requirements for\nDiscover or Capital One or any potential\nchanges in, or resulting impact on, the\nregulatory capital requirements of the\ncombined company during the forecast period.\nPJT Partners assumed no responsibility for and\nexpressed no opinion as to the Projections and\nthe Synergy Estimates, the assumptions upon\nwhich they were based or any other financial\nanalyses, estimates and forecasts provided to\nPJT Partners by Discover\u0092s management or\nCapital One\u0092s management. PJT Partners also\nassumed that there were no material changes in\nthe assets, financial condition, results of\noperations, business or prospects of Discover\nor Capital One since the respective dates of\nthe last financial statements made available\nto PJT Partners. PJT Partners relied, with the\nconsent of the Discover board of directors, on\nDiscover\u0092s management\u0092s representations and/or\nprojections regarding taxable income,\nstandalone net operating loss utilization and\nother tax attributes of Discover. PJT Partners\nfurther relied, with the consent of the\nDiscover board of directors, upon the\nassurances of the management of Discover that\nthey were not aware of any facts that would\nmake the information, representations and\nprojections provided by them or Capital One\u0092s\nmanagement inaccurate, incomplete or\nmisleading. 75\n\nPJT Partners was not asked to undertake, and\ndid not undertake, an independent verification\nof any information provided to or reviewed by\nit, nor was it furnished with any such\nverification and it did not assume any\nresponsibility or liability for the accuracy\nor completeness thereof. PJT Partners did not\nconduct a physical inspection of\nany of the properties or assets of Discover or\nCapital One. PJT Partners did not make an\nindependent evaluation or appraisal of the\nassets or the liabilities (contingent or\notherwise) of Discover or Capital One, nor was\nit furnished with any such\nevaluations or appraisals, nor did it evaluate\nthe solvency of Discover or Capital One under\nany applicable laws.\n\nPJT Partners also\nassumed, with the consent of the Discover\nboard of directors, that the final executed\nform of the merger agreement would not differ\nin any material respects from the draft\nreviewed by PJT Partners and that the\nconsummation of the mergers would be\neffected in accordance with the terms and\nconditions of the merger agreement, without\nwaiver, modification or amendment of any\nmaterial term, condition or agreement, and\nthat, in the course of obtaining the necessary\nregulatory or third party\nconsents and approvals (contractual or\notherwise) for the mergers, no delay,\nlimitation, restriction or condition would be\nimposed that would have an adverse effect on\nDiscover or Capital One or the contemplated\nbenefits of the mergers. PJT Partners\nalso assumed that the representations and\nwarranties made by Discover and Capital One in\nthe merger agreement and the related\nagreements were and will be true and correct\nin all respects material to PJT Partners\u0092\nanalysis. At the direction of\nthe Discover board of directors, PJT Partners\nassumed that it was intended for the mergers,\ntaken together, to qualify for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes as a reorganization within\nthe meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. PJT\nPartners did\nnot express any opinion as to any tax or other\nconsequences that might result from the\nmergers, nor did its opinion address any\nlegal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters,\nas to which PJT Partners understood that\nDiscover obtained such advice as\nit deemed necessary from qualified\nprofessionals. PJT Partners is not a legal,\ntax or regulatory advisor and relied upon\nwithout independent verification the\nassessment of Discover and its legal, tax and\nregulatory advisors with respect to such\nmatters.\n\nIn arriving at its opinion, PJT Partners was\nnot asked to solicit, and did not solicit,\ninterest from any party with respect to\nany sale, acquisition, business combination or\nother extraordinary transaction involving\nDiscover or its assets. PJT Partners did not\nconsider the relative merits of the mergers as\ncompared to any other business plan or\nopportunity that might be\navailable to Discover or the effect of any\nother arrangement in which Discover might\nengage and PJT Partners\u0092 opinion did not\naddress the underlying decision by Discover to\nengage in the mergers. PJT Partners\u0092 opinion\nwas limited to the\nfairness of the exchange ratio in the mergers\nas of the date of the opinion, from a\nfinancial point of view, to the holders of\nDiscover common stock (excluding the shares of\nDiscover common stock owned by Discover or\nCapital One (in each case\nexcluding the shares of Discover common stock\n(i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts,\nmutual funds and the like, or otherwise held\nin a fiduciary or agency capacity that are\nbeneficially owned by third parties or (ii)\nheld, directly\nor indirectly, by Discover or Capital One in\nrespect of debts previously contracted)), and\nPJT Partners\u0092 opinion did not address any\nother aspect or implication of the mergers,\nthe merger agreement, or any other agreement\nor understanding\nentered into in connection with the mergers or\notherwise. PJT Partners further expressed no\nopinion or view as to the fairness of the\nmergers to the holders of any other class of\nsecurities (including any preferred stock of\nDiscover), creditors or\nother constituencies of Discover or as to the\nunderlying decision by Discover to engage in\nthe mergers. PJT Partners also expressed no\nopinion as to the fairness of the amount or\nnature of the compensation to any of\nDiscover\u0092s officers,\ndirectors or employees, or any class of such\npersons, relative to the merger consideration\nto be received by the holders of Discover\ncommon stock (excluding the shares of Discover\ncommon stock owned by Discover or Capital One\n(in each case excluding\nthe shares of Discover common stock (i) held\nin trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual\nfunds and the like, or otherwise held in a\nfiduciary or agency capacity that are\nbeneficially owned by third parties or (ii)\nheld, directly or\nindirectly, by Discover or Capital One in\nrespect of debts previously contracted)) or\notherwise.\n\nPJT Partners\u0092 opinion was\nnecessarily based upon economic, market,\nmonetary, regulatory and other conditions as\nthey existed and could be evaluated, and the\ninformation made available to PJT Partners, as\nof the date of the opinion. PJT Partners\nassumed no responsibility for\nupdating or revising its opinion based on\ncircumstances or events occurring after the\ndate of its opinion. PJT Partners expressed no\nopinion as to the prices\n\n76\n\nor trading ranges at which Discover common\nstock or Capital One common stock would trade\nat any time, as to the potential effects of\nvolatility in the credit, financial and stock\nmarkets on\nDiscover, Capital One or the mergers or as to\nthe impact of the mergers on the solvency or\nviability of Discover or Capital One or the\nability of Discover or Capital One to pay its\nobligations when they come due.\n\nThe issuance of PJT Partners\u0092 opinion was\napproved by a fairness committee of PJT\nPartners in accordance with established\nprocedures. PJT\nPartners\u0092 opinion was provided to the Discover\nboard of directors, in its capacity as such,\nin connection with and for the purposes of its\nevaluation of the mergers only and was not a\nrecommendation as to any action the Discover\nboard of\ndirectors should take with respect to the\nmergers or any aspect thereof. PJT Partners\u0092\nopinion did not constitute a recommendation to\nany holder of Discover common stock (excluding\nthe shares of Discover common stock owned by\nDiscover or\nCapital One (in each case excluding the shares\nof Discover common stock (i) held in trust\naccounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and\nthe like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or\nagency capacity that are beneficially owned by\nthird parties or\n(ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Discover\nor Capital One in respect of debts previously\ncontracted)) or any other stockholder of\nDiscover as to how any stockholder should vote\nor act with respect to the mergers or any\nother matter.\n\nSummary of Financial Analyses\n\nIn\nconnection with rendering its opinion, PJT\nPartners performed certain financial,\ncomparative and other analyses as summarized\nbelow. In arriving at its opinion, PJT\nPartners did not ascribe a specific range of\nvalues to the shares of Discover common\nstock but rather made its determination as to\nfairness, from a financial point of view, to\nthe holders of Discover common stock\n(excluding the shares of Discover common stock\nowned by Discover or Capital One (in each case\nexcluding the shares of\nDiscover common stock (i) held in trust\naccounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and\nthe like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or\nagency capacity that are beneficially owned by\nthird parties or (ii) held, directly or\nindirectly, by\nDiscover or Capital One in respect of debts\npreviously contracted)) of the exchange ratio\nin the mergers on the basis of various\nfinancial and comparative analyses. The\npreparation of a fairness opinion is a complex\nprocess and involves various\ndeterminations as to the most appropriate and\nrelevant methods of financial and comparative\nanalyses and the application of those methods\nto the particular circumstances. Therefore, a\nfairness opinion is not readily susceptible to\nsummary\ndescription.\n\nIn arriving at its opinion, PJT Partners did\nnot attribute any particular weight to any\nsingle analysis or factor considered\nby it but rather made qualitative judgments as\nto the significance and relevance of each\nanalysis and factor relative to all other\nanalyses and factors performed and considered\nby it and in the context of the circumstances\nof the merger.\nAccordingly, PJT Partners believes that its\nanalyses must be considered as a whole, as\nconsidering any portion of such analyses and\nfactors, without considering all analyses and\nfactors as a whole, could create a misleading\nor incomplete view of the\nprocess underlying its opinion.\n\nThe following is a summary of the material\nfinancial analyses used by PJT Partners in\npreparing its\nopinion to the Discover board of directors.\nCertain financial analyses summarized below\ninclude information presented in tabular\nformat. In order to fully understand the\nfinancial analyses used by PJT Partners, the\ntables must be read together with\nthe text of each summary, as the tables alone\ndo not constitute a complete description of\nthe financial analyses. In performing its\nanalyses, PJT Partners made numerous\nassumptions with respect to industry\nperformance, general business and economic\nconditions and other matters, many of which\nare beyond the control of Discover and Capital\nOne. None of Discover, Capital One, PJT\nPartners, or any other person assumes\nresponsibility if future results are\nmaterially different from those discussed.\nAny estimates contained in these analyses are\nnot necessarily indicative of actual values or\npredictive of future results or values, which\nmay be significantly more or less favorable\nthan as set forth below. In addition, analyses\nrelating to the\nvalue of the businesses do not purport to be\nappraisals or reflect the prices at which the\nbusinesses may actually be sold. The financial\nanalyses summarized below were based on the\nProjections and Synergy Estimates and other\nfinancial information\nprepared by the management of Discover (or, in\nthe case of the Synergy Estimates, the\nmanagement of Capital One) and furnished to\nPJT Partners by or on behalf of the management\nof Discover, and used at the direction of the\nmanagement of Discover and\napproved for PJT Partners\u0092 use, in the case of\nthe Projections and\n\n77\n\nother financial information, by the Discover\nboard of directors, and in the case of the\nSynergy Estimates, by the management of\nDiscover. The following summary does not\npurport to be a complete description of the\nfinancial analyses performed by PJT Partners.\nThe following quantitative information, to the\nextent that it is based on market data, is\nbased on market data as it existed, for\nDiscover and Capital One, based on the closing\ntrading price on February 16, 2024 (which\nrepresented the last trading day for Discover\ncommon stock and Capital One common stock\nprior to the date of PJT Partners\u0092 opinion),\nand is not necessarily indicative of current\nor future market conditions. Fully diluted\nshare numbers for Discover and Capital One\nused below were provided by, and used at the\ndirection of, Discover\u0092s management. Selected\nComparable Company Analysis \u0096 Discover PJT\nPartners reviewed and compared specific\nfinancial, operating and public trading data\nrelating to Discover with selected publicly\ntraded (i) credit card and consumer-focused\nbanks and (ii) regional banks that PJT\nPartners deemed comparable to Discover. The\nselected comparable companies (which we refer\nto collectively as the \u0093Discover Peers\u0094) for\n(i) the credit card and consumer-focused banks\nwere American Express Company, Ally Financial,\nCapital One and Synchrony Financial and (ii)\nthe regional banks were Citizens Financial\nGroup, Inc., Fifth Third Bancorp, First\nCitizens Bancshares, Inc., Huntington\nBancshares Incorporated, KeyCorp, M&T Bank\nCorporation and Regions Financial Corporation.\nPJT Partners reviewed and compared such data\nin order to assess how the public market\nvalues shares of similar publicly traded\ncompanies and to provide a range of relative\nimplied equity values per share of Discover\ncommon stock on a standalone basis, in each\ncase by reference to these companies. As part\nof its selected comparable company analysis,\nPJT Partners calculated and analysed certain\nratios and multiples, including: (1) stock\nprice as a multiple of calendar year 2024E\nearnings per share for each such selected\ncomparable company, which is referred to in\nthis summary of PJT Partners\u0092 opinion as \u0093P /\n2024E EPS\u0094 and (2) stock price as a multiple\nof the tangible book value per share of each\nselected comparable company\u0092s common stock as\nof such selected comparable company\u0092s most\nrecent quarter, which is referred to in this\nsummary of PJT Partners\u0092 opinion as \u0093P /\nTBVPS.\u0094 All of these calculations were\nperformed and based on publicly available\nfinancial data, market data (including share\nprices) as of the close of trading on February\n16, 2024 and consensus estimates derived from\nsell-side research. The results of this\nselected comparable company analysis are\nsummarized below:\n                                              \n          Disco\u2026    Disc\u2026                     \n          Peers\u00a0    Peers                     \n          (Cred\u2026    (Cre\u2026    Disco\u2026    Disc\u2026  \n          Card      Card     Peers     Peers  \n          and       and      (Regi\u2026    (Reg\u2026  \n          Consu\u2026    Cons\u2026    Banks)    Bank\u2026  \n          Focus\u2026    Focu\u2026                     \n          Banks)    Bank\u2026                     \n          Low       High     Low       High   \n  P /                                         \n  202\u2026    7.1x      16.5x    8.6x      11.9x  \n  EPS                                         \n  P /     1.08x     7.60x    1.02x     1.92x  \n  TBV\u2026                                        \n                                              \nPJT Partners selected the comparable companies\nlisted above because PJT Partners believed\ntheir businesses and operating profiles are\nreasonably similar to that of Discover.\nHowever, because of the inherent differences\nbetween the business, operations and prospects\nof Discover and those of the selected\ncomparable companies, PJT Partners believed\nthat it was inappropriate to, and therefore\ndid not, rely solely on the quantitative\nresults of the selected comparable company\nanalysis. Accordingly, PJT Partners also made\nqualitative judgments concerning differences\nbetween the business, financial and operating\ncharacteristics and prospects of Discover and\nthe selected comparable companies that could\naffect the public trading values of each in\norder to provide a context in which to\nconsider the results of the quantitative\nanalysis. These qualitative judgments related\nprimarily to the differing sizes, growth\nprospects, profitability levels and degree of\noperational risk between Discover and the\ncompanies included in the selected company\nanalysis. Accordingly, PJT Partners selected\n(1) a P / 2024E EPS multiple range of 8.5x to\n10.5x and (2) a P / TBVPS multiple range of\n1.80x to 2.20x, in each case for Discover on a\nstandalone basis. PJT Partners then applied\nthe applicable ranges to Discover\u0092s calendar\nyear 2024E earnings per share based on the\nDiscover Projections and 78\n\nDiscover\u0092s tangible book value per share as of\nDiscover\u0092s most recent quarter, to calculate a\nrange of implied equity values per share of\nDiscover common stock on a standalone basis\nbased on the fully diluted number of shares of\nDiscover common stock as of February 18, 2024.\nThe following summarizes the results of these\ncalculations:\n                                              \n                      Implied\u00a0equity\u00a0values\u00a0  \n                      per\u00a0share               \n                      of Discover common      \n                      stock                   \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  P / 2024E EPS    $  101.77\u00a0\u0096\u00a0$125.72         \n  P / TBVPS        $  97.27 \u0096 $118.89          \n                                              \nSelected Comparable Company Analysis \u0096 Capital\nOne PJT Partners reviewed and compared\nspecific financial, operating and public\ntrading data relating to Capital One with\nselected publicly traded (i) credit card and\nconsumer-focused banks and (ii) super-regional\nand regional banks that PJT Partners deemed\ncomparable to Capital One. The selected\ncomparable companies (which we refer to\ncollectively as the \u0093Capital One Peers\u0094) for\n(i) the credit card and consumer-focused banks\nwere American Express Company, Ally Financial,\nDiscover and Synchrony Financial and (ii) the\nsuper-regional and regional banks were\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc., Fifth Third\nBancorp, First Citizens Bancshares, Inc., M&T\nBank Corporation, Truist Financial\nCorporation, PNC Financial Services Group and\nU.S. Bancorp. PJT Partners reviewed and\ncompared such data in order to assess how the\npublic market values shares of similar\npublicly traded companies and to provide a\nrange of relative implied equity values per\nshare of Capital One common stock on a\nstandalone basis, in each case by reference to\nthese companies. As part of its selected\ncomparable company analysis, PJT Partners\ncalculated and analysed certain ratios and\nmultiples, including: (1) P / 2024E EPS and\n(2) P / TBVPS. All of these calculations were\nperformed and based on publicly available\nfinancial data, market data (including share\nprices) as of the close of trading on February\n16, 2024 and consensus estimates derived from\nsell-side research.

PJT Partners calculated\nthe low end of the implied exchange ratio\nrange by dividing the low value of Discover\nimplied equity values per share reference\nrange by the high value of the Capital One\nimplied equity values per share reference\nrange. PJT Partners calculated the high end of\nthe implied exchange ratio range by dividing\nthe high value of Discover implied equity\nvalues per share reference range by the low\nvalue of the Capital One implied equity values\nper share reference range. The result of this\nanalysis, as compared to the exchange ratio of\n1.0192x provided in the merger agreement, is\nsummarized below:\n                                           \n                   Implied\u00a0Exchange\u00a0Ratio  \n  P / 2024E EPS    0.7629x\u00a0\u0096\u00a01.1780x        \n  P / TBVPS        0.6723x \u0096 1.0361x        \n                                           \nDividend Discount Analysis \u0096 Discover In order\nto estimate the present value of Discover\ncommon stock, PJT Partners performed a\ndividend discount analysis of Discover. A\ndividend discount analysis is a traditional\nvaluation methodology used to derive a\ncompany\u0092s implied equity value per share by\ncalculating the \u0093present value\u0094 of the sum of\nall of a company\u0092s future dividendable cash\nflows available to common stockholders.\n\u0093Present value\u0094 refers to the current value of\nfuture dividends and is obtained by\ndiscounting those future dividendable cash\nflows by a discount rate that takes into\naccount macroeconomic assumptions and\nestimates of risk, the opportunity cost of\ncapital, expected returns and other\nappropriate factors. To calculate the\nestimated present value of Discover common\nstock using the dividend discount method, PJT\nPartners added (i) Discover\u0092s projected\ndividendable cash flows for the calendar years\n2024 through 2027 based on the Discover\nProjections to (ii) ranges of \u0093terminal\nvalues\u0094 of Discover as of December 31, 2027,\nand discounted such amounts to their present\nvalues using a range of selected discount\nrates. The projected dividendable cash flows\nwere calculated as the excess capital\navailable for common stockholder distribution\nbased on Discover\u0092s projected risk-weighted\nassets, target CET1 ratio and net income\napplicable to common stockholders from the\nDiscover Projections. The residual value of\nthe total divendable cash flows at the end of\nthe projection period, or \u0093terminal value,\u0094\nwas estimated by applying the exit multiple\nrange of 8.5x to 10.5x to Discover\u0092s calendar\nyear 2028E net income based on the Discover\nProjections. The range of discount rates of\n11.0% to 13.0% was selected based on PJT\nPartners\u0092 analysis of the cost of equity of\nDiscover. PJT Partners then calculated a range\nof implied equity values per share of Discover\ncommon stock by dividing the sum of the amount\nderived from (i) and (ii) above by the fully\ndiluted number of shares of Discover common\nstock as of February 18, 2024.

To\ncalculate the estimated present value of\nCapital One common stock using the dividend\ndiscount method, PJT Partners added (a)\nCapital One\u0092s projected dividendable cash\nflows for the calendar years 2024 through 2027\nbased on the Capital One Projections to (b)\nranges of \u0093terminal values\u0094 of Capital One as\nof December 31, 2027, and discounted such\namounts to their present values using a range\nof selected discount rates. The projected\ndividendable cash flows were calculated as the\nexcess capital available for common\nstockholder distribution based on Capital\nOne\u0092s projected risk-weighted assets, target\nCET1 ratio and net income applicable to common\nstockholders from the Capital One Projections.\nThe residual value of the total divendable\ncash flows at the end of the projection\nperiod, or \u0093terminal value,\u0094 was estimated by\napplying the exit multiple range of 8.0x to\n10.0x to Capital One\u0092s calendar year 2028E net\nincome based on the Capital One Projections.\nThe range of discount rates of 11.0% to 13.0%\nwas selected based on PJT Partners\u0092 analysis\nof the cost of equity of Capital One. PJT\nPartners then calculated a range of implied\nequity values per share of Capital One common\nstock by dividing the sum of the amount\nderived from (a) and (b) above by the fully\ndiluted number of shares of Capital One common\nstock as of February 18, 2024.

PJT Partners calculated the low\nend of the implied exchange ratio range by\ndividing the low value of Discover implied\nequity values per share reference range by the\nhigh value of Capital One implied equity\nvalues per share reference range. PJT Partners\ncalculated the high end of the implied\nexchange ratio range by dividing the high\nvalue of Discover implied equity values per\nshare reference range by the low value of the\nCapital One implied equity values per share\nreference range. The result of this analysis,\nas compared to the exchange ratio of 1.0192x\nprovided in the merger agreement, is\nsummarized below:\n                                              \n                         Implied\u00a0Exchange\u00a0    \n                         Ratio                \n  Dividend Discount      0.7427x\u00a0\u0096\u00a01.1296x     \n  Analysis                                    \n                                              \nGeneral The preparation of a fairness opinion\nis a complex process and is not necessarily\nsusceptible to partial analysis or summary\ndescription. Selecting portions of the\nanalyses or of the summary set forth above,\nwithout considering the analyses as a whole,\ncould create an incomplete view of the\nprocesses underlying PJT Partners\u0092 opinion. In\narriving at its fairness determination, PJT\nPartners considered the results of all of its\nanalyses and did not attribute any particular\nweight to any factor or analysis considered by\nit. Rather, PJT Partners made its\ndetermination as to fairness on the basis of\nits experience and professional judgment after\nconsidering the results of all of its\nanalyses. No company used in the above\nanalyses as a comparison is directly\ncomparable to Discover or Capital One. The\nterms of the merger agreement, including the\nexchange ratio, were determined through\narm\u0092s-lengthnegotiations between Discover and\nCapital One, rather than PJT Partners, and the\ndecision to enter into the merger agreement\nwas solely that of Discover and Capital One.\n81\n\nPJT Partners prepared these analyses for\npurposes of providing its opinion to the\nDiscover\nboard of directors as to the fairness from a\nfinancial point of view, as of the date of the\nwritten opinion of PJT Partners, of the\nexchange ratio in the mergers to the holders\nof Discover common stock (excluding the shares\nof Discover common stock\nowned by Discover or Capital One (in each case\nexcluding the shares of Discover common stock\n(i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts,\nmutual funds and the like, or otherwise held\nin a fiduciary or agency capacity that are\nbeneficially\nowned by third parties or (ii) held, directly\nor indirectly, by Discover or Capital One in\nrespect of debts previously contracted)).\nThese analyses do not purport to be appraisals\nnor do they necessarily reflect the prices at\nwhich businesses\nor securities actually may be sold. Analyses\nbased upon forecasts of future results are not\nnecessarily indicative of actual future\nresults, which may be significantly more or\nless favorable than suggested by these\nanalyses. Because these analyses\nare inherently subject to uncertainty, being\nbased upon numerous factors or events beyond\nthe control of the parties or their respective\nadvisors, none of Discover, Capital One, PJT\nPartners or any other person assumes\nresponsibility if future\nresults are materially different from those\nforecast.\n\nPJT Partners is an internationally recognized\ninvestment banking firm and, as part\nof its investment banking activities, is\nregularly engaged in the valuation of\nbusinesses and their securities in connection\nwith mergers and acquisitions, investments for\npassive and control purposes, negotiated\nunderwritings, competitive bids,\nsecondary distributions of listed and unlisted\nsecurities, private placements and valuations\nfor estate, corporate and other purposes.\nDiscover selected PJT Partners to act as its\nfinancial advisor because of its\nqualifications, reputation and\nexperience in the valuation of businesses and\nsecurities in connection with mergers and\nacquisitions generally and in the financial\nservices sector specifically.\n\nPJT Partners is acting as financial advisor to\nDiscover in connection with the mergers. As\ncompensation for its services in connection\nwith\nthe mergers, PJT Partners is entitled to\nreceive from Discover an aggregate fee of $48\nmillion, $10 million of which became payable\nupon the delivery of PJT Partners\u0092 opinion to\nthe Discover board of directors and the\nremainder of\nwhich is contingent and payable upon the\nconsummation of the mergers. Discover has\nagreed to reimburse PJT Partners for out-of-\npocket expenses and to indemnify PJT\nPartners for certain liabilities arising out\nof the performance of such services (including\nthe rendering of PJT Partners\u0092 opinion).\n\nIn the ordinary course of PJT Partners and its\naffiliates\u0092 businesses, PJT Partners and its\naffiliates may provide investment banking and\nother financial services to Discover, Capital\nOne or their respective affiliates and may\nreceive compensation for the rendering of\nthese services. During the two (2) years\npreceding the date of its opinion, PJT\nPartners (i) has not advised\nor received compensation from Discover and\n(ii) advised a creditor group in which Capital\nOne was a member, for which PJT Partners\nreceived fees paid by a third party.\n\nCertain Unaudited Prospective Financial\nInformation\n\nCapital One and Discover do not, as a matter\nof course, publicly disclose forecasts or\ninternal projections as to their respective\nfuture\nperformance, revenues, earnings, financial\ncondition or other results given, among other\nreasons, the inherent uncertainty of the\nunderlying assumptions and estimates, other\nthan, in the case of Discover from time to\ntime, estimated ranges of\ncertain expected financial measures for the\ncurrent year and certain future years in\nregular earnings conference calls, investor\nconference presentations, press releases and\nother investor materials.\n\nHowever, Capital One and Discover are\nincluding in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus certain unaudited\nprospective financial information\n(which we refer to collectively as the\n\u0093prospective financial information\u0094), with\nrespect to Capital One and Discover on a\nstandalone basis and without giving effect to\nthe mergers (except as expressly set forth\nbelow in the section\nentitled \u0093\u0097Certain Estimated Synergies\nAttributable to the Mergers\u0094). A summary of\ncertain significant elements of this\ninformation is set forth below and is included\nin this joint proxy statement/prospectus\nsolely for the\npurpose of providing Capital One stockholders\nand Discover stockholders\n\n82\n\naccess to certain nonpublic information made\navailable to Capital One and Discover and\ntheir respective boards of directors and\nfinancial advisors.\n\nNeither Capital One nor Discover endorses the\nprospective financial information as\nnecessarily predictive of actual future\nresults.\nFurthermore, although presented with numerical\nspecificity, the prospective financial\ninformation reflects numerous estimates and\nassumptions made by Capital One\u0092s senior\nmanagement, Discover\u0092s senior management or\nWall Street research\nanalysts, as applicable, at the time such\nprospective financial information, as\napplicable, was prepared or approved for use\nby the financial advisors in connection with\nthe financial advisors\u0092 respective financial\nanalyses and opinions as\ndescribed in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus under \u0093\u0097Opinion of\nCapital One\u0092s Financial Advisor\u0094 and \u0093\u0097Opinion\nof Discover\u0092s Financial Advisor.\u0094 The\nprospective financial information\nrepresents, as applicable, Capital One\u0092s\nsenior management\u0092s evaluation, Discover\u0092s\nsenior management\u0092s evaluation or Wall Street\nresearch analysts\u0092 evaluation, of Capital\nOne\u0092s expected future financial performance on\na standalone basis or Discover\u0092s expected\nfuture financial performance on a standalone\nbasis, as applicable, without reference to the\nmergers (except as expressly set forth in the\nsection entitled \u0093\u0097Certain Estimated Synergies\nAttributable to the Mergers\u0094). In addition,\nsince the prospective financial information\ncovers multiple years, such information by its\nnature becomes subject to greater uncertainty\nwith each successive year.

There can be no assurance that the\nunderlying assumptions or projected\nresults will be realized, and actual results\ncould differ materially from those reflected\nin the prospective financial information,\nwhether or not the mergers are completed.\nFurther, these assumptions do not include all\npotential actions that the\nsenior management of Capital One or Discover\ncould or might have taken during these time\nperiods. The inclusion in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus of the prospective\nfinancial information below should not be\nregarded as an indication that\nCapital One, Discover or their respective\nboards of directors or advisors considered, or\nnow consider, this prospective financial\ninformation to be material information to any\nCapital One stockholders or Discover\nstockholders, as the case may be,\nparticularly in light of the inherent risks\nand uncertainties associated with such\nprospective financial information.\n\nThe prospective\nfinancial information should not be construed\nas financial guidance, and it should not be\nrelied on as such. This information was\nprepared solely for internal use and is\nsubjective in many respects and thus is\nsusceptible to multiple interpretations\nand periodic revisions based on actual\nexperience and business developments.

Except as expressly set\nforth below in the section entitled \u0093\u0097Certain\nEstimated Synergies Attributable to the\nMergers\u0094, the prospective financial\ninformation does not take into account the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement or the possible financial and other\neffects on Capital One or Discover\nof the mergers, and does not attempt to\npredict or suggest actual future results of\nCapital One following the completion of the\nmergers or give effect to the mergers,\nincluding the effect of negotiating or\nexecuting the merger agreement, the costs\nthat may be incurred in connection with\nconsummating the mergers, the potential\nsynergies that may be achieved by Capital One\nas a result of the mergers (except as\nexpressly set forth below in the section\nentitled \u0093\u0097Certain Estimated Synergies\nAttributable to the Mergers\u0094), the effect on\nCapital One or Discover of any business or\nstrategic decision or action that has been or\nwill be taken as a result of the merger\nagreement having been executed, or the effect\nof any\nbusiness or strategic decisions or actions\nwhich would\n\n83\n\nlikely have been taken if the merger agreement\nhad not been executed, but which were instead\naltered, accelerated, postponed or not taken\nin anticipation of the mergers. Further, the\nprospective financial information does not\ntake into account the effect of any possible\nfailure of the mergers to occur. The\nprospective financial information does not\ntake into account any circumstances or events\nthat have occurred after the date it was\nprepared and no assurances can be given that\nif the prospective financial information and\nthe underlying assumptions had been prepared\nas of the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, similar assumptions\nwould be used.

Owen (the \u0093Owen\nRSU award\u0094) in recognition of his service\nas Discover\u0092s interim chief executive officer\nand president from August 2023 to February 1,\n2024. The existing terms of the Owen RSU award\nprovide that the award was fully vested on the\ngrant date and, upon a \u0093change in control,\u0094\nthe Discover RSUs subject to the award will be\nsettled in shares of Discover common stock.\nThe effective time will constitute a change in\ncontrol for purposes of the Owen RSU award.\n\nNon-EmployeeDirector Discover RSU Awards\n\nEach Discover RSU award granted to Discover\u0092s\nnon-employee directors (collectively, the\n\u0093Discover director awards\u0094) provides that,\nupon a \u0093change in control,\u0094 the Discover\ndirector awards will fully vest and be settled\nin shares of Discover common stock. The\neffective time will constitute a change in\ncontrol for\npurposes of the Discover director awards.\n\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be\npayable to each of Discover\u0092s named executive\nofficers in respect of their unvested Discover\nequity awards upon a qualifying termination at\nthe effective time of the mergers, see the\nsection entitled \u0093Quantification of Payments\nand Benefits to Discover\u0092s Named Executive\nOfficers\u0094 beginning on page 91.

Owen and Shepherd, who are included in\nthe section entitled \u0093 Quantification of\nPayments and Benefits to Discover\u0092s Named\nExecutive Officers\u0094 beginning on page 91, but\nincluding Discover\u0092s three non-\nemployeedirectors who were not renominated at\nDiscover\u0092s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders\nand will not be directors at the effective\ntime) in respect of their unvested Discover\ndirector awards at the effective time of the\nmergers is $2,256,642. Discover Change in\nControl Severance Policy Discover maintains\nthe Discover Financial Services Change in\nControl Severance Policy (the \u0093CIC severance\npolicy\u0094) in which all current executive\nofficers participate, excluding Mr. Shepherd.\nThe CIC severance policy provides \u0093double-\ntrigger\u0094 severance payments and benefits to\nparticipants in the event of an involuntary\ntermination by Discover without \u0093cause,\u0094 a\nvoluntary termination of employment by a\nparticipant for \u0093good reason,\u0094 or a\ntermination due to death or \u0093disability,\u0094 each\nwithin six (6) months prior to or twenty-four\n(24) months after a \u0093change in control\u0094 (each\nas defined in the CIC severance policy, and\neach of which we refer to as a \u0093qualifying\ntermination\u0094). The effective time will\nconstitute a change in control for purposes of\nthe CIC severance policy. In the event of a\nqualifying termination, each executive officer\nis entitled to receive the following severance\npayments and benefits, in exchange for a\nrelease of claims:\n                                              \n      a lump sum cash payment equal to one    \n      and one-half (1.5) times the sum of     \n      the executive officer\u0092s annual base      \n      salary and the average cash bonus paid  \n      to the executive officer with respect   \n      to the three (3)\u00a0immediately preceding  \n      years or, if lesser, the number of      \n      years the executive officer has been    \n      employed by                             \n      Discover;                               \n                                              \n                                              \n      a lump sum cash payment equal to a      \n      pro-rata cash bonus for the year in     \n      which the qualifying termination        \n      occurs, based on the executive          \n      officer\u0092s target cash bonus for the      \n      year in which the termination occurs    \n      and a ratio of the number of days       \n      elapsed during such year prior to the   \n      termination to three hundred            \n      sixty-five (365);                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      if the executive officer timely elects  \n      continued group health coverage under   \n      the Consolidated Omnibus Budget         \n      Reconciliation Act of 1986 (\u0093COBRA\u0094), a   \n      lump sum cash payment equal to the      \n      difference between COBRA premiums and   \n      active employee premiums for            \n      twenty-four (24)\u00a0months of coverage;    \n                                              \n                                              \n      full vesting of all outstanding         \n      equity-based awards as of the later of  \n      the effective date of the change in     \n      control or the qualifying termination,  \n      unless accelerated vesting in the       \n      event of a change in control is         \n      precluded under the applicable award    \n      agreements; and                         \n                                              \n                                              \n      outplacement services for a period of   \n      twenty-four (24)\u00a0months.                \n                                              \nIn addition, in the event of a qualifying\ntermination, each executive officer will be\ngiven the opportunity to enter into a non-\ncompetitionagreement with Discover to refrain\nfrom \u0093competitive activity\u0094 for eighteen (18)\nmonths following the termination. If an\nexecutive officer enters into such agreement,\nthey will be entitled to receive an additional\namount equal to one and one-half(1.5) times\nthe sum of the executive officer\u0092s annual base\nsalary and the average cash bonus paid to the\nexecutive officer with respect to the three\n(3) immediately preceding years or, if lesser,\nthe number of years the executive officer has\nbeen employed by Discover, payable in\nsubstantially equal installments consistent\nwith Discover\u0092s executive payroll practice. An\nexecutive officer will be entitled to\nreasonable legal fees and related expenses if\nthe executive officer files a claim in\naccordance with Discover\u0092s internal review\nprocedure or commences litigation and, as a\nresult, becomes entitled to receive benefits\nin an amount greater than prior to such claim\nor litigation. Prior to the effective time,\nDiscover is permitted to amend the CIC\nseverance policy to provide that all severance\nentitlements described above as utilizing \u0093the\naverage cash bonus paid to the executive\nofficer with 89\n\nrespect to the three (3) immediately preceding\nyears or, if lesser, the number of years the\nexecutive officer has been employed by\nDiscover\u0094 instead utilize the greater of (i)\nthe\nexecutive officer\u0092s target cash bonus for the\nyear of termination or (ii) such average. The\nestimated quantifications in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus assume that Discover does\nso amend the CIC severance policy.\n\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be\npayable to each of Discover\u0092s named executive\nofficers upon a qualifying termination at the\neffective time of the mergers under the CIC\nseverance policy, see the section entitled\n\u0093Quantification of Payments and Benefits to\nDiscover\u0092s Named Executive Officers\u0094 beginning\non page 91. Based on\nthe same assumptions set forth in such\nsection, the estimated aggregate amount that\nwould be payable to the five (5) Discover\nexecutive officers who are not named executive\nofficers upon a qualifying termination at the\neffective time of the\nmergers under the CIC severance policy is\n$21,517,664, based on current base salary and\nthe greater of (i) the executive officer\u0092s\ncurrent target cash bonus or (ii) the average\ncash bonus paid to the executive officer with\nrespect to\nthe three (3) immediately preceding years or,\nif lesser, the number of years the executive\nofficer has been employed by Discover.\n\nDiscover Letter Agreement with J. Michael\nShepherd\n\nDiscover is party to a letter agreement with\nJ. Michael Shepherd, dated as of\nMarch 27, 2024 (the \u0093Shepherd letter\nagreement\u0094), pursuant to which Mr. Shepherd\ncommenced service as Discover\u0092s interim chief\nexecutive officer and president on April 1,\n2024. Pursuant to the terms of the Shepherd\nletter agreement, Mr. Shepherd was granted a\nDiscover RSU award, as described above under\n\u0093\u0097J. Michael Shepherd Discover RSU Award\u0094. Mr.\nShepherd is not eligible to participate in the\nCIC severance plan and is not\nentitled to severance payments pursuant to the\nShepherd letter agreement.\n\nFor an estimate of the amounts that would be\npayable to\nMr.\nShepherd at the effective time of the mergers\nunder the Shepherd letter agreement, see the\nsection entitled \u0093Quantification of Payments\nand Benefits to Discover\u0092s Named Executive\nOfficers\u0094 beginning on page 91.\n\nDiscover Letter Agreements with Michael G.\nRhodes\n\nDiscover is party to a letter agreement with\nMichael G. Rhodes, dated as of December 7,\n2023, pursuant to which Mr. Rhodes commenced\nemployment as Discover\u0092s chief executive\nofficer and president on February 1, 2024 and\na second letter agreement with Mr. Rhodes,\ndated as of March 27, 2024, in connection with\nhis resignation. Mr. Rhodes ceased serving as\nDiscover\u0092s chief executive officer and\npresident and as a director effective April 1,\n2024 and will serve as an advisor to the\ninterim chief executive officer until April\n12, 2024. Mr. Rhodes will not receive\nseverance in\nconnection with his resignation and his\nunvested equity awards will be forfeited in\naccordance with their terms. Accordingly, no\namounts will be payable to Mr. Rhodes at the\neffective time of the mergers.\n\nApplication of Section 280G of the Code\n\nDiscover has always sought to cultivate a\ntalented workforce, and in recent years the\ncompany succeeded in attracting several new\nkey\nexecutives. Seven (7) of Discover\u0092s current\nexecutive officers joined the company within\nthe last five (5) years. As a result of these\nexecutive officers\u0092 relatively short tenure\nwith Discover, their \u0093base amounts\u0094 (within\nthe meaning of Section 280G of the Code) will\ngenerally be smaller than if they had worked\nat Discover for a longer period of time prior\nto the effective time, likely resulting in\nhigher excise taxes under Section 4999 of the\nCode.\n\nIn light of these considerations, Discover is\npermitted to enter into agreements with its\nexecutive officers prior to the effective time\nof\nthe mergers providing for reimbursements,\nsubject to an aggregate cap not to exceed\n$25,000,000 for all impacted employees and\nindividual caps to be set forth in such\nagreements and other limitations, for excise\ntaxes incurred under\nSection 4999 of the Code in connection with\nthe mergers, so that on a\n\n90\n\nnet after-tax basis such executive officer\nwould be in the same position as though such\nexcise tax did not apply. The actual amount of\nthe excise tax\nreimbursement for each executive officer, if\nany, will not be determinable until after the\neffective time of the mergers. As of the date\nof this joint proxy statement/prospectus,\nDiscover has not yet entered into any such\nagreement and has not yet\ndetermined the individuals with whom it will\nenter into such agreements.\n\nRetention Program\n\nDiscover\u0092s ability to retain and motivate its\nemployees during the period before the\neffective time will be critical to the success\nof the\nmergers. In light of this consideration, prior\nto the effective time of the mergers, Discover\nis permitted to implement a cash retention\nprogram. Certain of Discover\u0092s executive\nofficers may be eligible to participate in\nthis retention program.\nAwards under the retention program will vest\nfifty percent (50%) on the closing date and\nfifty percent (50%) on the six (6)-month\nanniversary of the closing date, subject to\nthe participant\u0092s continued employment through\nthe applicable vesting\ndate. Awards under the retention program are\npermitted to provide for full vesting upon an\ninvoluntary termination without \u0093cause,\u0094 a\nvoluntary termination for \u0093good reason\u0094 (each\nto be defined in the applicable retention\nagreement) or a termination due to death or\ndisability, in each case on or after the\nclosing date and subject to an effective\nrelease of claims. As of the date of this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus, Discover has\nnot yet determined the\nparticipants in the retention program or\ngranted any retention awards to its executive\nofficers.\n\nAnnual Bonus\n\nIf the effective time of the mergers occurs on\nor after January 1, 2025 or prior to the date\nbonuses in respect of the 2024 fiscal year\nwould be paid in the ordinary course, any\nexecutive officer who is terminated without\n\u0093cause\u0094 or resigns for \u0093good reason\u0094 (each as\ndefined in the CIC severance policy) prior to\nthe payment date will be paid their annual\ncash\nbonus in respect of the 2024 fiscal year based\non actual performance, subject to the\neffectiveness of a release of claims and\nwithout duplication of any bonus for the same\nperiod of service under any Discover benefit\nor compensation plan.\n\n\u0093Good Reason\u0094 Acknowledgement and Transition\nor New Arrangements with Capital One\n\nDiscover is permitted to enter into\nacknowledgements with each of its named\nexecutive officers who are currently employed,\nexcluding\nMr. Shepherd, and one of its current executive\nofficers who is not a named executive officer\nthat acknowledge that such executive officers\nwill have \u0093good reason\u0094 upon or following the\neffective time of the mergers under the CIC\nseverance policy. However, any of Discover\u0092s\nexecutive officers who become officers,\ndirectors or employees or who otherwise are\nretained to provide services to Capital One,\nthe surviving entity or any of their\naffiliates and do not terminate\nemployment at or following the effective time\nof the mergers may enter into new\nindividualized compensation arrangements and\nmay participate in cash or equity incentive or\nother benefit plans maintained by Capital One\nand its affiliates. As of the\ndate of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,\nno such acknowledgements or new compensation\narrangements have been entered into with\nDiscover or Capital One, respectively.\n\nIndemnification; Directors\u0092 and Officers\u0092\nInsurance\n\nPursuant to the merger agreement, Discover\u0092s\ndirectors and officers will be entitled to\ncontinued indemnification and insurance\ncoverage\nthrough the surviving entity for acts or\nomissions occurring at or prior to the\neffective time. For a more detailed\ndescription, see the section entitled \u0093The\nMerger Agreement\u0097Covenants and\nAgreements\u0097Director and Officer\nIndemnification and Insurance\u0094 beginning on\npage 115.\n\nQuantification of Payments and Benefits to\nDiscover\u0092s Named Executive Officers\n\nThis section sets forth the information\nrequired by Item 402(t) of the SEC\u0092s\nRegulation S-K regarding compensation for each\nnamed executive officer of Discover that is\nbased on, or otherwise relates to, the\nmergers.\n\n91\n\nThis compensation is referred to as \u0093golden\nparachute\u0094 compensation by the applicable SEC\ndisclosure rules, and in this section such\nterm is used to describe the merger-related\ncompensation payable to Discover\u0092s named\nexecutive officers. The \u0093golden parachute\u0094\ncompensation payable to these individuals is\nsubject to a non-bindingadvisory vote of\nDiscover stockholders, as described in the\nsection entitled \u0093 Proposal 2: Discover\nCompensation Proposal\u0094 beginning on page 50.\nThe table below sets forth, for the purposes\nof this golden parachute disclosure, the\namount of payments and benefits (on a pre-\ntaxbasis) that each of Discover\u0092s named\nexecutive officers would receive, using the\nfollowing assumptions:\n                                              \n      the effective time will occur on April  \n      18, 2024 (which is the assumed date     \n      solely for the purposes of this         \n      golden parachute compensation           \n      disclosure);                            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n      each named executive officer will       \n      experience a qualifying termination as  \n      of the effective time;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      each named executive officer\u0092s base      \n      salary, target cash bonus and           \n      outstanding equity awards will remain   \n      unchanged from those in place as of     \n      April\u00a018, 2024;                         \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n      each named executive officer who is     \n      currently employed, excluding Mr.\u00a0      \n      Shepherd, elects to enter into a        \n      non-competition agreement under the     \n      CIC severance policy and agrees to      \n      refrain from competitive activity for   \n      eighteen (18)\u00a0months;                   \n                                              \n                                              \n      the price per share of Discover common  \n      stock at the effective time of the      \n      mergers is $121.77 (the average         \n      closing                                 \n      market price over the first five (5)\u00a0   \n      business days following the first       \n      public announcement of the mergers on   \n      February\u00a019, 2024, as required by Item  \n      402(t) of Regulation S-K); and          \n                                              \n                                              \n      for purposes of the unvested Discover   \n      PSU awards set forth in the tables,     \n      achievement at the target level of      \n      performance.                            \n                                              \nThe calculations in the tables below do not\ninclude amounts that Discover\u0092s named\nexecutive officers were already entitled to\nreceive or vested in as of the date of this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus.

Subject to the terms of the\nmerger agreement, Capital One and Discover\nhave agreed to cooperate with each other and\nuse reasonable best efforts to promptly\nprepare and file all necessary\ndocumentation to effect all applications,\nnotices, petitions and filings (and in the\ncase of the applications, notices, petitions\nand filings in respect of the requisite\nregulatory approvals, use their reasonable\nbest efforts to make such filings\nwithin thirty (30) days of the date of the\nmerger agreement), to obtain as promptly as\npracticable all permits, consents, approvals\nand authorizations of all third parties and\ngovernmental entities which are necessary or\nadvisable to consummate\nthe transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement (including the mergers and the bank\nmerger), to comply with the terms and\nconditions of all such permits, consents,\napprovals and authorizations of all such\ngovernmental entities, and to contest,\ndefend and appeal any action or proceeding by\na governmental entity (other than a bank\nregulatory agency), whether judicial or\nadministrative, challenging the merger\nagreement or the consummation of the mergers\nand the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement. These approvals include,\namong others, the approval of the Federal\nReserve Board and the OCC. Nothing in the\nmerger agreement will be deemed to require\nCapital One or Discover or any of their\nrespective subsidiaries, and\nneither Capital One nor Discover nor any of\ntheir respective subsidiaries will be\npermitted (without the written consent of the\nother party), to take any action, or commit to\ntake any action, or agree to any condition or\nrestriction, in connection\nwith obtaining permits, consents, approvals\nand authorizations of governmental entities\nthat would reasonably be expected to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the surviving\nentity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,\nafter giving effect to the\nmergers (a \u0093materially burdensome regulatory\ncondition\u0094).\n\nThe approval of an application means only that\nthe statutory and\nregulatory criteria for approval have been\nsatisfied or waived. It does not mean that the\napproving authority has determined that the\nconsideration to be received by Discover\nstockholders in the first merger is fair.\nRegulatory approval does not\nconstitute an endorsement or recommendation of\nthe mergers.\n\nCapital One and Discover believe that they\nwill be able to obtain all\nrequisite regulatory approvals. However, there\ncan be no assurance that all of the regulatory\napprovals described below will be obtained\nand, if obtained, there can be no assurances\nregarding the timing of the approvals, the\ncompanies\u0092 ability\nto obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms\nor the absence of litigation challenging such\napprovals. In addition, there can be no\nassurance that such approvals will not impose\nconditions or requirements that, individually\nor in the aggregate,\nwould or could reasonably be expected to have\nan adverse effect on the financial condition,\nresults of operations, assets or business of\nthe surviving entity following completion of\nthe mergers. There can likewise be no\nassurances that U.S. federal\nor state regulatory or competition authorities\nwill not attempt to challenge the mergers or,\nif such a challenge is made, what the result\nof such challenge will be.\n\nThe term \u0093requisite regulatory approvals\u0094\nrefers to all regulatory authorizations,\nconsents, orders and approvals (and the\nexpiration or termination of all statutory\nwaiting periods in respect thereof) from the\nFederal Reserve Board, the OCC or as otherwise\nset forth in the merger agreement that are\nnecessary to consummate the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger\nagreement, including the mergers and the bank\nmerger, or those the failure of which to be\nobtained would reasonably be expected to have,\nindividually or in the aggregate, a material\nadverse effect on the surviving entity.\n\nFederal Reserve Board\n\nThe mergers are\nsubject to approval by the Federal Reserve\nBoard pursuant to sections 3 and 4(c)(8) of\nthe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as\namended (the \u0093BHC Act\u0094). The Federal Reserve\nBoard takes into consideration a number of\nfactors when acting on\napplications under section 3 of the BHC Act.\nThese factors include the financial and\nmanagerial resources of the companies and\nbanks involved (including consideration of the\ncapital adequacy, liquidity, and earnings\nperformance, as well as the\ncompetence, experience and integrity of the\nofficers, directors and principal\nstockholders, and the records of compliance\nwith applicable laws and\n\n95\n\nregulations) and future prospects of the\nsurviving entity. The Federal Reserve Board\nalso considers the effectiveness of the\napplicant in combatting money laundering, the\nconvenience and needs of\nthe communities to be served, as well as the\nextent to which the proposal would result in\ngreater or more concentrated risks to the\nstability of the U.S. banking or financial\nsystem.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board may not approve an\napplication that would substantially lessen\ncompetition or tend to create a monopoly\nunless the\nFederal Reserve Board finds that any\nanticompetitive effects of the proposed\ntransaction are clearly outweighed in the\npublic interest by the probable effect of the\nproposal in meeting the convenience and needs\nof the communities to be served. In\nevaluating the potential competitive effects\nof a proposed transaction, the Federal Reserve\nBoard consults with the Department of Justice\n(the \u0093DOJ\u0094), and upon request, the DOJ will\nprepare a competitive factors report for the\nFederal\nReserve Board\u0092s consideration.\n\nIn considering an application under section 3\nof the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board also\nreviews\nthe records of performance of the relevant\ninsured depository institutions under the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (the \u0093CRA\u0094),\npursuant to which the Federal Reserve Board\nmust also take into account the record of\nperformance of each of\nCapital One and Discover in meeting the credit\nneeds of the entire community, including low-\nand moderate-income neighborhoods, served by\ntheir depository institution subsidiaries. In\ntheir most recent CRA\nperformance evaluations, Capital One\u0092s wholly\nowned subsidiary, Capital One Bank, received\nan overall regulatory rating of \u0093Outstanding\u0094\nand Discover\u0092s wholly owned subsidiary,\nDiscover Bank, received an overall regulatory\nrating\nof \u0093Satisfactory.\u0094\n\nIn addition, in connection with an interstate\nmerger transaction, the Federal Reserve Board\nconsiders\ncertain additional factors under the Riegle-\nNeal Interstate Banking and Branching\nEfficiency Act of 1994 (the \u0093Riegle-Neal\nAct\u0094), including the capital position of the\nacquiring bank holding company, relevant state\nlaw regarding the\nminimum age of the bank to be acquired, the\nconcentration of deposits on a nationwide and\nstatewide basis, and compliance with any\napplicable state community reinvestment and\nantitrust laws.\n\nIn considering a notification under section\n4(c)(8) of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve\nconsiders whether the proposed transaction can\nreasonably be expected to produce benefits to\nthe public that outweigh possible adverse\neffects, such as undue concentration of\nresources, decreased or unfair competition,\nconflicts of interest, unsound banking\npractices or risk to the stability of\nthe United States banking or financial system.\nAs part of its consideration of these factors,\nthe Federal Reserve also reviews the financial\nand managerial resources of the companies\ninvolved, the effect of the proposal on\ncompetition in the\nrelevant markets and the public benefits of\nthe proposal.\n\nThe filing of the application under Section 3\nof the BHC Act and the\nnotification under Section 4 of the BHC Act to\nthe Federal Reserve Board occurred on or about\nMarch 20, 2024.\n\nAt any time, the\nDOJ, private persons or state attorneys\ngeneral could bring an action challenging the\nproposed transaction pursuant to applicable\nantitrust laws. A challenge by the DOJ after\nreceipt of approval by the Federal Reserve\nBoard but prior to the\nstatutory waiting period applicable to the\nFederal Reserve Board\u0092s approval lapsing would\nautomatically stay the effectiveness of such\nan approval unless a court specifically\nordered otherwise.\n\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n\nThe merger of Discover Bank with and into\nCapital One Bank requires the prior approval\nof the OCC under the National Bank Act, the\nBank Merger\nAct, and the Riegle-Neal Act. In evaluating\nthe application, the OCC will consider: (i)\nthe financial and managerial resources of the\nbanks party to the bank merger and the future\nprospects of the surviving entity, (ii) the\nconvenience and\nneeds of the community to be served and the\nrecord of the banks under the CRA, including\ntheir CRA ratings, (iii) the banks\u0092\neffectiveness in combating money-laundering\nactivities, and (iv) the extent to which the\nproposal would\nresult in greater or more concentrated risks\nto the stability of the U.S. banking or\nfinancial system.\n\n96\n\nAdditionally, the OCC considers the capital\nlevel of the resulting bank, the conformity of\nthe transaction to applicable law, the purpose\nof the mergers, the impact of the mergers on\nthe safety and soundness of the bank, and the\neffect on the bank\u0092s stockholders, depositors,\nother creditors and customers. In addition, in\nconnection\nwith an interstate bank merger transaction,\nsuch as the bank merger, the OCC considers\ncertain additional factors under the Riegle-\nNeal Act, including the capital position of\nthe acquiring bank, relevant state law\nregarding the minimum age of the\nbank to be acquired and compliance with any\napplicable state community reinvestment and\nantitrust laws. Under the Riegle-Neal Act, the\nOCC may approve an interstate merger\ntransaction only if each constituent bank is\nadequately capitalized at the\ntime the application for such transaction is\nfiled with the OCC, and the OCC determines\nthat the resulting bank will be well\ncapitalized and well managed upon the\nconsummation of the transaction.\n\nThe filing of the application to the OCC under\nthe National Bank Act, the Bank Merger Act and\nthe Riegle-Neal Act occurred on or about\nMarch 20, 2024.\n\nPublic Notice and Comments\n\nThe BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act and Federal\nReserve Board and OCC regulations require\npublished notice of, and the opportunity for\npublic\ncomment on, the applications to the Federal\nReserve and the OCC. These agencies take into\naccount the views of third-party commenters,\nparticularly on the subject of the merging\nparties\u0092 CRA performance and record of service\nto their\ncommunities. As part of the review process in\nmerger transactions, the Federal Reserve Board\nand OCC frequently receive protests from\ncommunity groups and others. These agencies\nare also authorized to hold one or more public\nhearings or meetings if\nthe agencies determine that such hearings or\nmeetings would be appropriate. The receipt of\nwritten comments or any public meeting or\nhearing could prolong the period during which\nthe applicable application is under review by\nthese agencies.\n\nDelaware State Bank Commissioner; Additional\nRegulatory Approvals and Notices\n\nThe merger is also subject to the approval of\nthe Delaware State Bank Commissioner. The\nfiling of the application to the Delaware\nState Bank\nCommissioner occurred on or about March 20,\n2024. Notifications and/or applications\nrequesting approval may be submitted to\nvarious other federal and state regulatory\nauthorities and self-regulatory organizations.\n\nTreatment of Discover Preferred Stock and\nDiscover Depositary Shares\n\nIn the second step merger, each share of\nDiscover series C preferred stock and Discover\nseries D preferred stock, in each case issued\nand\noutstanding immediately prior to the second\neffective time, will be converted into the\nright to receive one (1) share of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock or Capital One series\nP preferred stock, respectively. The new\nCapital One preferred\nstock will have terms that are not materially\nless favorable than the terms of the\napplicable series of Discover preferred stock.\n\nEach\noutstanding share of Discover series C\npreferred stock and Discover series D\npreferred stock is presently represented by\nDiscover depositary shares that represent a\n1/100th ownership interest in a share of the\napplicable series of Discover preferred\nstock. Upon completion of the mergers, Capital\nOne will assume the obligations of Discover\nunder the applicable deposit agreements. Each\nDiscover depositary share will then become a\nnew Capital One depositary share and\nthereafter represent a 1/100th\ninterest in a share of the applicable series\nof new Capital One preferred stock.\n\nAccounting Treatment of the Mergers\n\nCapital One and Discover prepare their\nrespective financial statements in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. The mergers will be accounted\nfor as an\nacquisition of Discover by Capital One under\nthe acquisition method of accounting, and\nCapital One will be treated as the acquirer\nfor accounting purposes.\n\n97\n\nStock Exchange Listings\n\nCapital One common stock is listed for trading\non the NYSE under the symbol \u0093COF.\u0094 Discover\ncommon stock is listed on the NYSE under\nthe symbol \u0093DFS.\u0094 After the effective time,\nthe Discover common stock currently listed on\nthe NYSE will be delisted from such exchange\nand deregistered under the Exchange Act.\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement,\nCapital One will cause the shares of Capital\nOne common stock to be issued in the first\nmerger to be\napproved for listing on the NYSE prior to the\neffective time, subject to official notice of\nissuance. The merger agreement provides that\nneither Capital One nor Discover will be\nrequired to complete the mergers if such\nshares are not authorized for\nlisting on the NYSE, subject to official\nnotice of issuance. Following the mergers,\nshares of Capital One common stock will\ncontinue to be listed on the NYSE.\n\nAppraisal or Dissenters\u0092 Rights in Connection\nwith the Mergers\n\nUnder Delaware law, Capital One stockholders\nand holders of Capital One preferred stock\nwill not be entitled to appraisal rights in\nconnection\nwith the mergers. If the mergers are\ncompleted, Capital One stockholders and\nholders of Capital One preferred stock will\nnot receive any consideration, and their\nshares of Capital One common stock or Capital\nOne preferred stock, as applicable, will\nremain outstanding.\n\nUnder Delaware law, stockholders do not have\nappraisal rights with respect to shares of any\nclass or series of stock\nif such shares of stock, or depositary\nreceipts in respect thereof, are either (i)\nlisted on a national securities exchange or\n(ii) held of record by more than 2,000\nholders, unless the stockholders receive in\nexchange for their shares\nanything other than shares of stock of the\nsurviving or resulting corporation (or\ndepositary receipts in respect thereof), or of\nany other corporation that is publicly listed\nor held by more than 2,000 holders of record,\ncash in lieu of fractional\nshares or fractional depositary receipts\ndescribed above or any combination of the\nforegoing. Because Discover common stock is\nlisted on the NYSE, a national securities\nexchange, and because Discover stockholders\nwill receive in the mergers only\nshares of Capital One common stock, which will\nbe publicly listed on the NYSE upon the\neffective time, and cash in lieu of fractional\nshares, Discover stockholders will not be\nentitled to any appraisal rights in connection\nwith the mergers.\n\nUnder Delaware law, holders of shares of\nDiscover preferred stock and beneficial owners\nare entitled to appraisal rights in connection\nwith\nthe mergers, provided that such holders meet\nall of the conditions set forth in Section 262\nof the DGCL and certain conditions described\ntherein are met. Pursuant to Section 262 of\nthe DGCL, holders of shares of Discover\npreferred stock\nand beneficial owners who comply with the\napplicable requirements of Section 262 of the\nDGCL will have the right to seek appraisal of\nthe fair value of such shares as determined by\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery if the mergers\nare completed.\nUnless the Delaware Court of Chancery, in its\ndiscretion, determines otherwise for good\ncause shown, interest on an appraisal award\nwill accrue and compound quarterly from the\neffective time through the date the judgment\nis paid at 5% over the\nFederal Reserve discount rate (including any\nsurcharge) as established from time to time\nduring such period; provided, however, that at\nany time before the Delaware Court of Chancery\nenters judgment in the appraisal proceeding,\nthe surviving entity\nmay pay to each stockholder entitled to\nappraisal an amount in cash, in which case any\nsuch interest will accrue after the time of\nsuch payment only on the amount that equals\nthe sum of (1) the difference, if any, between\nthe amount so paid and\nthe \u0093fair value\u0094 of the shares of Discover\npreferred stock as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery and (2) interest theretofore\naccrued, unless paid at such time. The\nsurviving entity is under no obligation to\nmake such\nvoluntary cash payment before such entry of\njudgment. In addition, it is possible that the\nfair value as determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery may be more or less than, or the\nsame as, the value of Capital One preferred\nstock received by\nholders of Discover preferred stock in\nconnection with the mergers. Holders of\nDiscover preferred stock and beneficial owners\nelecting to exercise appraisal rights must\ncomply with the procedures set forth in\nSection 262 of the DGCL in order to\ndemand and perfect their rights. Any holder of\nDiscover preferred stock or beneficial owner\nwishing to preserve their rights to appraisal\nmust make a demand for appraisal as described\nbelow.\n\n98\n\nComputershare Inc. and Computershare Trust\nCompany, N.A. (acting jointly as the\ndepositary for the Discover preferred stock),\nis the holder of record of the shares of\nDiscover preferred stock as of the date of\nthis joint proxy statement/prospectus.\nAccordingly, to exercise appraisal rights with\nrespect to Discover preferred stock, holders\nof Discover depositary shares will be required\nto follow the procedures provided by the\ndepositary with respect thereto. The following\nis intended as a brief summary of the material\nprovisions of Section 262 of the DGCL required\nto be followed by holders of Discover\npreferred stock or beneficial owners wishing\nto demand and perfect their appraisal rights.\nThis summary, however, is not a complete\nstatement of all applicable requirements and\nis subject to and qualified in its entirety by\nreference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full\ntext of which appears in Annex Dto this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated\nherein by reference. Unless otherwise noted\nherein, all references in this summary to\n\u0093stockholder\u0094 are to the holder of record of\nshares of Discover preferred stock, and all\nreferences to a \u0093beneficial owner\u0094 mean any\nindividual, corporation, partnership,\nunincorporated association or other entity\nthat is the beneficial owner of shares of\nDiscover preferred stock held either in voting\ntrust or by a nominee on behalf of such\nperson. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a\nmerger agreement is to be submitted for\nadoption at a meeting of stockholders, the\ncorporation, not less than twenty (20) days\nprior to the meeting, must notify each of its\nstockholders who was such on the Discover\nrecord date for notice of such meeting with\nrespect to shares for which appraisal rights\nare available that appraisal rights are\navailable and include in the notice either a\ncopy of Section 262 of the DGCL or information\ndirecting the stockholders to a publicly\navailable electronic resource at which Section\n262 of the DGCL may be accessed without\nsubscription or cost. This joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus constitutes Discover\u0092s\nnotice to the record holders and beneficial\nowners of Discover preferred stock of the\navailability of appraisal rights in connection\nwith the mergers under Section 262 of the\nDGCL, and the full text of Section 262 of the\nDGCL is set forth in Annex Dto this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated\nherein by reference. If you wish to consider\nexercising appraisal rights, you should\ncarefully review the text of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL and consult your legal advisor. If\nyou fail to timely and properly comply with\nthe requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL,\nappraisal rights may be lost. To exercise\nappraisal rights with respect to shares of\nDiscover preferred stock, record holders and\nbeneficial owners must:\n                                              \n      deliver to Discover a written demand    \n      for appraisal of such record holder\u0092s    \n      or beneficial owner\u0092s shares             \n      of Discover preferred stock before the  \n      vote is taken on the Discover merger    \n      proposal at the Special Meeting, as     \n      described further below under the       \n      section entitled \u0093\u0097Written Demand and     \n      Notice\u0094;                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      continuously hold shares of Discover    \n      preferred stock from the date of        \n      making the demand through the date the  \n      mergers are consummated;                \n                                              \n                                              \n      file a petition in the Delaware Court   \n      of Chancery requesting a determination  \n      of the fair value of such record        \n      holder\u0092s or beneficial owner\u0092s shares of  \n      Discover preferred stock within 120     \n      days after the effective date of the    \n      mergers (or another stockholder or      \n      beneficial owner seeking appraisal, or  \n      the surviving entity, must file such    \n      petition, but                           \n      the surviving entity is under no        \n      obligation to file any petition and     \n      has no intention of doing so); and      \n                                              \n                                              \n      otherwise comply with the procedures    \n      set forth in Section\u00a0262 of the DGCL.   \n                                              \nWritten Demand and Notice A demand for\nappraisal made by a holder of Discover\npreferred stock or beneficial owner must be\nexecuted by or on behalf of the holder of\nrecord or beneficial owner, as applicable, and\nmust reasonably inform Discover of the\nidentity of such stockholder or beneficial\nowner. In addition, in the case of a demand\nfor appraisal made by a beneficial owner, the\ndemand must also reasonably identify the\nholder of record of the shares for which the\n99\n\ndemand is made, be accompanied by documentary\nevidence of the beneficial owner\u0092s ownership\nof stock (such as a brokerage or securities\naccount statement containing such information\nor a\nletter from the broker or other record holder\nof such shares confirming such information)\nand a statement that such documentary evidence\nis a true and correct copy of what it purports\nto be, and provide an address at which such\nbeneficial owner\nconsents to receive notices given by the\nsurviving entity under Section 262 of the DGCL\nand to be set forth on the verified list\nrequired by subsection (f) of Section 262 of\nthe DGCL (discussed further below).\n\nWhether made by a holder of Discover preferred\nstock or a beneficial owner, a written demand\nfor appraisal must state that the person\nintends\nthereby to demand appraisal of the holder\u0092s\nshares in connection with the mergers.\n\nIf the shares of Discover preferred stock are\nowned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such\nas by a trustee, guardian or custodian,\nexecution of the demand must be made in that\ncapacity, and if the shares of Discover\npreferred stock are owned of record by more\nthan one person, as in a joint\ntenancy and tenancy in common, the demand must\nbe executed by or on behalf of all joint\nowners. An authorized agent, including an\nagent for two or more joint owners, may\nexecute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a\nholder of record or beneficial\nowner; however, the agent must identify the\nrecord owner or owners (and, if any by an\nauthorized agent of any beneficial owner or\nowners, must identify the beneficial owner or\nowners) and expressly disclose the fact that,\nin executing the demand,\nthe agent is acting as agent for such owner or\nowners. A record holder who holds shares of\nDiscover preferred stock as a nominee for\nothers may exercise his, her or its right of\nappraisal with respect to the shares of\nDiscover preferred stock held\nfor one or more beneficial owners, while not\nexercising this right for other beneficial\nowners. In that case, the written demand\nshould state the number of shares of Discover\npreferred stock as to which appraisal is\nsought. Where no number of shares\nof Discover preferred stock is expressly\nmentioned, the demand for appraisal will be\npresumed to cover all shares of Discover\npreferred stock held in the name of the record\nholder.\n\nFailure to follow the procedures set forth in\nSection 262 of the DGCL may result in the\nloss, termination or waiver of appraisal\nrights.\nIf a record holder or beneficial owner desires\nto exercise appraisal rights, such record\nholder or beneficial owner must submit to\nDiscover a written demand for payment of the\nfair value of such record holder\u0092s or\nbeneficial owner\u0092s\nDiscover preferred stock. The failure of a\nholder of Discover preferred stock or\nbeneficial owner to make such a written demand\nwill constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.\n\nAll demands for appraisal must be delivered\nto: Discover Financial Services, 2500 Lake\nCook Road, Riverwoods, IL 60015, Attn:\nCorporate\nSecretary.\n\nNotice by the Surviving Entity\n\nIf the mergers are completed, the surviving\nentity, within ten (10) days after the\neffective time, will notify each holder of\nDiscover\npreferred stock who has properly made a\nwritten demand for appraisal pursuant to\nSection 262 of the DGCL, and any beneficial\nowner who has demanded appraisal in such\nperson\u0092s name pursuant to Section 262 of the\nDGCL, that the mergers\nhave become effective and the effective date\nthereof.\n\nFiling a Petition of Appeal\n\nWithin 120 days after the effective date, the\nsurviving entity or any record holder or\nbeneficial owner of shares of Discover\npreferred stock\nwho has demanded appraisal of such person\u0092s\nshares and is entitled to appraisal rights may\nfile a petition with the Delaware Court of\nChancery, with a copy served on the surviving\nentity in the case of a petition filed by a\nstockholder or\nbeneficial owner, demanding a determination of\nthe value of the Discover preferred stock held\nby all such persons entitled to appraisal. The\nsurviving entity is under no obligation to and\nhas no present intention to file a petition\nand stockholders\nand beneficial owners should not assume that\nthe surviving entity will file a petition or\ninitiate any negotiations with respect to the\nfair value of Discover preferred stock.\nAccordingly, it is the obligation of the\nstockholders and beneficial\nowners of shares of Discover preferred stock\nto initiate all necessary action to perfect\ntheir appraisal rights within the time\nprescribed\n\n100\n\nin Section 262 of the DGCL. If no such\npetition is filed by a record holder or\nbeneficial owner of shares of Discover\npreferred stock, or by the surviving entity,\nwithin the 120-day period specified in Section\n262 of the DGCL, holders of Discover preferred\nstock and beneficial owners\u0092 rights to an\nappraisal will cease. If a petition for\nappraisal is duly filed by a holder of\nDiscover preferred stock or beneficial owner\nand a copy of the petition is served on the\nsurviving entity, the surviving entity will\nthen be obligated, within twenty (20) days\nafter such service, to file in the office of\nthe Register in\nChancery in which the petition was filed a\nduly verified list (which we refer to as the\n\u0093verified list\u0094) containing the names and\naddresses of all holders of Discover preferred\nstock and beneficial owners who have demanded\npayment for\ntheir shares of Discover preferred stock and\nwith whom agreements as to the value of their\nshares of Discover preferred stock have not\nbeen reached by the surviving entity. Upon the\nfiling of any such petition, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may\norder that notice of the time and place fixed\nfor the hearing on the petition be mailed to\nthe surviving entity and all persons shown on\nthe verified list at the addresses stated\ntherein. The costs of these notices are borne\nby the surviving entity.\nAfter notice to the surviving entity and\nholders of Discover preferred stock and\nbeneficial owners as required by the court of\nDiscover preferred stock, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing\nupon the petition, and to\ndetermine those holders of Discover preferred\nstock and beneficial owners who have complied\nwith Section 262 of the DGCL and who have\nbecome entitled to the appraisal rights\nprovided thereby.\n\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may require the\nholders of Discover preferred stock and\nbeneficial owners who have demanded appraisal\nfor their\nshares of Discover preferred stock to submit\ntheir stock certificates (if any) to the\nRegister in Chancery for notation thereon of\nthe pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and\nif any holder of Discover preferred stock or\nbeneficial owner fails to\ncomply with that direction, the Delaware Court\nof Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to\nthat stockholder or beneficial owner.\n\nDetermination of \u0093Fair Value\u0094\n\nAfter the Delaware Court of Chancery\ndetermines the holders of Discover preferred\nstock and beneficial owners entitled to\nappraisal, the\nappraisal proceeding will be conducted in\naccordance with the rules of the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery, including any rules\nspecifically governing appraisal proceedings.\nThrough this proceeding, the Delaware Court of\nChancery will determine the\n\u0093fair value\u0094 of the shares, exclusive of any\nelement of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the mergers,\ntogether with interest, to be paid, if any,\nupon the amount determined to be \u0093fair value\u0094\nin an\nappraisal proceeding. Unless the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery in its discretion determines\notherwise for good cause shown, interest from\nthe effective date through the date of payment\nof the judgment will be compounded quarterly\nand will accrue at 5%\nover the Federal Reserve discount rate\n(including any surcharge) as established from\ntime to time during the period between the\neffective date and the date of payment of the\njudgment. However, at any time before the\nDelaware Court of Chancery\u0092s\nentry of judgment in the proceedings, the\nsurviving entity may pay to each holder of\nDiscover preferred stock and beneficial owner\nentitled to appraisal an amount in cash, which\nis referred to as a voluntary cash payment, in\nwhich case interest will\naccrue thereafter only upon the sum of (i) the\ndifference, if any, between the amount so paid\nby the surviving entity and the fair value of\nthe shares as determined by the Delaware Court\nof Chancery and (ii) interest theretofore\naccrued,\nunless paid at that time.\n\nHolders of Discover preferred stock and\nbeneficial owners who consider seeking\nappraisal should be aware that\nthe fair value of their shares under Section\n262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same\nas, or less than the value of the\nconsideration provided for in the merger\nagreement without the exercise of appraisal\nrights. No representation is made\nas to the outcome of the appraisal of fair\nvalue as determined by the Delaware Court of\nChancery.\n\nUpon application by the surviving\nentity or by any person entitled to\nparticipate in the appraisal proceeding, the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may, in its\ndiscretion, proceed to trial upon the\nappraisal prior to the final determination of\nthe persons entitled to an appraisal. Any\nperson whose name appears on the verified list\nmay participate fully in all proceedings until\nit is finally determined that such person is\nnot entitled to appraisal rights. When the\nfair value of the shares is determined, the\nDelaware Court of\nChancery will direct the payment of such\n\n101\n\nvalue, with interest thereon, if any, to the\npersons entitled thereto and upon such terms\nand conditions as the Delaware Court of\nChancery may order. The Delaware Court of\nChancery\u0092s decree\nmay be enforced as other decrees in the\nDelaware Court of Chancery may be enforced.\nThe Delaware Court of Chancery may determine\nthe cost of the appraisal proceeding (which do\nnot include attorneys\u0092 fees or the fees and\nexpenses of experts) and\nassess it against the parties as the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery deems equitable. Upon\napplication of a person whose name appears on\na verified list and who participated in the\nproceeding and incurred expenses in connection\ntherewith, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery may order that all or a\nportion of such expenses, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorneys\u0092 fees and the\nfees and expenses of experts, be charged pro\nrata against the value of all shares of\nDiscover preferred stock\nentitled to appraisal. In the absence of a\ncourt determination or assessment, each party\nwill bear its own expenses.\n\nAny holder of\nDiscover preferred stock or beneficial owner\nwho has demanded appraisal in compliance with\nSection 262 of the DGCL will not, after the\neffective time, be entitled to vote such stock\nfor any purpose or receive payment of\ndividends or other\ndistributions, if any, on the Discover\npreferred stock, except for dividends or\ndistributions, if any, payable to person at a\ndate before the effective time.\n\nRequest for Appraisal Data\n\nIf a record holder of Discover preferred stock\nor beneficial owner submits a written demand\nfor appraisal of such record holder\u0092s or\nbeneficial owner\u0092s shares of Discover\npreferred stock and otherwise properly\nperfects such record holder\u0092s or beneficial\nowner\u0092s appraisal rights, such record holder\nor beneficial owner may, upon written request\nmailed to the\nsurviving entity within 120 days after the\neffective time, receive a statement\nidentifying (1) the aggregate number of shares\nof Discover preferred stock with respect to\nwhich Discover has received written demands\nfor appraisal; and\n(2) the aggregate number of holders of\nDiscover preferred stock or beneficial owners\nholding or owning such shares (provided that,\nin the case of a demand made by a beneficial\nowner in such person\u0092s name, the record holder\nof such shares\nwill not be considered a separate stockholder\nholding such shares for purposes of such\naggregate number). This statement will be\ngiven to such record holder or beneficial\nowner within ten (10) days after receiving\nsuch record holder\u0092s or\nbeneficial owner\u0092s written request, or within\nten (10) days after the expiration of the\nperiod for delivery of demands for appraisal,\nwhichever is later.\n\nWithdrawal\n\nAt any time\nwithin sixty (60) days after the effective\ntime, any person entitled to appraisal rights\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding\nor joined that proceeding as a named party may\nwithdraw such person\u0092s demand for appraisal in\nrespect of\nsome or all of such person\u0092s shares and accept\nthe consideration offered pursuant to the\nmerger agreement with respect to the shares\nsubject to the withdrawal by delivering to the\nsurviving entity a written withdrawal of the\ndemand for\nappraisal. Once a petition for appraisal is\nfiled with the Delaware Court of Chancery,\nhowever, no appraisal proceeding may be\ndismissed as to any person without the\napproval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and\nsuch approval may be conditioned\nupon such terms as the Delaware Court of\nChancery deems just; provided that this\nsentence does not affect the right of any\nperson who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party to withdraw such person\u0092s\ndemand in respect of some or all of such\nperson\u0092s shares and to accept the terms\noffered under the merger agreement with\nrespect to the shares subject to the\nwithdrawal within sixty (60) days after the\neffective time.

This statement will be given to such\nrecord holder or beneficial owner within ten\n(10) days after receiving such record holder\u0092s\nor beneficial owner\u0092s written request, or\nwithin ten\n(10) days after the expiration of the period\nfor delivery of demands for appraisal,\nwhichever is later.\n\nWithdrawal\n\nAt any time within sixty (60) days after the\neffective time, any person entitled to\nappraisal rights who has not commenced an\nappraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party may withdraw such person\u0092s demand\nfor appraisal in respect of some or all of\nsuch person\u0092s shares and accept the\nconsideration offered pursuant to the merger\nagreement with respect to\nthe shares subject to the withdrawal by\ndelivering to the surviving entity a written\nwithdrawal of the demand for appraisal. Once a\npetition for appraisal is filed with the\nDelaware Court of Chancery, however, no\nappraisal proceeding may be\ndismissed as to any person without the\napproval of the Delaware Court of Chancery and\nsuch approval may be conditioned upon such\nterms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems\njust; provided that this sentence does not\naffect the right of any person\nwho has not commenced an appraisal proceeding\nor joined that proceeding as a named party to\nwithdraw such person\u0092s demand in respect of\nsome or all of such person\u0092s shares and to\naccept the terms offered under the merger\nagreement with\nrespect to the shares subject to the\nwithdrawal within sixty (60) days after the\neffective time.

The description\nin this section and elsewhere in this joint\nproxy statement/prospectus is subject to, and\nqualified in its entirety by reference to, the\ncomplete text of the merger agreement, which\nis attached asAnnexAto this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus and incorporated by\nreference herein. This summary does not\npurport to be complete and may not contain all\nof the information about the merger agreement\nthat is important to you. We urge you to read\nthe full text of the merger agreement, as it\nis the legal document governing the mergers.\nThis section is not intended to provide you\nwith any factual information about Capital One\nor Discover. Such information can be found\nelsewhere in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus and in the public filings\nCapital One and Discover make with the SEC, as\ndescribed in the section entitled \u0093Where You\nCan Find More Information\u0094 beginning on page\n189.\n\nExplanatory Note Regarding the Merger\nAgreement\n\nThe merger agreement and this summary of terms\nare included to provide you with information\nregarding the terms of the merger agreement.\nFactual disclosures about Capital One and\nDiscover contained in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus or in the public reports\nof Capital One or Discover filed with the SEC\nmay supplement, update or modify the factual\ndisclosures about Capital One\nand Discover contained in the merger\nagreement. The merger agreement contains\nrepresentations and warranties by Capital One,\non the one hand, and by Discover, on the other\nhand, made solely for the benefit of the\nother. The representations,\nwarranties and covenants made in the merger\nagreement by Capital One and Discover were\nqualified and subject to important limitations\nagreed to by Capital One and Discover in\nconnection with negotiating the terms of the\nmerger agreement. In\nparticular, in your review of the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in\nthe merger agreement and described in this\nsummary, it is important to bear in mind that\nthe representations and warranties were\nnegotiated with the principal purpose of\nestablishing circumstances in which a party to\nthe merger agreement may have the right not to\nconsummate the mergers if the representations\nand warranties of the other party prove to be\nuntrue due to a change in circumstance or\notherwise, and\nallocating risk between the parties to the\nmerger agreement, rather than establishing\nmatters as facts. The representations and\nwarranties also may be subject to a\ncontractual standard of materiality that is\ndifferent from that generally applicable\nto stockholders and reports and documents\nfiled with the SEC, and some were qualified by\nthe matters contained in the confidential\ndisclosure schedules that Capital One and\nDiscover each delivered in connection with the\nmerger agreement and in\ncertain documents filed with the SEC.\nMoreover, information concerning the subject\nmatter of the representations and warranties,\nwhich do not purport to be accurate as of the\ndate of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,\nmay have changed since the\ndate of the merger agreement. Accordingly, the\nrepresentations and warranties in the merger\nagreement should not be relied on by any\npersons as characterizations of the actual\nstate of facts about Capital One and Discover\nat the time they were made\nor otherwise and should be read only in\nconjunction with the other information\nprovided elsewhere in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus or incorporated by\nreference into this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. See the section entitled\n\u0093Where You Can Find More Information\u0094\nbeginning on page 189.\n\nStructure of the Mergers\n\nEach of Capital One\u0092s and Discover\u0092s\nrespective boards of directors has unanimously\napproved the merger agreement. The\nmerger agreement provides that, pursuant to\nthe terms and subject to the conditions set\nforth in the merger agreement, Merger Sub will\nmerge with and into Discover, with Discover as\nthe surviving corporation, which is referred\nto as the first\nmerger. Immediately following the first\nmerger, Discover will merge with and into\nCapital One, with Capital One as the surviving\ncorporation, which is referred to as the\nsecond step merger. Immediately following the\ncompletion of the second step\nmerger, Discover Bank will merge with and into\nCapital One Bank, with Capital One Bank as the\nsurviving bank, which is referred to as the\nbank merger.\n\n104\n\nAt any time prior to the closing Discover and\nCapital One may, upon their mutual agreement,\nchange the method or structure of effecting\nthe transactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, if and to the extent they both deem\nsuch change to be necessary, appropriate or\ndesirable. However, no such change may (i)\nalter or change the\nexchange ratio or the number of shares of\nCapital One common stock received by Discover\nstockholders in exchange for each share of\nDiscover common stock or the treatment of\nDiscover preferred stock, (ii) adversely\naffect the tax treatment of\nDiscover stockholders or Capital One stock\npursuant to the merger agreement, (iii)\nadversely affect the tax treatment of Discover\nor Capital One pursuant to the merger\nagreement, or (iv) materially impede or delay\nthe consummation of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement in a timely manner.\n\nMerger Consideration\n\nEach share of Discover common stock issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective\ntime, except for shares of Discover common\nstock\nowned by Discover or Capital One (in each\ncase, other than shares of Discover common\nstock (i) held in trust accounts, managed\naccounts, mutual funds and the like, or\notherwise held in a fiduciary or agency\ncapacity that are beneficially owned\nby third parties, or (ii) held, directly or\nindirectly, by Discover or Capital One in\nrespect of debts previously contracted), will\nbe converted into the right to receive 1.0192\nshares of Capital One common stock.\n\nAll of the shares of Discover common stock\nconverted into the right to receive the merger\nconsideration will no longer be outstanding\nand will\nautomatically be cancelled and will cease to\nexist as of the effective time, and each\ncertificate (each, an \u0093old certificate,\u0094 which\nalso refers to book-entry account statements\nrelating to the\nownership of shares of Discover common stock)\npreviously representing any such shares of\nDiscover common stock will thereafter\nrepresent only the right to receive (i) a new\ncertificate representing the number of whole\nshares of Capital One\ncommon stock which such shares of Discover\ncommon stock have been converted into the\nright to receive pursuant to the merger\nagreement, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional\nshares which the shares of Discover common\nstock represented by such old\ncertificate have been converted into the right\nto receive pursuant to the merger agreement,\nwithout any interest thereon, and (iii) any\ndividends or distributions which the holder\nthereof has the right to receive pursuant to\nthe merger\nagreement, without any interest thereon.\n\nIf, prior to the effective time, the\noutstanding shares of Capital One common stock\nor Discover\ncommon stock have been increased, decreased,\nchanged into or exchanged for a different\nnumber or kind of shares or securities as a\nresult of a reorganization, recapitalization,\nreclassification, stock dividend, stock split\nor reverse stock split, or\nthere has been any extraordinary dividend or\ndistribution, an appropriate and proportionate\nadjustment will be made to the exchange ratio\nto give Capital One and the Discover\nstockholders the same economic effect as\ncontemplated by the merger\nagreement prior to such event.\n\nAt the effective time, all shares of Discover\ncommon stock that are owned by Capital One or\nDiscover (in\neach case other than shares of Discover common\nstock (i) held in trust accounts, managed\naccounts, mutual funds and the like, or\notherwise held in a fiduciary or agency\ncapacity that are beneficially owned by third\nparties or (ii) held,\ndirectly or indirectly, by Discover or Capital\nOne in respect of debts previously contracted)\nwill be cancelled and will cease to exist and\nno Capital One common stock or other\nconsideration will be delivered in exchange\ntherefor.\n\nIn the second step merger, each share of\nDiscover series C preferred stock and Discover\nseries D preferred stock, in each case issued\nand\noutstanding immediately prior to the second\neffective time, will be converted into the\nright to receive one (1) share of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock or Capital One series\nP preferred stock, respectively. The new\nCapital One preferred\nstock will have terms that are not materially\nless favorable than the terms of the\napplicable series of Discover preferred stock.\n\n105\n\nTreatment of Fractional Shares\n\nCapital One will not issue any fractional\nshares of Capital One common stock in the\nmergers. Instead, a former Discover\nstockholder who\notherwise would have received a fraction of a\nshare of Capital One common stock will receive\nan amount in cash rounded to the nearest whole\ncent. This cash amount will be determined by\nmultiplying the fraction of a share (after\ntaking into account\nall shares of Discover common stock held by\nsuch holder immediately prior to the effective\ntime and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth\nwhen expressed in decimal form) of Capital One\ncommon stock to which\nthe holder would otherwise be entitled by the\naverage closing-sale price per share of\nCapital One common stock for the consecutive\nperiod of five (5) trading days ending on the\nday preceding the closing date.\n\nTreatment of Discover Equity Awards and the\nDiscover ESPP\n\nDiscover RSU Awards\n\nAt the effective\ntime, each Discover RSU award (except for\ncertain Discover RSU awards discussed in the\nsection entitled \u0093The Mergers\u0097Interests of\nDiscover\u0092s Directors and Executive Officers in\nthe Mergers\u0097Treatment of Discover Equity\nAwards\u0094 beginning on page 88) that is\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective\ntime will, automatically and without any\nrequired action on the part of the holder\nthereof, be converted into a Capital One RSU\naward, with the number of shares of Capital\nOne common stock (rounded to the nearest whole\nshare) equal to the product of (i) the total\nnumber of shares of Discover common stock\nsubject to the Discover RSU award immediately\nprior to the\neffective time multiplied by (ii) the exchange\nratio. Each converted Capital One RSU award\nwill be settled in shares of Capital One\ncommon stock and will otherwise continue to be\nsubject to the same terms and conditions\n(including\nvesting terms and terms governing acceleration\nof vesting upon qualifying terminations) as\napplied to the corresponding Discover RSU\naward immediately prior to the effective time.\n\nDiscover PSU Awards\n\nAt the effective\ntime, each Discover PSU award that is\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective\ntime will, automatically and without any\nrequired action on the part of the holder\nthereof, be converted into a Capital One cash-\nbased award in respect of an amount\nin cash equal to the product of (i) the total\nnumber of shares of Discover common stock\nsubject to the Discover PSU award underlying\nsuch award, with the total number of shares of\nDiscover common stock determined based on the\ngreater of target\nand actual performance through the last\nquarter ending simultaneously with or prior to\nthe effective time for the Discover PSU awards\nfor which as of the effective time more than\none year of the performance period has\nelapsed, with such performance\nlevel to be determined consistent with past\npractice by the compensation committee of the\nDiscover board of directors based on\ninformation available through the last quarter\nending simultaneously with or prior to the\neffective time, and target\nperformance for Discover PSU awards for which\none year or less of the performance period has\nelapsed, multiplied by (ii) the product of (1)\nthe exchange ratio and (2) the average of the\nclosing sale prices of Capital One common\nstock on the New York Stock Exchange for the\nconsecutive period of five (5) full trading\ndays ending on the day preceding the closing\ndate. Each converted Capital One cash-based\naward will be settleable in cash and otherwise\ncontinue to be\nsubject to the same terms and conditions\n(including service-based vesting terms and\nterms governing acceleration of vesting upon\nqualifying terminations) as applied to the\ncorresponding Discover PSU award immediately\nprior to the effective time.\n\nDiscover ESPP\n\nPrior to the\neffective time, Discover, the Discover board\nof directors and the Discover compensation\ncommittee, as applicable, will take action\nwith respect to the Discover ESPP to provide\nthat the final exercise date (including for\npurposes of determining the\npurchase price) for the purchase period that\notherwise would be in effect on the closing\ndate will be no later than five business days\nprior to the effective time. Discover will\n\n106\n\nterminate the Discover ESPP as of no later\nthan immediately prior to the effective time,\npursuant to resolutions adopted by the\nDiscover board of directors or the Discover\ncompensation committee,\nas applicable.\n\nClosing and Effective Time\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the\nmerger agreement, the closing will take place\nby electronic exchange of documents at 10:00\na.m. New\nYork City time, on a date which will be no\nlater than three (3) business days after the\nsatisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable\nlaw) of all of the conditions precedent set\nforth in the merger agreement (other than\nthose conditions that by\ntheir nature can only be satisfied at the\nclosing, but subject to the satisfaction or\nwaiver thereof), unless another date, time or\nplace is agreed to in writing by Discover and\nCapital One.\n\nThe mergers will become effective as set forth\nin the applicable certificate of merger (each,\na \u0093certificate of merger\u0094) to be filed\nwith the Secretary of State of the State of\nDelaware.\n\nExchange of Shares\n\nLetter of Transmittal\n\nAs promptly\nas practicable after the effective time, but\nin no event later than five (5) days\nthereafter, Capital One will cause the\nexchange agent to mail to each holder of\nrecord of one or more old certificates\nrepresenting shares of Discover common\nstock or Discover preferred stock immediately\nprior to the effective time that have been\nconverted at the effective time or the second\neffective time, as applicable, into the right\nto receive Capital One common stock or new\nCapital One preferred\nstock, as applicable, pursuant to the merger\nagreement, a letter of transmittal (which will\nspecify that delivery will be effected, and\nrisk of loss and title to the old certificates\nwill pass, only upon proper delivery of the\nold certificates to\nthe exchange agent) and instructions for use\nin effecting the surrender of the old\ncertificates in exchange for new certificates\nrepresenting the number of whole shares of\nCapital One common stock and any cash in lieu\nof fractional shares or shares\nof new Capital One preferred stock, as\napplicable, which the shares of Discover\ncommon stock or Discover preferred stock\nrepresented by such old certificate or old\ncertificates will have been converted into the\nright to receive pursuant to the\nmerger agreement as well as any dividends or\ndistributions to be paid pursuant to the\nmerger agreement. Upon proper surrender of an\nold certificate or old certificates for\nexchange and cancellation to the exchange\nagent, together with such properly\ncompleted and duly executed letter of\ntransmittal, the holder of such old\ncertificate or old certificates will be\nentitled to receive in exchange therefor, as\napplicable, (1) in the case of a Discover\nstockholder, (A) a new certificate\nrepresenting that number of whole shares of\nCapital One common stock to which such\nDiscover stockholder is entitled pursuant to\nthe merger agreement and (B) a check\nrepresenting the amount of (x) any cash in\nlieu of fractional shares which\nsuch stockholder has the right to receive in\nrespect of the old certificate or old\ncertificates surrendered pursuant to the\nmerger agreement and (y) any dividends or\ndistributions which the holder thereof has the\nright to receive pursuant to\nthe merger agreement, or (2) in the case of a\nholder of Discover preferred stock, (A) a new\ncertificate representing that number of shares\nof new Capital One preferred stock to which\nsuch holder of Discover preferred stock is\nentitled\npursuant to the merger agreement and (B) a\ncheck representing the amount of any dividends\nor distributions which the holder thereof has\nthe right to receive pursuant to the merger\nagreement. Thereafter, the old certificate or\nold certificates\nso surrendered will be cancelled. No interest\nwill be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of\nfractional shares or dividends or\ndistributions payable to holders of old\ncertificates. Until surrendered as\ncontemplated by the merger agreement, each old\ncertificate will be deemed at any time after\nthe effective time or the second effective\ntime, as applicable, to represent only the\nright to receive, upon surrender, the number\nof whole shares of Capital One common stock or\nshares of new Capital One\npreferred stock which the shares of Discover\ncommon stock or Discover preferred stock, as\napplicable, represented by such old\ncertificate have been converted into the right\nto receive and any cash in lieu of fractional\nshares or in respect of\ndividends or distributions as contemplated by\nthe merger agreement.\n\n107\n\nAfter the effective time or the second\neffective time, as applicable, there will be\nno transfers on the stock transfer books of\nDiscover of the shares of Discover common\nstock or Discover preferred stock that were\nissued and outstanding immediately prior\nthereto. If, after the effective time or the\nsecond effective time, as applicable, old\ncertificates representing such shares are\npresented for transfer to the exchange agent,\nthey will be cancelled and exchanged for new\ncertificates representing shares of Capital\nOne common stock or new Capital One preferred\nstock, as applicable, as provided in the\nmerger agreement. None of Capital One,\nDiscover, the surviving entity, the exchange\nagent or any other person will be liable to\nany former holder of shares of Discover common\nstock or Discover preferred stock for any\namount delivered in good faith to a public\nofficial pursuant to applicable abandoned\nproperty, escheat or similar laws. Withholding\nCapital One will be entitled to deduct and\nwithhold, or cause the exchange agent to\ndeduct and withhold, from any cash in lieu of\nfractional shares of Capital One common stock,\ncash dividends or distributions payable\npursuant to the merger agreement or any other\namounts otherwise payable pursuant to the\nmerger agreement to any Discover stockholder,\nor any holder of Discover preferred stock or\nDiscover equity awards, such amounts as it is\nrequired to deduct and withhold with respect\nto the making of such payment under the Code\nor any provision of state, local or foreign\ntax law. To the extent that amounts are so\nwithheld by Capital One or the exchange agent,\nas the case may be, and paid over to the\nappropriate governmental authority, the\nwithheld amounts will be treated for all\npurposes of the merger agreement as having\nbeen paid to the Discover stockholder, or any\nholder of Discover preferred stock or Discover\nequity awards in respect of which the\ndeduction and withholding was made by Capital\nOne or the exchange agent, as the case may be.\nDividends and Distributions No dividends or\nother distributions declared with respect to\nCapital One common stock or new Capital One\npreferred stock will be paid to the holder of\nany unsurrendered old certificate until the\nholder thereof has surrendered such old\ncertificate in accordance with the merger\nagreement. After the surrender of an old\ncertificate in accordance with the merger\nagreement, the record holder thereof will be\nentitled to receive any such dividends or\nother distributions, without any interest\nthereon, which had become payable with respect\nto the whole shares of Capital One common\nstock or shares of new Capital One preferred\nstock that the shares of Discover common stock\nor Discover preferred stock, as applicable,\nrepresented by such old certificate have been\nconverted into the right to receive.\nRepresentations and Warranties The merger\nagreement contains representations and\nwarranties made by each of Capital One and\nDiscover relating to a number of matters,\nincluding the following:\n                                              \n      corporate matters, including due        \n      organization, qualification and         \n      subsidiaries;

In exercising the foregoing right,\neach of Capital One and Discover has agreed to\nact reasonably and as promptly as practicable.\nEach of Capital One and Discover has agreed to\nconsult with each other with respect to the\nobtaining of all permits, consents, approvals\nand authorizations of all third parties and\ngovernmental entities necessary or advisable\nto consummate the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement and each such party will\nkeep the other apprised of the status of\nmatters relating to completion of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement.

Each\nof Capital One and Discover has agreed to use\nits reasonable best efforts to respond to any\nrequest for information and resolve any\nobjection that may be asserted by any\ngovernmental entity with respect to the merger\nagreement or the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, nothing contained in the merger\nagreement will be deemed to require Capital\nOne or Discover or any of their respective\nsubsidiaries, and neither Capital One nor\nDiscover nor any of their respective\nsubsidiaries will be permitted (without the\nwritten consent of the other party), to take\nany action, or commit to take any action, or\nagree to any condition or restriction, in\nconnection with obtaining the foregoing\npermits, consents, approvals and\nauthorizations of governmental entities that\nwould reasonably be expected to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the surviving\nentity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,\nafter giving effect to the mergers, also\nreferred to as a \u0093materially burdensome\nregulatory condition.\u0094 114\n\nCapital One and Discover have agreed to, upon\nrequest, furnish each other with all\ninformation concerning themselves, their\nsubsidiaries, directors, officers and\nstockholders and such other matters as may be\nreasonably necessary or advisable in\nconnection with this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus or any other statement,\nfiling,\nnotice or application made by or on behalf of\nCapital One, Discover or any of their\nrespective subsidiaries to any governmental\nentity in connection with the mergers, the\nbank merger and the other transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement.\n\nCapital One and Discover have agreed to\npromptly advise each other upon receiving any\nmaterial substantive communication from any\ngovernmental entity relating to any requisite\nregulatory approval or other approval or\nclearance of any governmental entity being\nsought in connection with the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement and/or\nthe bank merger agreement.\n\nEmployee Matters\n\nCapital One\nwill, and will cause each of its subsidiaries\nto, for the one (1)-year period following the\neffective time, maintain for each employee of\nDiscover and any of its subsidiaries as of the\neffective time who remains so employed\nimmediately following the\neffective time (the \u0093continuing employees\u0094),\nfor so long as they are employed by the\nsurviving entity following the effective time\n(i) base salary or wages (as applicable) that\nis no less favorable than that provided to the\ncontinuing\nemployee as of immediately prior to the\neffective time, (ii) target annual cash\nincentive compensation and target long-term\nincentive compensation opportunities that are\nno less favorable in the aggregate to the\naggregate target annual cash\nincentive compensation and target long-term\nincentive compensation opportunities provided\nto the continuing employee as of immediately\nprior to the effective time, (iii) employee\nbenefits (other than severance) that are\nsubstantially comparable\nin the aggregate to the employee benefits\n(other than severance) provided by Discover to\nthe continuing employees as of immediately\nprior to the effective time, and (iv)\nseverance benefits no less favorable than the\nseverance benefits provided\nto the continuing employees under the plans\nlisted in the confidential disclosure\nschedules.\n\nWith respect to any Capital One benefit\nplans in which any continuing employees become\neligible to participate on or after the\neffective time, Capital One will, and will\ncause each of its subsidiaries to (i) waive\nall pre-existing conditions,\nexclusions and waiting periods with respect to\nparticipation and coverage requirements\napplicable to such employees and their\neligible dependents under any such Capital One\nbenefit plans that provide health care\nbenefits, except to the extent such pre-\nexisting conditions, exclusions or waiting\nperiods would apply under the analogous\nDiscover benefit plan, (ii) use commercially\nreasonable efforts to provide each such\nemployee and their eligible dependents\nwith credit for any co-payments or coinsurance\nand deductibles paid prior to the effective\ntime under a Capital One benefit plan that\nprovides health care benefits, to the same\nextent that such credit was\ngiven under the analogous Discover benefit\nplan prior to the effective time, in\nsatisfying any applicable deductible, co-\npayment, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket\nrequirements under any such Capital One\nbenefit plan, and (iii) use commercially\nreasonable efforts to recognize all service of\nsuch employees with Discover and its\nsubsidiaries for\npurposes of eligibility to participate,\nvesting and levels of benefits in any such\nCapital One benefit plan to the same extent\nthat such service was taken into account under\nthe analogous Discover benefit plan prior to\nthe effective time. However,\nthe foregoing service recognition will not\napply (A) to the extent it would result in a\nduplication of benefits for the same period of\nservice, (B) for purposes of any pension plan\nor (C) for purposes of any benefit plan that\nis a\nfrozen plan or provides grandfathered\nbenefits.\n\nDirector and Officer Indemnification and\nInsurance\n\nThe merger agreement provides that from and\nafter the effective time, the surviving entity\nwill indemnify and hold harmless and will\nadvance\nexpenses as incurred, in each case to the\nextent (subject to applicable law) such\npersons are indemnified as of the date of the\nmerger agreement by Discover pursuant to the\nDiscover charter, the Discover bylaws, the\ngoverning or organizational\ndocuments of any subsidiary of Discover and\nany indemnification agreements in existence as\nof the date of the merger agreement and\ndisclosed to Capital One in the confidential\ndisclosure schedules to the merger agreement,\neach present and former\ndirector, officer or\n\n115\n\nemployee of Discover and its subsidiaries (the\n\u0093Discover indemnified parties\u0094) against any\ncosts or expenses (including reasonable\nattorneys\u0092 fees), judgments, fines, losses,\ndamages or liabilities incurred in connection\nwith any threatened or actual claim, action,\nsuit, proceeding or investigation, whether\ncivil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative, whether arising before or after\nthe effective time, arising out\nof or pertaining to the fact that such person\nis or was a director, officer or employee of\nDiscover or any of its subsidiaries and\npertaining to matters or facts existing or\noccurring at or prior to the effective time,\nincluding the transactions\ncontemplated by the merger agreement (provided\nthat in the case of advancement of expenses,\nany Discover indemnified party to whom\nexpenses are advanced provides an undertaking\nto repay such advances if it is ultimately\ndetermined that such Discover\nindemnified party is not entitled to\nindemnification).\n\nThe merger agreement provides that for a\nperiod of six (6) years after the\neffective time, the surviving entity will\ncause to be maintained in effect the current\npolicies of directors\u0092 and officers\u0092 liability\ninsurance maintained by Discover (provided\nthat the surviving entity may substitute\ntherefor policies\nwith a substantially comparable insurer of at\nleast the same coverage and amounts containing\nterms and conditions that are no less\nadvantageous to the insured) with respect to\nclaims against the present and former officers\nand directors of Discover\nand any of its subsidiaries arising from facts\nor events which occurred at or before the\neffective time. However, the surviving entity\nwill not be obligated to expend, on an annual\nbasis, an amount in excess of 300% of the\ncurrent annual premium\npaid as of the date of the merger agreement by\nDiscover for such insurance (the \u0093premium\ncap\u0094), and if such premiums for such insurance\nwould at any time exceed the premium cap, then\nthe surviving entity will cause to be\nmaintained\npolicies of insurance which, in the surviving\nentity\u0092s good faith determination, provide the\nmaximum coverage available at an annual\npremium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of\nthe foregoing, Capital One or Discover, in\nconsultation with, but\nonly upon the consent of Capital One, may (and\nat the request of Capital One, Discover will\nuse its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at\nor prior to the effective time a six (6)-year\n\u0093tail\u0094 policy under Discover\u0092s existing\ndirectors\nand officers insurance policy providing\nequivalent coverage to that described in the\npreceding sentence if and to the extent that\nthe same may be obtained for an amount that,\nin the aggregate, does not exceed the premium\ncap.\n\nThe above obligations relating to\nindemnification and directors\u0092 and officers\u0092\ninsurance will survive the effective time and\nare\nintended to be for the benefit of, and will be\nenforceable by, each Discover indemnified\nparty and his or her heirs and\nrepresentatives, each of whom will be express\nthird-party beneficiaries of the indemnity and\ninsurance provisions of the merger\nagreement. If the surviving entity or any of\nits successors or assigns (i) consolidates\nwith or merges into any other person and is\nnot the continuing or surviving entity of such\nconsolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all\nor\nsubstantially all of its assets or deposits to\nany other person or engages in any similar\ntransaction, then in each such case, the\nsurviving entity will cause proper provision\nto be made so that the successors and assigns\nof the surviving entity\nwill expressly assume the above obligations\nrelating to indemnification and directors\u0092 and\nofficers\u0092 insurance. The obligations of the\nsurviving entity or any of its successors\nunder the indemnity and insurance provisions\nof the merger\nagreement may not be terminated or modified\nafter the effective time in a manner so as to\nadversely affect any Discover indemnified\nparty or any other person entitled to the\nbenefits of such provisions without the prior\nwritten consent of the\naffected Discover indemnified party or\naffected person.\n\nRestructuring Efforts\n\nThe merger agreement provides that if either\nDiscover or Capital One fails to obtain the\nrequisite Discover vote or the requisite\nCapital One\nvote at the duly convened Discover special\nmeeting or Capital One special meeting, as\napplicable, or any adjournment or postponement\nthereof, each of the parties will in good\nfaith use its reasonable best efforts to\nnegotiate a restructuring of the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement (provided that neither party will\nhave any obligation to alter or change any\nmaterial terms, including the exchange ratio,\nthe treatment of the Discover preferred stock\nor the amount or kind of the\nconsideration to be issued to holders of the\ncapital stock of Discover as provided for in\nthe merger agreement or any term that would\nadversely affect the tax treatment of the\ntransactions contemplated thereby in a manner\nadverse to such party or\nits stockholders) and/or resubmit the merger\nagreement and the transactions contemplated by\nthe merger agreement (or as restructured\npursuant to the merger agreement) to its\nrespective stockholders for adoption or\napproval.\n\n116\n\nGovernance of Capital One after the Mergers\n\nAt the effective time, the board of directors\nof Capital One will be increased by three (3)\ndirectors for a total of fifteen\n(15) directors, and three (3) current\ndirectors of Discover, as determined by mutual\nagreement of Discover and Capital One, will be\nappointed to the Capital One board of\ndirectors.\n\nStockholder Meetings and Recommendations of\nCapital One\u0092s and Discover\u0092s Boards of\nDirectors\n\nEach of Discover and Capital One have agreed\nto call a meeting of their respective\nstockholders to be held as soon as reasonably\npracticable\nafter the registration statement of which this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part\nis declared effective, for the purpose of\nobtaining (a) the requisite Discover vote and\nthe requisite Capital One vote and (b) if so\ndesired and\nmutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of\nthe type customarily brought before a meeting\nof stockholders in connection with the\napproval of a merger agreement or the\ntransactions contemplated by the merger\nagreement, and each of Discover and\nCapital One has agreed to use its reasonable\nbest efforts to cause such meetings to occur\nas soon as reasonably practicable and on the\nsame date. Each of Capital One and Discover\nand their respective boards of directors will\nuse its reasonable best\nefforts to obtain from the stockholders of\nCapital One and Discover, as applicable, the\nrequisite Capital One vote and the requisite\nDiscover vote, as applicable, including by\ncommunicating to the respective stockholders\nof Capital One and Discover\nits respective recommendation that, in the\ncase of Capital One, the stockholders of\nCapital One approve the Capital One share\nissuance proposal, and in the case of\nDiscover, the stockholders of Discover adopt\nthe merger agreement (the \u0093Capital\nOne board recommendation\u0094 and the \u0093Discover\nboard recommendation,\u0094 respectively). Each of\nCapital One and Discover and their respective\nboards of directors will not (i) withhold,\nwithdraw, modify or qualify in a manner\nadverse to\nthe other party the Capital One board\nrecommendation, in the case of Capital One, or\nthe Discover board recommendation, in the case\nof Discover, (ii) fail to make such board\nrecommendation in this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus,\n(iii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an\nacquisition proposal (as defined below) or\npublicly announce an intention to adopt,\napprove, recommend or endorse an acquisition\nproposal (as defined below), (iv) fail to\npublicly and without\nqualification (A) recommend against any\nacquisition proposal or (B) reaffirm the\nCapital One board recommendation, in the case\nof Capital One, or the Discover board\nrecommendation, in the case of Discover, in\neach case within ten\n(10) business days (or such fewer number of\ndays as remains prior to the Capital One\nspecial meeting or the Discover special\nmeeting, as applicable) after an acquisition\nproposal is made public or any request by the\nother party to do so, or\n(v) publicly propose to do any of the\nforegoing (any of the foregoing, a\n\u0093recommendation change\u0094). However, subject to\nthe merger agreement termination and\ntermination fee provisions, if the Capital One\nboard of directors or the\nDiscover board of directors, after receiving\nthe advice of its outside counsel and, with\nrespect to financial matters, its financial\nadvisors, determines in good faith that it\nwould more likely than not result in a\nviolation of its fiduciary duties\nunder applicable law to make or continue to\nmake the Capital One board recommendation or\nthe Discover board recommendation, as\napplicable, such board of directors may, in\nthe case of Capital One, prior to the receipt\nof the requisite Capital One\nvote, and in the case of Discover, prior to\nthe receipt of the requisite Discover vote,\nsubmit the merger agreement to its\nstockholders without recommendation (although\nthe resolutions approving the merger agreement\nas of the date of the merger\nagreement may not be rescinded or amended), in\nwhich event such board of directors may\ncommunicate the basis for its lack of a\nrecommendation to its stockholders in an\nappropriate amendment or supplement to this\njoint proxy statement/prospectus, to\nthe extent required by law. However, such\nboard of directors may not take any such\nactions unless it (1) gives the other party at\nleast three (3) business days\u0092 prior written\nnotice of its intention to take such action\nand a\nreasonable description of the event or\ncircumstances giving rise to its determination\nto take such action (including, in the event\nsuch action is taken in response to an\nacquisition proposal, the latest material\nterms and conditions of, and the\nidentity of the third party making, any such\nacquisition proposal, or any amendment or\nmodification thereof, or describe in\nreasonable detail such other event or\ncircumstances) and (2) at the end of such\nnotice period, takes into account any\namendment or modification to the merger\nagreement proposed by the other party and,\nafter receiving the advice of its outside\ncounsel and, with respect to financial\nmatters, its financial advisors, determines in\ngood faith that it would nevertheless\nmore likely than not result in a violation of\nits fiduciary duties under applicable law to\nmake or continue to make the Capital One board\nrecommendation or\n\n117\n\nthe Discover board recommendation, as the case\nmay be. Any material amendment to any\nacquisition proposal will be deemed to be a\nnew acquisition proposal for purposes of the\nmerger agreement and\nwill require a new notice period as referred\nto in the merger agreement.\n\nEach of Capital One or Discover has agreed to\nadjourn or\npostpone the Capital One special meeting or\nthe Discover special meeting, as the case may\nbe, if, as of the time for which such meeting\nis originally scheduled there are insufficient\nshares of Capital One common stock or Discover\ncommon stock, as\nthe case may be, represented (either in person\nor by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary\nto conduct the business of such meeting, or if\non the date of such meeting Discover or\nCapital One, as applicable, has not received\nproxies representing a\nsufficient number of shares necessary to\nobtain the requisite Discover vote or the\nrequisite Capital One vote. However, the date\nof the Capital One special meeting or the\nDiscover special meeting, as applicable, may\nnot be postponed or adjourned\nmore than twice and in each case for more than\nan aggregate of fifteen (15) days in\nconnection with any one postponement or\nadjournment or more than an aggregate of\nthirty (30) days from the original date of the\napplicable meeting\n(excluding any adjournments or postponements\nrequired by applicable law). Unless the merger\nagreement has been terminated in accordance\nwith its terms, (x) the Capital One special\nmeeting must be convened and the Capital One\nshare issuance\nproposal must be submitted to the stockholders\nof Capital One at the Capital One special\nmeeting and (y) the Discover special meeting\nmust be convened and the merger agreement must\nbe submitted to the stockholders of Discover\nat the Discover\nspecial meeting.\n\nAgreement Not to Solicit Other Offers\n\nEach of Capital One and Discover has agreed\nthat it will not, will cause each of its\nsubsidiaries not to and will cause its and\ntheir\nrespective officers, directors and employees\nnot to, and will use its reasonable best\nefforts to cause its agents, advisors and\nrepresentatives (collectively,\n\u0093representatives\u0094) not to, directly or\nindirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,\nknowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate\nany inquiries or proposals with respect to any\nacquisition proposal, (ii) engage or\nparticipate in any negotiations with any\nperson concerning any acquisition proposal,\n(iii) provide any\nconfidential or nonpublic information or data\nto, or have or participate in any discussions\nwith, any person relating to any acquisition\nproposal or (iv) unless the merger agreement\nhas been terminated in accordance with its\nterms, approve or\nenter into any term sheet, letter of intent,\ncommitment, memorandum of understanding,\nagreement in principle, acquisition agreement,\nmerger agreement or other agreement (whether\nwritten or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other\nthan a confidentiality\nagreement referred to and entered into in\naccordance with the merger agreement) in\nconnection with or relating to any acquisition\nproposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in\nthe event that after the date of the merger\nagreement and prior to the\nreceipt of the requisite Discover vote, in the\ncase of Discover, or the requisite Capital One\nvote, in the case of Capital One, a party\nreceives an unsolicited bona fide written\nacquisition proposal, such party may, and may\npermit its subsidiaries\nand its and its subsidiaries\u0092 representatives\nto, furnish or cause to be furnished\nconfidential or nonpublic information or data\nand participate in such negotiations or\ndiscussions with the person making the\nacquisition proposal if the board of\ndirectors of such party concludes in good\nfaith (after receiving the advice of its\noutside counsel, and with respect to financial\nmatters, its financial advisors) that failure\nto take such actions would be more likely than\nnot to result in a\nviolation of its fiduciary duties under\napplicable law. Prior to furnishing any such\nconfidential or nonpublic information, such\nparty must have entered into a confidentiality\nagreement with the person making such\nacquisition proposal on terms no\nless favorable to it than the confidentiality\nagreement between Capital One and Discover,\nwhich confidentiality agreement may not\nprovide such person with any exclusive right\nto negotiate with such party. Capital One and\nDiscover agreed to, and\nagreed to cause its representatives to,\nimmediately cease and cause to be terminated\nany activities, discussions or negotiations\nconducted before the date of the merger\nagreement with any person other than Discover\nor Capital One, as applicable,\nwith respect to any acquisition proposal. Each\nparty has agreed to promptly (within twenty-\nfour (24) hours) advise the other party\nfollowing receipt of any acquisition proposal\nor any inquiry which could reasonably be\nexpected to lead to an\nacquisition proposal, and the substance\nthereof (including the terms and conditions of\nand the identity of the person making such\ninquiry or acquisition proposal), provide the\nother party with an unredacted copy of any\nsuch acquisition proposal and\nany draft agreements, proposals or other\nmaterials\n\n118\n\nreceived in connection with any such inquiry\nor acquisition proposal, and keep the other\nparty apprised of any related developments,\ndiscussions and negotiations on a current\nbasis, including any amendments to or\nrevisions of the terms of such inquiry or\nacquisition proposal.

Amendment, Waiver\nand Extension of the Merger Agreement Subject\nto compliance with applicable law, the merger\nagreement may be amended by the parties at any\ntime before or after the receipt of the\nrequisite Capital One vote or the requisite\nDiscover vote, except that after receipt of\nthe requisite Capital One vote or the\nrequisite Discover vote, there may not be,\nwithout further approval of the stockholders\nof Capital One or Discover, as applicable, any\namendment of the merger agreement that\nrequires such further approval under\napplicable law.

Any agreement\non the part of either of the parties to any\nsuch extension or waiver will be valid only if\nset forth in a written instrument signed on\nbehalf of such party, but such extension or\nwaiver or failure to insist on strict 122\n\ncompliance with an obligation, covenant,\nagreement or condition will not operate as a\nwaiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any\nsubsequent or other failure.\n\nGoverning Law\n\nThe merger agreement is\ngoverned by and will be construed in\naccordance with the laws of the State of\nDelaware, without regard to any applicable\nconflicts of law principles.\n\nSpecific Performance\n\nCapital One and\nDiscover will be entitled to specific\nperformance of the terms of the merger\nagreement, including an injunction or\ninjunctions to prevent breaches or threatened\nbreaches of the merger agreement or to enforce\nspecifically the performance of the terms\nand provisions of the merger agreement\n(including the parties\u0092 obligation to\nconsummate the merger), in addition to any\nother remedy to which they are entitled at law\nor in equity. Each of Capital One and Discover\nwaives any defense in any\naction for specific performance that a remedy\nat law would be adequate and any requirement\nunder any law to post security or a bond as a\nprerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.\n\n123\n\nMATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES\nOF THE MERGERS The following discussion sets\nforth the anticipated material U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences of the mergers to U.S.\nholders (as defined below) of Discover common\nstock and Discover preferred stock. This\ndiscussion does not address any tax\nconsequences arising under the laws of any\nstate, local or foreign jurisdiction, or under\nany U.S. federal laws other than those\npertaining to income tax. This discussion is\nbased upon the Code, the regulations\npromulgated under the Code and court and\nadministrative rulings and decisions, all as\nin effect on the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus. These laws may change,\npossibly retroactively, and any change could\naffect the accuracy of the statements and\nconclusions set forth in this discussion. This\ndiscussion addresses only those Discover\nstockholders and holders of Discover preferred\nstock that hold their shares of Discover\ncommon stock or Discover preferred stock, as\napplicable, as a capital asset within the\nmeaning of Section 1221 of the Code\n(generally, property held for investment).\nFurther, this discussion does not address all\naspects of U.S. federal income taxation that\nmay be relevant to you in light of your\nparticular circumstances or that may be\napplicable to you if you are subject to\nspecial treatment under the U.S. federal\nincome tax laws, including if you are:\n                                \n      a financial institution;  \n                                \n                                  \n      a tax-exempt organization;  \n                                  \n                                              \n      a pass-through entity (or an investor   \n      in a pass-through entity);              \n                                              \n                             \n      an insurance company;  \n                             \n                      \n      a mutual fund;  \n                      \n                                              \n      a dealer or broker in stocks and        \n      securities, or currencies;              \n                                              \n                                          \n      a trader in securities that elects  \n      mark-to-market treatment;           \n                                          \n                                              \n      a Discover stockholder or holder of     \n      Discover preferred stock that received  \n      Discover common stock or Discover       \n      preferred stock, as applicable,         \n      through the exercise of an employee     \n      stock option, through a tax qualified   \n      retirement plan or otherwise as         \n      compensation;                           \n                                              \n                                           \n      a person that is not a U.S. holder;  \n                                           \n                                              \n      a person that has a functional          \n      currency other than the U.S. dollar;    \n                                              \n                                       \n      a real estate investment trust;  \n                                       \n                                       \n      regulated investment companies;  \n                                       \n                                              \n      a Discover stockholder or holder of     \n      Discover preferred stock that holds     \n      Discover common stock or Discover       \n      preferred stock, as applicable, as      \n      part of a hedge, straddle,              \n      constructive sale, wash sale,           \n      conversion or other integrated          \n      transaction; or                         \n                                              \n                          \n      a U.S. expatriate.  \n                          \nIn addition, the discussion does not address\nany alternative minimum tax or any state,\nlocal or foreign tax consequences of the\nmergers, nor does it address any tax\nconsequences arising under the unearned income\nMedicare contribution tax pursuant to the\nHealth Care and Education Reconciliation Act\nof 2010. Determining the actual tax\nconsequences of the mergers to you may be\ncomplex. They will depend on your specific\nsituation and on factors that are not within\nthe control of Discover or Capital One. You\nshould consult with your own tax advisor as to\nthe tax consequences of the mergers in your\nparticular circumstances. For purposes of this\ndiscussion, the term \u0093U.S. holder\u0094 means a\nbeneficial owner of Discover common stock or\nDiscover preferred stock that is for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes (i) an individual\ncitizen or resident of the 124\n\nUnited States, (ii) a corporation, or entity\ntreated as a corporation, organized in or\nunder the laws of the United States or any\nstate thereof or the District of Columbia,\n(iii) a trust if a court within the United\nStates is able to exercise primary supervision\nover the administration of the trust and one\nor more U.S. persons have the authority to\ncontrol all substantial decisions of the\ntrust, or (iv) an estate, the income of which\nis includible in gross income for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes regardless of its source.\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a\npartner in an entity or arrangement that is\ntreated as a partnership for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes and that holds Discover\ncommon stock or Discover preferred stock\ngenerally will depend on the status of the\npartner and the activities of the partnership.\nPartners in a partnership holding Discover\ncommon stock or Discover preferred stock\nshould consult their own tax advisors. Tax\nConsequences of the Mergers Generally The\nparties intend for the mergers, taken\ntogether, to qualify as a \u0093reorganization\u0094\nwithin the meaning of Section 368(a) of the\nCode. It is a condition to Capital One\u0092s\nobligation to complete the first merger that\nCapital One receive an opinion from Wachtell,\nLipton, Rosen & Katz, dated the closing date,\nto the effect that the mergers, taken\ntogether, will qualify as a \u0093reorganization\u0094\nwithin the meaning of Section 368(a) of the\nCode. It is a condition to Discover\u0092s\nobligation to complete the first merger that\nDiscover receive an opinion from Sullivan &\nCromwell LLP, dated as of the closing date, to\nthe effect that the mergers, taken together,\nwill qualify as a \u0093reorganization\u0094 within the\nmeaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These\nopinions will be based on the assumption that\nthe first merger and the second step merger\nwill be completed in the manner set forth in\nthe merger agreement and the registration\nstatement on Form S-4of which this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus forms a part, and on\nrepresentation letters provided by Capital One\nand Discover to be delivered at the time of\nthe closing. These opinions will also be based\non the assumption that the representations\nfound in the representation letters are, as of\nthe effective time, true and complete without\nqualification and that the representation\nletters are executed by appropriate and\nauthorized officers of Capital One and\nDiscover. If any of the representations,\nwarranties, covenants or assumptions upon\nwhich the opinions described above are based\nare inconsistent with the actual facts, or if\nany condition contained in the merger\nagreement and affecting these opinions is\nbreached or is waived by any party, the U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences of the mergers\ncould be adversely affected. Neither of the\nopinions described above will be binding on\nthe IRS. Capital One and Discover have not\nsought and will not seek any ruling from the\nIRS regarding any matters relating to the\nmergers, and, as a result, there can be no\nassurance that the IRS will not assert, or\nthat a court would not sustain, a position\ncontrary to any of the conclusions set forth\nbelow. As a \u0093reorganization,\u0094 the material\nU.S. federal income tax consequences of the\nmergers to U.S. holders of Discover common\nstock or Discover preferred stock are set\nforth in the remainder of this discussion:\n                                              \n      a holder who receives solely shares of  \n      Capital One common stock (or receives   \n      Capital One common stock and cash       \n      solely in lieu of a fractional share)   \n      in exchange for shares of Discover      \n      common stock or a holder who receives   \n      solely shares of new Capital One        \n      preferred stock in exchange for shares  \n      of Discover preferred stock generally   \n      will not recognize any gain             \n      or loss upon the first merger or the    \n      second step merger, as applicable,      \n      except with respect to the cash         \n      received by a Discover stockholder in   \n      lieu of a fractional share of Capital   \n      One common stock;                       \n                                              \n                                              \n      the aggregate tax basis of the Capital  \n      One common stock or new Capital One     \n      preferred stock, as applicable,         \n      received in the first merger or the     \n      second step merger, as applicable,      \n      (including fractional share interests   \n      in Capital One common stock deemed      \n      received and exchanged for cash) will   \n      be equal to the holder\u0092s aggregate tax   \n      basis in the Discover                   \n      common stock or Discover preferred      \n      stock, as applicable, for which it is   \n      exchanged; and                          \n                                              \n125\n                                              \n      the holding period of Capital One       \n      common stock or new Capital One         \n      preferred stock, as applicable,         \n      received in the                         \n      first merger or the second step         \n      merger, as applicable, (including any   \n      fractional shares deemed received and   \n      redeemed as described below) will       \n      include the holder\u0092s holding period of   \n      the Discover common stock or Discover   \n      preferred stock, as                     \n      applicable, for which it is exchanged.  \n                                              \nIf holders acquired different blocks of\nDiscover common stock or Discover preferred\nstock at different times and at different\nprices, a holder\u0092s tax basis and holding\nperiod in Capital One common stock or new\nCapital One preferred stock may be determined\nwith reference to each block of Discover\ncommon stock or Discover preferred stock, as\napplicable. Cash Instead of a Fractional Share\nA Discover stockholder who receives cash\ninstead of a fractional share of Capital One\ncommon stock will be treated as having\nreceived the fractional share of Capital One\ncommon stock pursuant to the first merger and\nthen as having sold that fractional share for\ncash. As a result, generally such a holder\nwill recognize gain or loss equal to the\ndifference between the amount of cash received\nand the basis allocable to such holder\u0092s\nfractional share of Capital One common stock.\nThis gain or loss generally will be capital\ngain or loss, and will be long-term capital\ngain or loss if, as of the effective time, the\nholding period for the shares (including the\nholding period of Discover common stock\nsurrendered therefor) is greater than one (1)\nyear. The deductibility of capital losses is\nsubject to limitations. Backup Withholding\nPayments of cash to a non-corporateDiscover\nstockholder in connection with the first\nmerger may be subject to information reporting\nand backup withholding (currently at a rate of\n24%). A Discover stockholder generally will\nnot be subject to backup withholding, however,\nif the holder:\n                                              \n      furnishes a correct taxpayer            \n      identification number, certifies that   \n      the holder is not subject to backup     \n      withholding on IRS form W-9 (or an      \n      applicable substitute or successor      \n      form) and otherwise complies with all   \n      the applicable requirements of the      \n      backup withholding rules; or            \n                                              \n                                              \n      provides proof of an applicable         \n      exemption from backup withholding.      \n                                              \nAny amounts withheld under the backup\nwithholding rules are not additional tax and\nwill generally be allowed as a refund or\ncredit against the holder\u0092s U.S. federal\nincome tax liability, provided the required\ninformation is timely furnished to the\nInternal Revenue Service. This summary of\ncertain material U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences is for general information only\nand is not tax advice. You are urged to\nconsult your tax advisor with respect to the\napplication of U.S. federal income tax laws to\nyour particular situation as well as any tax\nconsequences arising under the U.S. federal\nestate or gift tax rules, or under the laws of\nany state, local, foreign or other taxing\njurisdiction. 126\n\nUNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION Introduction The\nfollowing unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information and notes\nthereto have been prepared in accordance with\nArticle 11 of Regulation S-Xin order to give\neffect to the mergers and the related\ntransaction accounting adjustments (pro forma\nadjustments) described in the accompanying\nnotes. The merger agreement was entered into\non February 19, 2024, and provides that each\nshare of Discover common stock issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the effective\ntime (other than certain shares owned by\nDiscover or Capital One, subject to certain\nexceptions set forth in the merger agreement)\nwill be converted into the right to receive\n1.0192 shares of Capital One common stock. In\naddition, each share of Discover preferred\nstock issued and outstanding immediately prior\nto the effective time of the second step\nmerger will be converted into the right to\nreceive one (1) share of an applicable newly\nissued series of new Capital One preferred\nstock having terms that are not materially\nless favorable than the terms of the\napplicable series of Discover preferred stock.\nEach outstanding Discover depositary share\nrepresenting a 1/100th interest in a share of\nDiscover preferred stock will become a new\nCapital One depositary share and will\nrepresent a 1/100th interest in a share of the\napplicable series of new Capital One preferred\nstock. The unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined statement of income for the year\nended December 31, 2023 combines the\nhistorical results of Capital One and\nDiscover, giving effect to the mergers\n(including the issuance of shares of Capital\nOne common stock and new Capital One preferred\nstock in the mergers) as if those transactions\nhad occurred on January 1, 2023, the first day\nof Capital One\u0092s fiscal year. The unaudited\npro forma condensed combined balance sheet as\nof December 31, 2023 combines the historical\nconsolidated balance sheets of Capital One and\nDiscover as of December 31, 2023, giving\neffect to the mergers (including the issuance\nof shares of Capital One common stock and new\nCapital One preferred stock in the mergers) as\nif those transactions had occurred on December\n31, 2023. The unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information contained\nherein does not give effect to any of the\nfinancial results of Capital One or Discover\nfollowing December 31, 2023, including the\nfirst quarter 2024 financial results of\nDiscover described under \u0093 Summary\u0097 Recent\nDevelopments.\u0094 The historical consolidated\nfinancial statements of Capital One and\nDiscover has been adjusted in the accompanying\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information to give effect to pro\nforma events that are necessary to account for\nthe mergers (including the issuance of shares\nof Capital One common stock and new Capital\nOne preferred stock in the mergers), in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. The unaudited pro\nforma adjustments are based upon available\ninformation and certain assumptions that\nCapital One believes are reasonable. The\nfollowing unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information does not\nreflect the costs of any integration\nactivities or benefits that may result from\nthe realization of future cost savings from\noperating efficiencies, impacts of Discover\u0092s\ncontemplation of its disposition of its\nprivate student loan portfolio, or any other\nbusiness changes or synergies that may result\nfrom the mergers. Based on known facts and\ncircumstances and because the mergers are not\ncontingent on the disposition of Discover\u0092s\nprivate student loan portfolio, the unaudited\npro forma condensed combined financial\ninformation does not reflect any transaction\naccounting adjustments related to a potential\nsale of Discover\u0092s private student loan\nportfolio and presents that portfolio\nconsistent with Discover\u0092s historical audited\nconsolidated financial statements as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Certain reclassifications\nhave also been made to conform the historical\nfinancial statement presentation of Discover\nto that of Capital One. The following\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information should be read in\nconjunction with:\n                                              \n      the accompanying notes to the           \n      unaudited pro forma condensed combined  \n      financial information;                  \n                                              \n127\n                                              \n      the separate historical audited         \n      consolidated financial statements of    \n      Capital One as of and for the fiscal    \n      year                                    \n      ended December\u00a031, 2023, and the        \n      related notes, included in Capital      \n      One\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for     \n      the fiscal year ended December\u00a031,      \n      2023; and                               \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n      the separate historical audited         \n      consolidated financial statements of    \n      Discover as of and for the fiscal year  \n      ended                                   \n      December\u00a031, 2023, and the related      \n      notes, included in Discover\u0092s Annual     \n      Report on Form\u00a010-K for the fiscal      \n      year ended December\u00a031, 2023.           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \nAccounting for the Mergers The mergers are\nbeing accounted for as a business combination\nusing the acquisition method with Capital One\nas the accounting acquirer in accordance with\nAccounting Standards Codification (\u0093ASC\u0094)\nTopic 805, Business Combinations. Under this\nmethod of accounting, the aggregate purchase\nconsideration will be allocated to Discover\u0092s\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed based\nupon their estimated fair values at the date\nof completion of the mergers. The process of\nvaluing the net assets of Discover immediately\nprior to the mergers, as well as evaluating\naccounting policies for conformity, is\npreliminary. Any differences between the\nestimated fair value of the purchase\nconsideration and the estimated fair value of\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nwill be recorded as goodwill. Accordingly, the\npurchase price allocation and related\nadjustments reflected in this unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial information\nare preliminary and subject to revision until\na final determination of fair value of the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed is\nperformed.

The unaudited pro forma\ncondensed combined financial information\npresented is for informational purposes only\nand is not necessarily indicative of the\nfinancial position or results of operations\nthat would have been realized if the mergers\n(including the issuance of shares of Capital\nOne common stock and new Capital One preferred\nstock in the mergers) had been completed on\nthe dates set forth above, nor is it\nindicative of the future results or financial\nposition of Capital One following the mergers.\nThe pro forma adjustments are preliminary and\nare subject to change as additional\ninformation becomes available and as\nadditional analysis is performed. To the\nextent information was publicly available,\nsuch preliminary fair value estimates were\ncorroborated against readily available\ninformation, inclusive of fair value marks\ndisclosed on comparable portfolios of\nfinancial assets and liabilities.

THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED\nCOMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nNote 1 \u0096 Basis of Presentation\n\nThe\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information and related notes are\nprepared in accordance with Article 11 of\nRegulation S-X.\n\nAs discussed in Note 2, certain\nreclassifications were made to align Discover\nwith Capital One\u0092s financial statement\npresentation.\nCapital One is currently in the process of\nevaluating Discover\u0092s accounting policies with\nthe information currently available and has\ndetermined that no significant adjustments are\nnecessary to conform Discover\u0092s financial\nstatements to\nthe accounting policies used by Capital One.\nTherefore, the only changes noted herein are\nthose related to presentation. As a result of\nthis ongoing review and as more information\nbecomes available, additional differences\ncould be identified between\nthe accounting policies of the two companies\nuntil finalized upon completion of the\nmergers.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information was prepared using the\nacquisition method of accounting in accordance\nwith ASC 805, with Capital One as the\naccounting acquirer, using the fair value\nconcepts defined in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value\nMeasurement, and based on the\nhistorical financial statements of Capital One\nand Discover. Under ASC 805, all assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed in a business\ncombination are recognized and measured at\ntheir fair values as of the acquisition date,\nwhile transaction costs\nassociated with the business combination are\nexpensed as incurred. The excess of purchase\nconsideration over the estimated fair value of\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed, if\nany, is allocated to goodwill.\n\nThe allocation of the aggregate purchase\nconsideration depends upon certain estimates\nand assumptions, all of which are preliminary.\nAs of the\ndate of this registration statement, Capital\nOne has not completed the valuation analysis\nand calculations in sufficient detail\nnecessary to arrive at the required estimates\nof the fair market value of Discover\u0092s assets\nto be acquired or\nliabilities to be assumed, other than a\npreliminary estimate for intangible assets and\ncertain financial assets and financial\nliabilities. Accordingly, apart from the\naforementioned, certain Discover assets and\nliabilities are presented at their\nrespective carrying amounts and should\ntherefore be treated as preliminary. A final\ndetermination of the fair value of Discover\u0092s\nassets and liabilities will be based on\nDiscover\u0092s actual assets and liabilities as of\nthe closing date of\nthe mergers and, therefore, cannot be made\nprior to the consummation of the mergers. The\nallocation of the aggregate purchase\nconsideration has been made for the purpose of\ndeveloping the unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information.\nThe final determination of fair values of\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed\nrelating to the mergers could differ\nmaterially from the preliminary allocation of\naggregate purchase consideration. The final\nvaluation will be based on the actual\nnet tangible and intangible assets of Discover\nexisting at the acquisition date.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nbalance\nsheet, as of December 31, 2023, and the\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined\nstatement of income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, presented herein, are based\non the historical financial statements of\nCapital One and Discover. The\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined balance\nsheet as of December 31, 2023, is presented as\nif Capital One\u0092s acquisition of Discover had\noccurred on December 31, 2023 and combines the\nhistorical balance sheet of Capital One as of\nDecember 31, 2023 with the historical balance\nsheet of Discover as of December 31, 2023. The\nunaudited pro forma condensed combined\nstatement of income for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 has been prepared as if the\nmergers had\noccurred on January 1, 2023 and combines\nCapital One\u0092s historical statement of income\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\nwith Discover\u0092s historical statement of income\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial information does not reflect any\nanticipated synergies or dis-synergies,\noperating efficiencies or cost savings that\nmay result from the mergers or any acquisition\nand integration costs that may be incurred.\nThe pro forma adjustments represent\nmanagement\u0092s best\nestimates and are based upon currently\navailable information and certain assumptions\nthat Capital One believes\n\n131\n\nare reasonable under the circumstances. There\nare no material transactions between Capital\nOne and Discover during the period presented.\nAccordingly, adjustments to eliminate\ntransactions between Capital One and Discover\nhave not been reflected in the unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial\ninformation. Note 2 \u0096 Conforming Accounting\nPolicies and Reclassification Adjustments\nDuring the preparation of this unaudited pro\nforma condensed combined financial\ninformation, Capital One performed a\npreliminary analysis of Discover\u0092s financial\ninformation to identify differences in\naccounting policies as compared to those of\nCapital One and differences in financial\nstatement presentation as compared to the\npresentation of Capital One. With the\ninformation currently available, Capital One\nis not aware of any differences in accounting\npolicies that would have a material impact on\nthe unaudited pro forma condensed combined\nfinancial statements. However, certain\nreclassification adjustments have been made to\nconform Discover\u0092s historical financial\nstatement presentation to Capital One\u0092s\nhistorical financial statement presentation.\nFollowing the completion of the mergers, or as\nmore information becomes available, Capital\nOne will finalize the review of accounting\npolicies and reclassifications, which could be\nmaterially different from the amounts set\nforth in the unaudited pro forma condensed\ncombined financial information presented\nherein.\n                                              \n      The following items represent certain   \n      reclassification adjustments to         \n      conform Discover\u0092s Historical            \n      Consolidated Balance Sheet              \n  A.

The estimate is subject   \n        to change as further information is   \n        obtained and a detailed analysis can  \n        be conducted. Capital One performed   \n        a sensitivity analysis of the         \n        potential                             \n        difference between carrying value     \n        and fair value and determined it to   \n        be not significant for the purpose    \n        of these unaudited pro forma          \n        condensed combined financial          \n        information.                          \n                                              \n                                              \n       In connection with the mergers,        \n       Capital One has agreed to convert      \n       certain equity awards held by          \n       Discover                               \n       employees into Capital One equity      \n       awards. Additionally, as described in  \n       the section entitled \u0093Quantification    \n       of Payments and Benefits to Discover\u0092s  \n       Named Executive Officers\u0094 beginning on  \n       page 91, certain                       \n       executives are entitled to             \n  iv.  incremental compensation upon a        \n       change in control. Based on the        \n       preliminary analysis and public        \n       information available, Capital One     \n       believes the impact of the             \n       replacement stock compensation awards  \n       and change in control                  \n       payments are immaterial to the         \n       purchase consideration and therefore   \n       no adjustment is reflected. However,   \n       this estimate is subject to change as  \n       further information is obtained and a  \n       detailed analysis can be conducted.    \n                                              \nThe value of the purchase consideration to be\npaid by Capital One in shares of Capital One\ncommon stock and new Capital One preferred\nstock upon the consummation of the mergers\nwill be determined based on the closing price\nof Capital One common stock and new Capital\nOne preferred stock on the closing date and\nthe number of issued and outstanding shares of\nDiscover common stock and Discover preferred\nstock immediately prior to the closing.

As the\npreliminary estimated fair values could\nsignificantly differ from the amounts\npresented a sensitivity analysis was performed\nto assess the impact of a hypothetical change\nof 10%. A 10% change in the valuation of\nintangible assets would cause a corresponding\nincrease or decrease in the intangible assets\nby approximately $1,058 million. The amount of\nintangibles following the mergers may differ\nsignificantly based upon the final assigned\nfair value of each identifiable intangible\nasset.

The effective tax rate of\nCapital One following the mergers could be\nsignificantly different (either higher or\nlower) depending on post-merger activities,\nincluding cash needs, the geographical mix of\nincome and changes in tax law. Because the tax\nrates used for the pro forma financial\ninformation are estimated, the pro forma tax\nrate will likely vary from the actual\neffective rate in periods subsequent to\ncompletion of the mergers. This determination\nis preliminary and subject to change based\nupon the final determination of the fair value\nof the acquired assets and assumed\nliabilities. 141\n\n(i) Represents the adjustment to earnings per\nshare for the year ended December 31, 2023 to\npresent pro forma basic and diluted weighted\naverage shares of Capital One following the\nmergers using the historical weighted average\nshares of Capital One common stock outstanding\ncombined with the additional Capital One\ncommon stock issued in conjunction with the\nmergers. Due to the net loss for the year\nended December 31, 2023, there are no common\nshares added to calculate dilutive earnings\nper share because the effect would be anti-\ndilutive.

(the\n\u0093calculation agent\u0094) on the applicable series\nM reset dividend determination date as\nfollows: (i) the treasury rate will be the\naverage of the yields on actively traded U.S.\ntreasury securities\nadjusted to constant maturity, for five-year\nmaturities, appearing under \u0093Treasury Constant\nMaturities,\u0094 for the five (5) business days\nimmediately preceding the series M reset\ndividend determination date for that series M\nreset\nperiod, available on or by reference to the\nmost recently published statistical release\ndesignated H.15 Daily Update or any successor\npublication which is published by the Federal\nReserve Board as of 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time)\nas of such series M\nreset dividend determination date, as\ndetermined by the calculation agent in its\nsole discretion, or (ii) if no calculation is\nprovided as described above, then the\ncalculation agent will use a substitute or\nsuccessor rate that Capital One or\nits designee have determined, in their sole\ndiscretion, after consulting any source that\nCapital One or its designee deem to be\nreasonable, is the industry-accepted\nsubstitute or successor for the treasury rate\nor if there is no such\nindustry-accepted substitute or successor for\nthe treasury rate, a substitute or successor\nrate that is most comparable to the treasury\nrate. Upon selection of a substitute or\nsuccessor rate, the calculation agent may\napply any technical,\nadministrative or operational change that\nCapital One or its designee may determine\nafter consulting any source Capital One or its\ndesignee deem to be reasonable, including with\nrespect to the day count convention, the\nbusiness day convention, the\ndefinition of business day, the series M reset\ndividend determination date and any other\nrelevant methodology or definition for\ncalculating such substitute or successor rate,\nincluding any adjustment factor that Capital\nOne or its designee determine\nis needed to make such substitute or successor\nrate comparable to the treasury rate, in a\nmanner that is consistent with any industry-\naccepted practices for such substitute or\nsuccessor rate. If the calculation agent,\nCapital One or its designee are\nunable to\n\n145\n\ndetermine a substitute or successor base rate\nin accordance with the foregoing, then the\ntreasury rate will be the same interest rate\ndetermined for the prior series M reset\ndividend\ndetermination date or, if applicable with\nrespect to the first series M reset dividend\ndetermination date, 0.793%.\n\nAbsent manifest error,\nany determination by the calculation agent,\nCapital One or its designee of the dividend\nrate for a series M dividend period shall be\nbinding and conclusive. The determination or\ncalculation by the calculation agent, Capital\nOne or its designee of\nany dividend rate, dividends for any series M\ndividend period and any technical,\nadministrative or operational changes that the\ncalculation agent, Capital One, or its\ndesignee determine for calculating any\nsubstitute or successor base rate, shall be\nmaintained on file at Capital One\u0092s principal\noffices and shall be made available to any\nholder of Capital One Series M preferred stock\nupon request.\n\nDividends are payable to holders of record of\nCapital One preferred stock as they appear on\nthe stock register on the applicable record\ndate,\nwhich will be the fifteenth (15) calendar day\nbefore the applicable dividend payment date,\nor such other record date, not exceeding\nthirty (30) days before the applicable payment\ndate, as\nwill be fixed by the Capital One board of\ndirectors or a duly authorized committee\nthereof. The corresponding record dates for\nthe Capital One depositary shares are the same\nas the record dates for the applicable series\nof Capital One preferred\nstock.\n\nA dividend period is the period from and\nincluding a dividend payment date to but\nexcluding the next dividend payment date.\nDividends payable on each series of Capital\nOne preferred stock will be computed on the\nbasis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve\n30-day months. Dollar amounts\nresulting from that calculation are rounded to\nthe nearest cent, with one-half cent being\nrounded upward. Dividends on a series of\nCapital One preferred stock will cease to\naccrue on the redemption date, if\nany, as described below in the section\nentitled \u0093\u0097Redemption,\u0094 unless Capital One\ndefaults in the payment of the redemption\nprice of the shares of the Capital One\npreferred stock called for redemption.\n\nCapital One\u0092s ability to pay dividends on the\nCapital One preferred stock depends on the\nability of its subsidiaries, including Capital\nOne Bank, to pay dividends to Capital One. The\nability of Capital One and Capital One Bank to\npay dividends in the future is subject to bank\nregulatory requirements and capital guidelines\nand policies established by the Federal\nReserve Board and the\nOCC.\n\nSo long as any share of Capital One preferred\nstock of a series remains outstanding, (1) no\ndividend will be declared or paid\nor set aside for payment and no distribution\nwill be declared or made or set aside for\npayment on any junior stock (other than (i) a\ndividend payable solely in junior stock, or\n(ii) any dividend in connection with the\nimplementation of a\nstockholders\u0092 rights plan, or the redemption\nor repurchase of any rights under any such\nplan), (2) no shares of junior stock will be\nrepurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired\nfor consideration by us, directly or\nindirectly (other than\n(i) as a result of a reclassification of\njunior stock for or into other junior stock,\n(ii) the exchange or conversion of one share\nof junior stock for or into another share of\njunior stock, (iii) through the use of the\nproceeds of a\nsubstantially contemporaneous sale of other\nshares of junior stock, (iv) purchases,\nredemptions or other acquisitions of shares of\nthe junior stock in connection with any\nemployment contract, benefit plan or other\nsimilar arrangement with or\nfor the benefit of employees, officers,\ndirectors or consultants, (v) purchases of\nshares of junior stock pursuant to a\ncontractually binding requirement to buy\njunior stock existing prior to the preceding\ndividend period, including under a\ncontractually binding stock repurchase plan,\n(vi) the purchase of fractional interests in\nshares of junior stock pursuant to the\nconversion or exchange provisions of such\nstock or the security being converted or\nexchanged, (vii) purchases\nor other acquisitions by any of Capital One\u0092s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries solely for the\npurpose of market making, stabilization or\ncustomer facilitation transactions in junior\nstock in the ordinary course of business,\n(viii) purchases by\nany of Capital One\u0092s broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries of Capital One capital stock for\nresale pursuant to an offering by Capital One\nof such capital stock underwritten by such\nbroker-dealer subsidiary, or (ix) the\nacquisition by Capital One or\nany of its subsidiaries of record ownership in\njunior stock for the beneficial ownership of\nany other persons (other than for the\nbeneficial ownership by Capital One or any of\nits subsidiaries), including as trustees or\n\n146\n\ncustodians, nor will any monies be paid to or\nmade available for a sinking fund for the\nredemption of any such securities by Capital\nOne), and (3) no shares of parity stock, if\nany, will be\nrepurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired\nfor consideration by Capital One, directly or\nindirectly, during a dividend period (other\nthan (i) pursuant to pro rata offers to\npurchase all, or a pro rata portion, of the\nCapital One preferred\nstock of such series and such parity stock, if\nany, (ii) as a result of a reclassification of\nparity stock for or into other parity stock,\n(iii) the exchange or conversion of parity\nstock for or into other parity stock or junior\nstock,\n(iv) through the use of the proceeds of a\nsubstantially contemporaneous sale of other\nshares of parity stock, (v) purchases of\nshares of parity stock pursuant to a\ncontractually binding requirement to buy\nparity stock existing prior to the\npreceding dividend period, including under a\ncontractually binding stock repurchase plan,\n(vi) the purchase of fractional interests in\nshares of parity stock pursuant to the\nconversion or exchange provisions of such\nstock or the security being\nconverted or exchanged, (vii) purchases or\nother acquisitions by any of Capital One\u0092s\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries solely for the\npurpose of market making, stabilization or\ncustomer facilitation transactions in parity\nstock in the ordinary\ncourse of business, (viii) purchases by any of\nCapital One\u0092s broker-dealer subsidiaries of\nCapital One capital stock for

custodians, nor will any monies\nbe paid to or made available for a sinking\nfund for the redemption of any such securities\nby Capital One) unless, in each case, the full\ndividends for the preceding dividend period on\nall outstanding\nshares of Capital One preferred stock of such\nseries have been paid in full or declared and\na sum sufficient for the payment thereof has\nbeen set aside for payment.\n\nCapital One will not declare or pay or set\napart funds for the payment of dividends on\nany securities which rank equally with the\nCapital One\npreferred stock of a series, if any, unless\nCapital One has paid or set apart funds for\nthe payment of dividends on such Capital One\npreferred stock. When dividends are not paid\nin full upon the shares of such Capital One\npreferred stock and parity\nstock, if any, all dividends declared upon\nshares of such Capital One preferred stock and\nparity stock, if any, will be declared on a\nproportional basis so that the amount of\ndividends declared per share will bear to each\nother the same ratio that\naccrued dividends for the then-current\ndividend period per share on such Capital One\npreferred stock, and accrued dividends,\nincluding any accumulations, if any, on parity\nstock, if any, bear to each other.\n\nAs used in this section, \u0093junior stock\u0094 means\nCapital One common stock and any other class\nor series of stock of Capital One\nhereafter authorized over which Capital One\npreferred stock has preference or priority in\nthe payment of dividends or in the\ndistribution of assets on any liquidation,\ndissolution or winding-up of Capital One.\n\nAs used in this section, \u0093parity stock\u0094 means\nany other class or series of stock of Capital\nOne that ranks on a parity with the\nCapital One preferred stock in the payment of\ndividends and in the distribution of assets on\nany liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of\nCapital One. Each series of Capital One\npreferred stock ranks on a\nparity with each other series of Capital One\npreferred stock.\n\nAs used in this section, \u0093senior stock\u0094 means\nany other class or\nseries of stock of Capital One ranking senior\nto the Capital One preferred stock with\nrespect to payment of dividends or the\ndistribution of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding-up of Capital One.\n\nSubject to the considerations described above,\nand not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash,\nstock or otherwise), as may be determined\nby the Capital One board of directors or a\nduly authorized committee thereof, may be\ndeclared and paid on Capital One common stock\nand any other stock ranking equally with or\njunior to the Capital One preferred stock from\ntime to time out of any\nassets legally available for such payment, and\nthe holders of Capital One preferred stock\nwill not be entitled to participate in any\nsuch dividend.\n\nDividends on the Capital One preferred stock\nwill not be declared, paid or set aside for\npayment to the extent such act would cause\nCapital\nOne to fail to comply with applicable laws and\nregulations, including applicable capital\nadequacy guidelines.\n\n147\n\nRedemption Optional Redemption The Capital One\npreferred stock is not subject to any\nmandatory redemption, sinking fund or other\nsimilar provisions. Capital One may redeem the\nCapital One preferred stock at its option, in\nwhole or in part, from time to time, on any\ndividend payment date on or after (i) December\n1, 2024, with respect to the Capital One\nseries I preferred stock, (ii) June 1, 2025,\nwith respect to the Capital One series J\npreferred stock, (iii) December 1, 2025, with\nrespect to the Capital One series K preferred\nstock, (iv) September 1, 2026, with respect to\nthe Capital One series L preferred stock, (v)\nSeptember 1, 2026, with respect to the Capital\nOne series M preferred stock and (vi)\nSeptember 1, 2026, with respect to the Capital\nOne series N preferred stock, in each case at\na redemption price equal to $1,000 per share\n(equivalent to $25 per Capital One depositary\nshare, to the extent applicable), plus any\ndeclared and unpaid dividends. Neither the\nholders of a series of Capital One preferred\nstock nor holders of the related Capital One\ndepositary shares will have the right to\nrequire the redemption or repurchase of such\nCapital One preferred stock. Redemption\nFollowing a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event\nCapital One may redeem shares of a series of\nCapital One preferred stock at any time within\nninety (90) days following a regulatory\ncapital treatment event, in whole but not in\npart, at a redemption price equal to $1,000\nper share (equivalent to $25 per Capital One\ndepositary share, to the extent applicable)\nplusany declared and unpaid dividends on the\nshares of such Capital One preferred stock\ncalled for redemption up to the redemption\ndate. A \u0093regulatory capital treatment event\u0094\nmeans, for purposes of this section, the good\nfaith determination by Capital One that, as a\nresult of (i) any amendment to, or change\n(including any announced prospective change)\nin, the laws or regulations of the United\nStates or any political subdivision of or in\nthe United States that is enacted or becomes\neffective after the initial issuance of any\nshare of such Capital One preferred stock;\n(ii) any proposed change in those laws or\nregulations that is announced or becomes\neffective after the initial issuance of any\nshare of such Capital One preferred stock; or\n(iii) any official administrative decision or\njudicial decision or administrative action or\nother official pronouncement interpreting or\napplying those laws or regulations that is\nannounced after the initial issuance of any\nshare of such Capital One preferred stock,\nthere is more than an insubstantial risk that\nCapital One will not be entitled to treat the\nfull liquidation value of the shares of such\nCapital One preferred stock then outstanding\nas \u0093Tier 1 Capital\u0094 (or its equivalent) for\npurposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of\nFederal Reserve Regulation Y (or, as and if\napplicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or\nregulations of any successor appropriate\nfederal banking regulator or agency), as then\nin effect and applicable, for as long as any\nshare of such Capital One preferred stock is\noutstanding. Dividends will cease to accrue on\nthose shares on the redemption date.\nRedemption of a series of Capital One\npreferred stock is subject to Capital One\u0092s\nreceipt of any required prior approvals from\nthe Federal Reserve Board and to the\nsatisfaction of any conditions set forth in\nthe capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve\nBoard applicable to the redemption of the\nCapital One preferred stock. Redemption\nProcedures If shares of a series of Capital\nOne preferred stock are to be redeemed, then\nthe notice of redemption will be sent to the\nholders of record of such Capital One\npreferred stock to be redeemed, sent (i) not\nless than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty\n(60) days (in the case of the Capital One\nseries L preferred stock, and the Capital One\nseries N preferred stock), (ii) not less than\nfifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60)\ndays (in the case of the Capital One series I\npreferred stock, the Capital One series J\npreferred stock, and the Capital One series K\npreferred stock), or (iii) not less than ten\n(10) days nor more than sixty (60) days (in\nthe case of the Capital One series M preferred\nstock), prior to the date fixed for redemption\nthereof (provided that, if the Capital One\npreferred stock or Capital One depositary\nshares representing such Capital One preferred\nstock are held in book-entry form through the\nDepository Trust Company (\u0093DTC\u0094), Capital One\nmay give such notice in any manner permitted\nby DTC). Each notice of redemption will\ninclude a statement setting forth:\n                            \n      the redemption date;  \n                            \n148\n                                              \n      the number of shares of such Capital    \n      One preferred stock to be redeemed      \n      and, if less than all the shares held   \n      by                                      \n      the holder are to be redeemed, then     \n      the number of shares of such Capital    \n      One preferred stock to be redeemed      \n      from the holder;                        \n                                              \n                                 \n      the redemption price; and  \n                                 \n                                              \n      the place or places where the           \n      certificates evidencing shares of such  \n      Capital One preferred stock are to be   \n      surrendered for payment of the          \n      redemption price.                       \n                                              \nOn and after the redemption date, dividends\nwill cease to accrue on shares of such Capital\nOne preferred stock, and such shares of\nCapital One preferred stock will no longer be\ndeemed outstanding and all rights of the\nholders of such shares will terminate,\nincluding rights described below in the\nsection entitled \u0093\u0097 Voting Rights,\u0094 except the\nright to receive the redemption price plusany\ndeclared and unpaid dividends. See the section\nentitled \u0093\u0097 Depositary Shares\u0094 below for\ninformation about redemption of the Capital\nOne depositary shares relating to the Capital\nOne preferred stock. In case of any redemption\nof only part of the shares of a series of\nCapital One preferred stock at the time\noutstanding, the shares to be redeemed will be\nselected pro rata or by lot. Subject to the\nterms described herein, the Capital One board\nof directors will have full power and\nauthority to prescribe the terms and\nconditions upon which shares of such series of\nCapital One preferred stock will be redeemed\nfrom time to time. Under the Federal Reserve\nBoard\u0092s current risk-based capital guidelines\napplicable to bank holding companies, any\nredemption of a series of Capital One\npreferred stock is subject to prior approval\nby the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption\nof a series of Capital One preferred stock is\nsubject to Capital One\u0092s receipt of any\nrequired prior approval by the Federal Reserve\nBoard and to the satisfaction of any\nconditions set forth in the capital guidelines\nor regulations of the Federal Reserve Board\napplicable to redemption of such series of\nCapital One preferred stock. Neither the\nholders of a series of Capital One preferred\nstock nor the holders of the related Capital\nOne depositary shares have the right to\nrequire the redemption or repurchase of such\nCapital One preferred stock. Liquidation\nRights In the event Capital One liquidates,\ndissolves or winds up its business and\naffairs, either voluntarily or involuntarily,\nthen holders of the Capital One preferred\nstock are entitled to receive a liquidating\ndistribution of $1,000 per share (equivalent\nto $25 per Capital One depositary share, to\nthe extent applicable), plusany declared and\nunpaid dividends, without accumulation of any\nundeclared dividends before Capital One makes\nany distribution of assets to Capital One\nstockholders or any other class or series of\nshares ranking junior to the Capital One\npreferred stock. Holders of the Capital One\npreferred stock will not be entitled to any\nother amounts from Capital One after they have\nreceived their full liquidating distribution.\nIn any such distribution, if the assets of\nCapital One are not sufficient to pay the\nliquidation preferences plus declared and\nunpaid dividends in full to all holders of the\nCapital One preferred stock and all holders of\nparity stock, if any, as to such distribution\nwith the Capital One preferred stock, the\namounts paid to the holders of Capital One\npreferred stock and parity stock, if any, will\nbe paid pro rata in accordance with the\nrespective aggregate liquidating distribution\nowed to those holders. If the liquidation\npreference plus declared and unpaid dividends\nhas been paid in full to all holders of\nCapital One preferred stock and parity stock,\nif any, then the holders of junior stock will\nbe entitled to receive all remaining assets of\nCapital One according to their respective\nrights and preferences. In addition, Capital\nOne, subject to the discretion of its board of\ndirectors, will generally be able to pay\ndividends and distributions upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding-uponly out of lawfully\navailable assets for such payment (after\nsatisfaction of all claims for indebtedness\nand other non-equityclaims). Further, the\nCapital 149\n\nOne preferred stock may be fully subordinated\nto interests held by the U.S. government in\nthe event that Capital One enters into a\nreceivership, insolvency, liquidation, or\nsimilar proceeding,\nincluding a proceeding under the Orderly\nLiquidation Authority of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nFor purposes of this section, the merger or\nconsolidation of Capital One with any other\nentity, including a merger or consolidation in\nwhich the holders of Capital One preferred\nstock receive cash, securities or property for\ntheir shares, or the sale, lease or exchange\nof all or substantially\nall of the assets of Capital One for cash,\nsecurities or other property, will not\nconstitute a liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding-up of Capital One.\n\nBecause Capital One is a holding company,\nCapital One\u0092s rights and the rights of Capital\nOne\u0092s creditors and Capital One\u0092s\nstockholders, including the holders of the\nCapital One preferred stock, to participate in\nthe assets of any of Capital One\u0092s\nsubsidiaries, including Capital One Bank upon\nthat subsidiary\u0092s liquidation or\nrecapitalization may be subject to\nthe prior claims of that subsidiary\u0092s\ncreditors, except to the extent that Capital\nOne is a creditor with recognized claims\nagainst the subsidiary.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nExcept as provided below, the holders of the\nCapital One preferred stock will have no\nvoting rights.\n\nRight to Elect Two Directors upon Nonpayment\n\nIf Capital One fails to pay, or declare and\nset apart for payment, dividends on\noutstanding shares of a series of Capital One\npreferred stock\nfor six (6) quarterly dividend periods,\nwhether or not consecutive, then the number of\ndirectors on the Capital One board of\ndirectors will be increased by two at Capital\nOne\u0092s first annual meeting of the stockholders\nheld thereafter, and\nat such meeting and at each subsequent annual\nmeeting until continuous noncumulative\ndividends for at least one (1) year on all\noutstanding shares of such Capital One\npreferred stock entitled thereto have been\npaid, or declared and set apart\nfor payment, in full, the holders of shares of\nsuch Capital One preferred stock will have the\nright, voting separately as a class together\nwith holders of any other equally ranked\nseries of Capital One preferred stock that\nhave similar voting\nrights, if any, to elect such two additional\nmembers of the Capital One board of directors\nto hold office for a term of one (1) year;\nprovided that the Capital One board of\ndirectors will at no time include more than\ntwo additional directors\nelected by holders of shares of all series of\nthe Capital One preferred stock and any other\nequally ranked series of Capital One preferred\nstock having similar voting rights, if any,\nvoting together as one class. Upon such\npayment, or such\ndeclaration and setting apart for payment, in\nfull, the terms of the two additional\ndirectors so elected will forthwith terminate,\nand the number of directors will be reduced by\ntwo, and such voting right of the holders of\nshares of Capital One\npreferred stock will cease, subject to\nincrease in the number of directors as\ndescribed above and to revesting of such\nvoting right in the event of each and every\nadditional failure in the payment of dividends\nfor six quarterly dividend periods,\nwhether or not consecutive, as described\nabove.\n\nIn addition, if and when the rights of holders\nof Capital One preferred stock terminate\nfor any reason, including under circumstances\ndescribed above in the section entitled\n\u0093\u0097Redemption,\u0094 such voting rights will\nterminate along with the other rights (except,\nif applicable, the right to receive the\nredemption\nprice plus any declared and unpaid dividends),\nand the terms of any additional directors\nelected by the holders of Capital One\npreferred stock and any other equally ranked\nseries of preferred stock having similar\nvoting rights, if any, will\nterminate automatically and the number of\ndirectors reduced by two, assuming that the\nrights of holders of such equally ranked\nseries of preferred stock have similarly\nterminated.\n\nUnder regulations adopted by the Federal\nReserve Board, if the holders of any series of\npreferred stock are or become entitled to vote\nseparately for the election of directors as a\nclass, such series, along with any other\nholders of stock that are entitled to vote for\nthe election of directors with that series,\nwill be deemed a class of voting securities. A\ncompany holding 25% or\nmore of that class, or less if it otherwise\nexercises a \u0093controlling influence\u0094 over\nCapital One, will be subject to regulation as\na bank holding company under the BHC Act. In\n\n150\n\naddition, at the time the series is deemed a\nclass of voting securities, any other bank\nholding company or systemically significant\nnonbank financial company will be required to\nobtain the prior approval of the Federal\nReserve Board under the BHC Act to acquire or\nretain more than 5% of that class. Any other\nperson (other than a bank holding company or\nsystemically significant nonbank financial\ncompany) will be required to obtain the non-\nobjectionof the Federal Reserve Board under\nthe Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as\namended, to acquire or retain 10% or more of\nthat class. Other Voting Rights So long as any\nshares of Capital One preferred stock of a\nseries remain outstanding, the affirmative\nvote or consent of the holders of at least\ntwo-thirdsof all outstanding shares of such\nCapital One preferred stock, voting separately\nas a class, will be required to:\n                                              \n      authorize or increase the authorized    \n      amount of, or issue shares of, any      \n      class or series of senior stock, or     \n      issue                                   \n      any obligation or security convertible  \n      into or evidencing the right to         \n      purchase any such shares;               \n                                              \n                                              \n      amend the provisions of the Capital     \n      One charter so as to adversely affect   \n      the powers, preferences, privileges or  \n      rights of such Capital One preferred    \n      stock, taken as a whole; provided,      \n      however, that any increase in the       \n      amount of the authorized or issued      \n      preferred stock or authorized common    \n      stock or preferred stock or the         \n      creation and issuance, or an increase   \n      in the authorized or issued amount, of  \n      other series of preferred stock         \n      ranking equally with or junior to such  \n      Capital One preferred stock with        \n      respect to the payment of dividends     \n      (whether such dividends are cumulative  \n      or non-cumulative) or the distribution  \n      of assets upon liquidation,             \n      dissolution or winding-up of Capital    \n      One will not be deemed to adversely     \n      affect the powers, preferences,         \n      privileges or rights of such Capital    \n      One preferred stock; or                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      consummate a binding share-exchange or  \n      reclassification involving such         \n      Capital One preferred stock, or a       \n      merger                                  \n      or Capital One\u0092s consolidation with or   \n      into another entity unless (i)\u00a0the      \n      shares of such Capital One preferred    \n      stock remain outstanding or are         \n      converted into or exchanged for         \n      preference securities of the new        \n      surviving entity and                    \n      (ii)\u00a0the shares of the remaining        \n      Capital One preferred stock of such     \n      series or new preferred securities      \n      have terms that are not materially      \n      less favorable than such Capital One    \n      preferred stock.                        \n                                              \nThe foregoing will not apply if, at or prior\nto the time when the act with respect to which\nsuch vote would otherwise be required will be\neffected, all outstanding shares of such\nCapital One preferred stock have been\nredeemed. Voting Rights under Delaware Law\nDelaware law provides that the holders of\nCapital One preferred stock will have the\nright to vote separately as a class on any\namendment to the Capital One charter that\nwould increase or decrease the aggregate\nnumber of authorized shares of such class,\nincrease or decrease the par value of the\nshares of such class, or alter or change the\npowers, preferences, or special rights of the\nshares of such class so as to affect them\nadversely. If any such proposed amendment\nwould alter or change the powers, preferences\nor special rights of one or more series of\nCapital One preferred stock so as to affect\nthem adversely, but would not so affect the\nentire class of preferred stock, only the\nshares of the series so affected will be\nconsidered a separate class for purposes of\nthis vote on the amendment. This right is in\naddition to any voting rights that may be\nprovided for in the Capital One charter.\nPreemptive and Conversion Rights The holders\nof the Capital One preferred stock do not have\nany preemptive or conversion rights. 151\n\nDepositary Shares\n\nGeneral\n\nThe\nCapital One depositary shares represent\nproportional fractional interests in shares of\nthe applicable series of Capital One preferred\nstock. Each Capital One depositary share\nrepresents a 1/40th interest in a share of the\napplicable series of\nCapital One preferred stock, and is evidenced\nby depositary receipts. Capital One has\ndeposited the underlying shares of the\napplicable Capital One preferred stock with\nthe depositary pursuant to the Deposit\nAgreements. Subject to the terms of the\nDeposit Agreements, each holder of a Capital\nOne depositary share is entitled, through the\ndepositary, in proportion to the applicable\nfraction of a share of Capital One preferred\nstock represented by such Capital One\ndepositary share, to all the\nrights and preferences of the Capital One\npreferred stock represented thereby (including\ndividend, voting, redemption and liquidation\nrights).\n\nIn this section, references to \u0093holders\u0094 of\nCapital One depositary shares mean those who\nown Capital One depositary shares\nregistered in their own names on the books\nthat Capital One or the depositary maintain\nfor this purpose, and not indirect holders who\nown beneficial interests in Capital One\ndepositary shares registered in street name or\nissued in book-entry form\nthrough DTC. Please review the special\nconsiderations that apply to indirect holders\ndescribed below in the section entitled\n\u0093\u0097Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement.\u0094\n\nFollowing the issuance the Capital One series\nI preferred stock, the Capital One series J\npreferred stock, the Capital One K preferred\nstock,\nthe Capital One Series L preferred stock and\nthe Capital One Series N preferred stock,\nCapital One deposited such Capital One\npreferred stock with the depositary, which\nthen issued the Capital One depositary shares.\n\nDividends and Other Distributions\n\nEach dividend payable on a Capital One\ndepositary share will be in an amount equal to\n1/40th of the dividend declared and payable on\nthe\nrelated share of the Capital One preferred\nstock.\n\nThe depositary will distribute any cash\ndividends or other cash distributions received\nin respect of the deposited Capital One\npreferred stock to the record holders of\nCapital One depositary shares relating to the\nunderlying Capital One preferred stock in\nproportion to the number of Capital One\ndepositary shares held by the holders.\nIf Capital One makes a distribution other than\nin cash, the depositary will distribute any\nproperty received by it to the record holders\nof Capital One depositary shares entitled to\nthose distributions, unless it determines that\nthe distribution\ncannot be made proportionally among those\nholders or that it is not feasible to make a\ndistribution. In that event, the depositary\nmay, with Capital One\u0092s approval, sell the\nproperty and distribute the net proceeds from\nthe sale to the holders\nof the Capital One depositary shares.\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and\nother matters relating to the Capital One\ndepositary\nshares will be the same as the corresponding\nrecord dates for each series of Capital One\npreferred stock.\n\nThe amounts distributed to\nholders of Capital One depositary shares will\nbe reduced by any amounts required to be\nwithheld by the depositary or by Capital One\non account of taxes or other governmental\ncharges. The depositary may refuse to make any\npayment or distribution, or\nany transfer, exchange, or withdrawal of any\nCapital One depositary shares or the shares of\nthe Capital One preferred stock until such\ntaxes or other governmental charges are paid.\n\nRedemption of Depositary Shares\n\nIf Capital One redeems a series of Capital One\npreferred stock represented by Capital One\ndepositary shares, then the related Capital\nOne\ndepositary share will be redeemed from the\nproceeds received by the depositary resulting\nfrom the redemption of such Capital One\npreferred stock held by the depositary. The\nredemption price per Capital One depositary\nshare is expected to be equal to\n1/40th of the redemption price per share\npayable with respect to such Capital One\npreferred stock (or $25 per Capital One\ndepositary share), plus any declared and\nunpaid dividends.\n\n152\n\nWhenever Capital One redeems shares of a\nseries of Capital One preferred stock held by\nthe depositary, the depositary will redeem, as\nof the same redemption date, the number of\nCapital One depositary shares representing\nshares of Capital One preferred stock so\nredeemed. If fewer than all of the outstanding\nCapital One depositary shares of a series are\nredeemed, then the depositary will select the\nCapital One depositary shares of such series\nto be redeemed pro rataor by lot. The\ndepositary will send notice of redemption to\nrecord holders of such Capital One depositary\nshares (i) not less than thirty (30) days nor\nmore than sixty (60) days (in the case of the\nCapital One series L depositary shares, and\nthe Capital One series N depositary shares) or\n(ii) not less than fifteen (15) days nor more\nthan sixty (60) days (in the case of the\nCapital One series I depositary shares, the\nCapital One series J depositary shares, and\nthe Capital One series K depositary shares),\nprior to the date fixed for redemption of such\nCapital One preferred stock and the related\nCapital One depositary shares. Voting the\nPreferred Stock Because each Capital One\ndepositary share represents a 1/40th interest\nin a share of the applicable series of Capital\nOne preferred stock, holders of depositary\nreceipts will be entitled to 1/40th of a vote\nper Capital One depositary share under those\nlimited circumstances in which holders of the\nCapital One preferred stock are entitled to a\nvote. When the depositary receives notice of\nany meeting at which the holders of the\nCapital One preferred stock are entitled to\nvote, the depositary will send the information\ncontained in the notice to the record holders\nof the Capital One depositary shares relating\nto the Capital One preferred stock. Each\nrecord holder of the Capital One depositary\nshares on the record date, which will be the\nsame date as the record date for the Capital\nOne preferred stock, may instruct the\ndepositary to vote the amount of the Capital\nOne preferred stock represented by the\nholder\u0092s Capital One depositary shares. To the\nextent possible, the depositary will vote the\namount of the Capital One preferred stock\nrepresented by Capital One depositary shares\nin accordance with the instructions it\nreceives. Capital One has agreed to take all\nreasonable actions that the depositary\ndetermines are necessary to enable the\ndepositary to vote as instructed. If the\ndepositary does not receive specific\ninstructions from the holders of any Capital\nOne depositary shares representing Capital One\npreferred stock, it will not vote the amount\nof Capital One preferred stock represented by\nsuch Capital One depositary shares. Depositary\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A. is the\ndepositary for the Capital One depositary\nshares. Capital One may, in its sole\ndiscretion, remove the depositary in\naccordance with the agreement between Capital\nOne and the depositary; provided that Capital\nOne will appoint a successor depositary who\nwill accept such appointment prior to the\neffectiveness of its removal. Form of\nPreferred Stock and Depositary Shares The\nCapital One series M preferred stock and the\nCapital One depositary shares have been issued\nin book-entry form through DTC, as described\nbelow in the section entitled \u0093\u0097 Book-Entry\nProcedures and Settlement.\u0094 The Capital One\npreferred stock other than the Capital One\nseries M preferred stock has been issued in\nregistered form to the depositary. Listing of\nDepositary Shares The Capital One depositary\nshares are listed on the New York Stock\nExchange under the following symbols:\n                                              \n      Series I Capital One depositary         \n      shares: \u0093COFPRI\u0094                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Series J Capital One depositary         \n      shares: \u0093COFPRJ\u0094                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Series K Capital One depositary         \n      shares: \u0093COFPRK\u0094                          \n                                              \n153\n                                              \n      Series L Capital One depositary         \n      shares: \u0093COFPRL\u0094                          \n                                              \n                                              \n      Series N Capital One depositary         \n      shares: \u0093COFPRN\u0094                          \n                                              \nBook-Entry Procedures and Settlement Capital\nOne has issued the Capital One depositary\nshares and the Capital One series M preferred\nstock under a book-entry system in the form of\nglobal depositary receipts and global\ncertificates, respectively (collectively,\n\u0093global securities\u0094). Capital One has\nregistered the global securities in the name\nof a nominee for DTC. The global depositary\nreceipts have been deposited with the\ndepositary. DTC is the only registered holder\nof the Capital One series M preferred stock\nand the depositary receipts representing the\nCapital One depositary shares and is\nconsidered the sole owner of the global\ncertificates and depositary receipts for\npurposes of the applicable deposit agreement.\nGlobal securities may be transferred, in whole\nand not in part, only to another nominee of\nDTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee.\nBeneficial interests in the global securities\nmay be held through the Euroclear system\n(\u0093Euroclear\u0094) and Clearstream Banking, S.A.\n(\u0093Clearstream\u0094), each as indirect participants\nin DTC. Transfers of beneficial interests in\nthe global securities are subject to the\napplicable rules and procedures of DTC and its\ndirect and indirect participants, including,\nif applicable, those of Euroclear and\nClearstream, which may change from time to\ntime. Direct participants in DTC\u0092s system\ninclude both U.S. and non-U.S.securities\nbrokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,\nclearing corporations, and certain other\norganizations. Access to DTC\u0092s system also is\navailable to others such as both U.S. and\nnon-U.S.securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies and clearing corporations that\nclear through or maintain a custodial\nrelationship with a direct participant, either\ndirectly or indirectly, which Capital One\ncollectively calls indirect participants.\nPersons that are not participants may\nbeneficially own securities held by or on\nbehalf of DTC only through the participants or\nthe indirect participants. The ownership\ninterests in, and transfers of ownership\ninterests in, each security held by or on\nbehalf of DTC are recorded on the records of\nthe participants and the indirect\nparticipants. The rules applicable to DTC and\nits participants are on file with the SEC.\nOwnership of beneficial interests in the\nglobal securities are limited to participants\nor persons that may hold interests through\nparticipants. Ownership of beneficial\ninterests in the global securities will be\nshown on, and the transfer of those ownership\ninterests may be effected only through,\nrecords maintained by DTC or its nominee (with\nrespect to participants) and the records of\nparticipants and indirect participants (with\nrespect to other owners of beneficial\ninterests in the global securities). All\ninterests in a global depositary receipt,\nincluding those held through Euroclear or\nClearstream, may be subject to the procedures\nand requirements of DTC. Those interests held\nthrough Euroclear or Clearstream may also be\nsubject to the procedures and requirements of\nsuch systems. The laws of some states require\nthat certain purchasers of securities take\nphysical delivery of those securities in\ndefinitive form. These laws may impair the\nability of holders to transfer beneficial\ninterests in depositary receipts or Capital\nOne preferred stock to certain purchasers.\nBecause DTC can act only on behalf of the\nparticipants, which in turn act on behalf of\nthe indirect participants, the ability of a\nperson having beneficial interests in a global\nsecurity to pledge such interests to persons\nthat do not participate in the DTC system, or\notherwise take actions in respect of such\ninterests, may be affected by the lack of a\nphysical certificate evidencing such\ninterests. So long as DTC or any successor\ndepositary for a global security, or any\nnominee, is the registered holder of such\nglobal security, DTC or such successor\ndepositary or nominee will be considered the\nsole owner or holder 154\n\nof the Capital One preferred stock or Capital\nOne depositary shares represented by such\ndepositary receipts for all purposes. Except\nas set forth below, owners of beneficial\ninterests in a global\nsecurity will not be entitled to have Capital\nOne preferred stock or Capital One depositary\nshares represented by such depositary receipt\nregistered in their names, will not receive or\nbe entitled to receive physical delivery of\nCapital One\npreferred stock or Capital One depositary\nshares or depositary receipts in definitive\nform, and will not be considered the owners or\nholders thereof for any purpose. Accordingly,\neach person owning a beneficial interest in a\nglobal security must\nrely on the procedures of DTC and, if such\nperson is not a participant, on the procedures\nof the participant through which such person\nowns its interest, to exercise any rights of a\nholder. Capital One understands that, under\nexisting industry\npractices, in the event that it requests any\naction of holders or that an owner of a\nbeneficial interest in the depositary receipts\nor preferred stock desires to give any consent\nor take any action under the applicable\ndeposit agreement or with\nrespect to such ownership interest, DTC or any\nsuccessor depositary would authorize the\nparticipants holding the relevant beneficial\ninterests to give or take such action or\nconsent, and such participants would authorize\nbeneficial owners owning\nthrough such participants to give or take such\naction or consent or would otherwise act upon\nthe instructions of beneficial owners owning\nthrough them.\n\nPayment of dividends, if any, distributions\nupon liquidation or other distributions with\nrespect to the Capital One depositary shares\nor\nshares of Capital One preferred stock that are\nregistered in the name of or held by DTC or\nany successor depositary or nominee will be\npayable to DTC or such successor depositary or\nnominee, as the case may be, in its capacity\nas registered holder\nof the global securities representing the\nCapital One depositary shares or the Capital\nOne preferred stock. The depositary will treat\nthe persons in whose names the Capital One\ndepositary shares, including the depositary\nreceipts, and the Capital\nOne Series M preferred stock are registered as\nthe owners of such securities for the purpose\nof receiving payments and for all other\npurposes. Consequently, neither Capital One,\nnor any depositary, nor any agent of Capital\nOne or any such depositary\nwill have any responsibility or liability for\nany aspect of the records relating to, or\npayments made on account of, beneficial\nownership interests in the global securities,\nfor maintaining, supervising or reviewing any\nrecords relating to such\nbeneficial ownership interests, or for any\nother matter relating to the actions and\npractices of DTC or any of its participants or\nindirect participants.\n\nCapital One has been advised by DTC that its\ncurrent practice, upon receipt of any payment\nof dividends, distributions upon liquidation\nor\nother distributions with respect to the global\nsecurities, is to credit participants\u0092\naccounts with payments on the payment date,\nunless DTC has reason to believe it will not\nreceive payments on such payment date. Each\nrelevant participant is\ncredited with an amount proportionate to its\nbeneficial ownership of an interest in the\nrelevant security as shown on the records of\nDTC. Payments by participants and indirect\nparticipants to owners of beneficial interests\nin the global securities\nheld through such participants and indirect\nparticipants will be governed by standing\ninstructions and customary practices, as is\nnow the case with securities held for the\naccounts of customers in bearer form or\nregistered in \u0093street name\u0094\nand will be the responsibility of such\nparticipants or indirect participants, and\nwill not be the responsibility of Capital One,\nany depositary, nor any agent of Capital One\nor of any such depositary. Neither Capital One\nnor any such depositary or\nagent will be liable for any delay by DTC or\nby any participant or indirect participant in\nidentifying the beneficial owners of the\nCapital One depositary shares or Capital One\npreferred stock, and Capital One and any such\ndepositary or agent may\nconclusively rely on and will be protected in\nrelying on instructions from DTC or its\nnominee for all purposes.\n\nAlthough DTC, Euroclear\nand Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing\nprocedures to facilitate transfers of\ninterests in the global securities among\nparticipants in DTC, Euroclear and\nClearstream, they are under no obligation to\nperform or to continue to perform such\nprocedures, and may discontinue such\nprocedures at any time. Neither Capital One,\nnor any depositary, nor any agent of Capital\nOne or of any such depositary will have any\nresponsibility for the performance by DTC,\nEuroclear or Clearstream or their\nrespective participants or indirect\nparticipants of their respective obligations\nunder the rules and procedures governing their\noperations.\n\n155\n\nAnti-Takeover Provisions of the Capital One\nCharter and Capital One Bylaws\n\nCertain provisions in the Capital One charter\nand Capital One bylaws could make it more\ndifficult or discourage a tender offer, proxy\ncontest\nor other takeover attempt that is opposed by\nthe Capital One board of directors but which\nmight be favored by the stockholders. Certain\nprovisions are summarized below.\n\nBoard of Directors. The Capital One charter\nand Capital One bylaws provide that, other\nthan directors elected by any series of\nCapital\nOne preferred stock, directors will be elected\nannually to one-year terms in office.\n\nNumber of Directors; Removal; Filling\nVacancies. The Capital One bylaws provide that\nthe Capital One board of directors must\nconsist of between three and seventeen\ndirectors, and vacancies will be filled only\nby the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nremaining directors, even if less than a\nquorum remains in office, unless the Capital\nOne board of directors determines otherwise.\nTherefore, unless the Capital One bylaws are\nfurther amended (or the Capital One board of\ndirectors determines\notherwise), the Capital One board of directors\ncould prevent any stockholder from enlarging\nthe Capital One board of directors and filling\nthe new directorships with the stockholder\u0092s\nown nominees.\n\nUnder Delaware law and the Capital One\ncharter, directors may be removed for or\nwithout cause. The Capital One charter also\nprovides that\ndirectors may only be removed, whether for or\nwithout cause, upon the affirmative vote of\nholders of at least a majority of the voting\npower of the then-outstanding shares of stock\nentitled to vote generally in the election of\ndirectors, voting\ntogether as a single class.\n\nBlank Check Preferred.The Capital One board of\ndirectors is authorized, without stockholder\napproval,\nto create and provide for the issuance of up\nto an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares of\npreferred stock in series, to establish from\ntime to time the number of shares to be\nincluded in each such series, and to fix the\ndesignations, powers, preferences\nand rights of the shares of each such series\nand the qualifications, limitations or\nrestrictions on the shares of each such\nseries.\n\nThe\nauthority to designate preferred stock may be\nused to issue a series of preferred stock, or\nrights to acquire preferred stock, that could\ndilute the interest of, or impair the voting\npower of, holders of the common stock, or be\nused as a method of\ndetermining, delaying or preventing a change\nof control.\n\nStockholder Action by Written Consent; Special\nMeetings. Stockholder\naction can be taken only at an annual or\nspecial meeting of stockholders or by written\nconsent in accordance with the applicable\nprovisions set forth in the Capital One\ncharter and Capital One bylaws. Under\ncircumstances described in the Capital One\ncharter and Capital One bylaws, special\nmeetings of stockholders can be called by the\nchair of the Capital One board of directors or\nby the Capital One board of directors pursuant\nto a resolution adopted by a majority of the\nauthorized number of\ndirectors. Under the Capital One charter,\nstockholders have the right to request that\nCapital One call a special meeting of\nstockholders or to request that stockholder\naction be taken by written consent in lieu of\na meeting, provided in each case\nthat the requesting stockholders own 25% or\nmore of the then-outstanding shares of stock\nentitled to vote on the matters proposed to be\nbrought before the special meeting or the\nactions proposed to be taken by written\nconsent, as applicable, and\nsatisfy certain requirements set forth in the\nCapital One charter and Capital One bylaws.\nThese requirements include a \u0093net long\u0094\ndefinition of stock ownership for purposes of\ndetermining whether stockholders requesting a\nspecial meeting\nor action by written consent satisfy the 25%\nownership threshold, so that only stockholders\nwith full and continuing economic interest and\nvoting rights in Capital One\u0092s stock can\nrequest a special meeting or action by written\nconsent. In\naddition, the Capital One bylaws set forth\ncertain procedural requirements that the\nCapital One board of directors believes are\nappropriate to avoid duplicative or\nunnecessary special meetings or actions by\nwritten consent. Moreover, any special\nmeeting of stockholders is limited to the\nbusiness in the notice of the special meeting\nsent to the stockholders before the meeting,\nincluding any business stated in a valid\nspecial meeting request (in the case of a\nstockholder-requested special\nmeeting).\n\n156\n\nThe ability to take stockholder action by\nwritten consent or to request special meetings\nmay be precluded if stockholders fail to\nsatisfy the requirements in the Capital One\ncharter and Capital One bylaws. You should\nrefer to these documents for more information\nabout the requirements. Advance Notice\nProvisions for Stockholder Nominations and\nStockholder Proposals. Only people who are\nnominated by, or at the direction of, the\nCapital One board of directors, or by a\nstockholder who has given proper written\nnotice prior to a meeting at which directors\nare to be elected, will be eligible for\nelection as directors. Business conducted at\nan annual meeting is limited to the business\nbrought before the meeting by, or at the\ndirection of, the chair of the Capital One\nboard of directors, the Capital One board of\ndirectors or a stockholder who has given\nproper notice. A stockholder\u0092s notice to\nCapital One proposing to nominate a person for\nelection as a director must contain certain\ninformation described in the Capital One\nbylaws and be submitted in compliance with the\ntime frames specified in the Capital One\nbylaws. You should refer to the Capital One\nbylaws for more information, including the\nprocess and timing requirements for a\nstockholder notice. Some of the effects of the\nprovisions described above and in the Capital\nOne bylaws include:\n                                              \n      the Capital One board of directors      \n      will have a longer period to consider   \n      the qualifications of the proposed      \n      nominees or the substance of other      \n      business proposed to be brought before  \n      an annual meeting and, if deemed        \n      necessary or desirable, to inform       \n      stockholders about the Capital One      \n      board of directors\u0092 views on these       \n      matters;                                \n                                              \n                                              \n      there will be an orderly procedure for  \n      conducting annual meetings of           \n      stockholders and informing              \n      stockholders,                           \n      prior to the meetings, of any           \n      nominations or other business proposed  \n      to be conducted at the meetings,        \n      including any Board recommendations;    \n      and                                     \n                                              \n                                              \n      contests for the election of directors  \n      or the consideration of stockholder     \n      proposals will be precluded if the      \n      procedures are not followed. Third      \n      parties may therefore be discouraged    \n      from conducting a solicitation of       \n      proxies to elect their own slate of     \n      directors or to approve their own       \n      proposal.                               \n                                              \nBusiness Combinations. Under the Capital One\ncharter, certain mergers, share exchanges or\nsales of Capital One\u0092s assets with or to\ninterested stockholders, as defined below,\nmust be approved by the affirmative vote of\nthe holders of at least a majority of the\nthen-outstanding shares of stock entitled to\nvote generally in the election of directors,\nvoting together as a single class, including a\nmajority of such stock not owned directly or\nindirectly by any interested stockholder or\nany affiliate of any interested stockholder.\nThe Capital One charter requires this\naffirmative vote even if no vote is required,\nor a lesser percentage is specified, by law or\nany national securities exchange or otherwise.\nThis majority affirmative vote is not required\nin two situations (and a business combination\nwill require only the vote required by law or\nany other applicable provision of the Capital\nOne charter). First, it is not required if the\nbusiness combination has been approved by a\nmajority of uninterested, continuing\ndirectors. Second, it is not required if\ncertain price and procedure requirements\ndesigned to ensure that Capital One\u0092s\nstockholders receive a \u0093fair price\u0094 for their\ncommon stock are satisfied. The Capital One\ncharter defines an interested stockholder as\nany person, other than Capital One or any of\nits subsidiaries, who or which:\n                                              \n      itself, or along with its affiliates,   \n      beneficially owns, directly or          \n      indirectly, more than 5% of the         \n      then-outstanding shares of stock        \n      entitled to vote generally in the       \n      election of directors;                  \n                                              \n                                              \n      is an affiliate of Capital One and at   \n      any time within the two (2)-year        \n      period immediately prior to the date    \n      in                                      \n      question itself or along with its       \n      affiliates beneficially owned,          \n      directly or indirectly, 5% or more of   \n      the then-outstanding shares of stock    \n      entitled to vote generally in the       \n      election of directors; or               \n                                              \n                                              \n      owns any shares of the                  \n      then-outstanding shares of stock        \n      entitled to vote generally in the       \n      election of directors                   \n      which were at any time within the two   \n      (2)-year period immediately prior to    \n      the date in question beneficially       \n      owned by any interested stockholder,    \n      if the transfer of ownership occurred   \n      in the course of a                      \n      non-public transaction or series of     \n      non-public transactions.                \n                                              \n157\n\nLiability of Directors; Indemnification. A\ndirector generally will not be personally\nliable for monetary damages to Capital One or\nCapital One\u0092s stockholders for breach of\nfiduciary duty as a director. A director may\nbe held liable, however, for the following:\n                                              \n      any breach of the director\u0092s duty of     \n      loyalty to Capital One or Capital One   \n      stockholders;                           \n                                              \n                                              \n      acts or omissions not in good faith or  \n      which involve intentional misconduct    \n      or a knowing violation of law;          \n                                              \n                                              \n      paying a dividend or approving a stock  \n      repurchase in violation of Delaware     \n      law; or                                 \n                                              \n                                              \n      any transaction from which the          \n      director derived an improper personal   \n      benefit.                                \n                                              \nCapital One indemnifies and advances expenses\nto its officers and directors in connection\nwith legal proceedings to the fullest extent\nof the law. Capital One may agree with any\nperson to provide an indemnification greater\nthan or different from the indemnification\nprovided by the Capital One charter or the\nCapital One bylaws. Amendments. The Capital\nOne charter provides that amendments to the\nCapital One charter and the Capital One bylaws\ncan be approved by a majority vote of the\nthen-outstanding shares of stock entitled to\nvote generally in the election of directors.\nThe Capital One charter includes a majority\nvoting provision that applies to the amendment\nor repeal of, or the adoption of any provision\ninconsistent with, the provisions of the\nCapital One charter related to business\ncombinations, which can only be amended with\nan affirmative vote of the holders of at least\na majority of the then-outstanding shares of\nstock entitled to vote generally in the\nelection of directors, including the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority\nof the then-outstanding shares of such stock\nnot owned directly or indirectly by any\ninterested stockholder or any affiliate of any\ninterested stockholder. The Capital One bylaws\ngenerally may be amended by the Capital One\nboard of directors or by the stockholders;\nprovided that in the case of amendments by the\nstockholders the affirmative vote of at least\na majority of the then-outstanding shares of\nstock entitled to vote generally in the\nelection of directors is required. These vote\nrequirements may have the effect of preventing\na stockholder with less than a majority of the\ncommon stock from circumventing the\nrequirements of the Capital One bylaws or a\nstockholder with only a majority of the common\nstock from circumventing certain provisions of\nthe Capital One charter by simply amending or\nrepealing them. Anti-Takeover Legislation\nCapital One has elected not to be subject to\nthe provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL.\nThis provision generally states that, subject\nto certain exceptions, a corporation cannot\nengage in any business combination with any\n\u0093interested stockholder\u0094 for three (3) years\nafter the time that the stockholder became an\ninterested stockholder unless the business\ncombination is approved by the board of\ndirectors and authorized by the affirmative\nvote of at least 66-2/3%of the outstanding\nvoting stock of the corporation which is not\nowned by the interested stockholder. Delaware\nlaw defines an interested stockholder to\ninclude any person, and its affiliates and\nassociates, that owns 15% or more of the\noutstanding voting stock of the corporation,\nor that is an affiliate or associate of the\ncorporation and was the owner of 15% or more\nof the outstanding voting stock of the\ncorporation at any time within three (3) years\nimmediately prior to the relevant date.\nBusiness combinations are discussed more fully\nabove. Exclusive Forum The Capital One bylaws\nprovide that, unless Capital One consents in\nwriting to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law,\nand subject to applicable jurisdictional\nrequirements, the sole and exclusive forum for\nany stockholder (including any beneficial\nowner) to bring internal corporate claims (as\ndefined below) will be a state court located\nwithin the State of Delaware (or, if no state\ncourt located within the State of Delaware has\njurisdiction, the federal district court for\nthe District of Delaware). For purposes of\nthis provision, \u0093internal corporate claims\u0094\nmeans claims, including claims in the right of\nthe Company: (a) that are based upon a\nviolation of a duty by a current or former\ndirector, officer, employee or stockholder in\nsuch capacity, or (b) as to which the DGCL\nconfers jurisdiction upon the Delaware Court\nof Chancery. 158\n\nDESCRIPTION OF NEW CAPITAL ONE PREFERRED STOCK\n\nAt the second effective time, by virtue of the\nsecond step merger and without any action on\nthe part of Capital One, Discover or any\nholder of the Discover preferred stock or the\nnew Capital One preferred stock, each share of\nDiscover series C preferred stock and Discover\nseries D preferred stock, in each case issued\nand outstanding immediately prior to the\nsecond effective time, will be converted into\nthe right to receive one (1) share of Capital\nOne series O preferred stock or Capital One\nseries P preferred stock, respectively. The\nfollowing briefly summarizes the terms and\nprovisions of the new Capital One preferred\nstock. This summary contains a description of\nthe material terms of the new Capital One\npreferred stock, and it is qualified in its\nentirety by reference to the Capital One\ncharter, including the certificates of\ndesignations creating each series of the new\nCapital One preferred stock, the applicable\ndeposit agreements for each series of Discover\npreferred stock, which Capital One will assume\nupon completion of the mergers, and the\napplicable provisions of Delaware law and\nfederal law governing bank holding companies.\nThe terms defined in this section shall only\nbe used as such for the purposes of this\nsection.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Capital One charter\ncurrently authorizes the Capital One board of\ndirectors, without further stockholder action,\nto cause Capital One to issue up to 50,000,000\nshares of Capital One preferred stock, par\nvalue $0.01 per share, in series, to establish\nfrom time to time\nthe number of shares to be included in each\nsuch series, and to fix the designations,\npowers, preferences and rights of the shares\nof each such series. The Capital One charter\nmay be amended from time to time to increase\nthe number of authorized\nshares of Capital One preferred stock. Any\nsuch amendment would require the affirmative\nvote of the holders of at least a majority of\nthe voting power of the shares of then-\noutstanding capital stock entitled to vote\ngenerally in the election of\ndirectors. As of the date of this joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus, there are 4,975,000\nshares of Capital One preferred stock issued\nand outstanding.\n\nIn connection with the second step merger,\neach share of Discover series C preferred\nstock and Discover series D preferred stock,\nin each case\nissued and outstanding immediately prior to\nthe second effective time, will be converted\ninto the right to receive one (1) share of\nCapital One series O preferred stock or\nCapital One series P preferred stock,\nrespectively. Capital One\nwill file a certificate of designations\nclassifying and designating 5,700 shares of\nauthorized but unissued Capital One preferred\nstock as Capital One series O preferred stock\nand 5,000 shares of authorized but unissued\nCapital One preferred\nstock as Capital One series P preferred stock,\nin each case, with the preferences,\ndesignations, rights and other terms as\ndescribed below.\n\nNew Capital One Series O Preferred Stock\n\nRank\n\nWith respect to the payment of dividends and\ndistribution of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution, or\nwinding-up of Capital One, the new Capital One\nseries O preferred stock (the \u0093Capital One\nseries O preferred stock\u0094) will rank (i)\nsenior to Capital One common stock and to any\nother class or\nseries of capital stock of Capital One, other\nthan each series of Capital One preferred\nstock and the Capital One series P preferred\nstock, that, by its terms, does not expressly\nprovide that it ranks on parity with the new\nCapital One series O\npreferred stock and (ii) on a parity with each\nseries of Capital One preferred stock, the\nCapital One series P preferred stock and any\nother class or series of capital stock of\nCapital One that, by its terms, expressly\nprovides that it ranks on\nparity with the Capital One series O preferred\nstock. Capital One may authorize and issue\nadditional shares of Capital One series O\njunior securities (the \u0093Capital One series O\njunior securities\u0094) and Capital One series O\nparity\nsecurities (the \u0093Capital One series O parity\nsecurities\u0094) without the consent of the\nholders of the Capital One series O preferred\nstock.\n\nThe holders of shares of the new Capital One\nseries O preferred stock will not have any\nrights to convert such shares into shares of\nany other\nclass or series of securities of Capital One.\n\n159\n\nDividends and Other Distributions\n\nHolders of Capital One series O preferred\nstock will be entitled to receive, when, as\nand if declared by the Capital One board of\ndirectors or\na duly authorized committee thereof, out of\nassets legally available for the payment of\ndividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative\ncash dividends based on the liquidation\npreference of the Capital One series\nO preferred stock at a rate equal to 5.500%\nper annum for each series O dividend period\nfrom, and including, the last dividend payment\ndate in respect of the Discover series C\npreferred stock prior to its conversion to\nCapital One series O preferred\nstock to, but excluding, October 30, 2027 (the\n\u0093fixed rate period\u0094). From and including\nOctober 30, 2027 and thereafter, dividends\nwill accrue and be payable at a floating rate\nequal to three-month Term Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (\u0093SOFR\u0094) (as administered by\nCME Group Benchmark Administration, Ltd. (or a\nsuccessor administrator)) plus a spread of\n3.338% per annum (the \u0093floating rate period\u0094).\nIf Capital One issues additional shares\nof the Capital One series O preferred stock\nafter the original issue date of the Capital\nOne series O preferred stock, then dividends\non such shares will accrue from the later of\nsuch original issue date or the series O\ndividend payment date,\nif any, immediately prior to the original\nissue date of such additional shares.\n\nThe \u0093series O dividend payment date\u0094 refers to\nthe fixed rate dividend payment date or the\nfloating rate dividend payment date, as\napplicable, each as defined below. The \u0093series\nO dividend period\u0094 refers to the period from\nand including a series O dividend payment date\nto but excluding\nthe next series O dividend payment date,\nexcept that the initial Series O dividend\nperiod will commence on and include the last\ndividend payment date in respect of the\nDiscover series C preferred stock prior to its\nconversion to Capital One series O\npreferred stock.\n\nThe dividend rate for each dividend period in\nthe floating rate period will be determined by\nthe calculation agent using\nthree-month Term SOFR as in effect on the\nseries O dividend determination date for the\ndividend period. The calculation agent then\nwill add three-month Term SOFR as determined\non the dividend determination date and the\nspread of 3.338% per annum.\nThe \u0093series O dividend determination date\u0094\nmeans, for each series O dividend period\nduring the floating rate period, the second\nday on which dealings in deposits in U.S.\ndollars are transacted in the London interbank\nmarket immediately\npreceding the first day of such series O\ndividend period or, if the three-month Term\nSOFR is not available as of such date, the\ndate of the most recently available\npublication of the three-month Term SOFR.\n\nAbsent manifest error, the calculation agent\u0092s\ndetermination of the dividend rate for a\ndividend period will be binding and conclusive\non\nholders of the Capital One series O preferred\nstock, the transfer agent for the Capital One\nseries O preferred stock, and Capital One.\n\nIf\ndeclared by the Capital One board of directors\nor a duly authorized committee thereof,\ndividends payable on the Capital One series O\npreferred stock for any dividend period during\nthe fixed rate period will be paid semi-\nannually, in arrears, on\nApril 30 and October 30 of each year, ending\non October 30, 2027 (each such date, a \u0093fixed\nrate dividend payment date\u0094). Dividends\npayable on the Capital One series O preferred\nstock for any dividend period during the\nfloating rate period will be paid quarterly,\nin arrears, on January 30, April 30, July 30\nand October 30 of each year, commencing on\nJanuary 30, 2028 (each such date, a \u0093floating\nrate dividend payment date\u0094). If\nany fixed rate dividend payment date up to and\nincluding the scheduled October 30, 2027 fixed\nrate dividend payment date is not a business\nday, then the payment will be made on the next\nbusiness day without any adjustment to the\namount of\ndividends paid. If any floating rate dividend\npayment date thereafter is not a business day,\nthen such floating rate dividend payment date\nwill be postponed to the next succeeding\nbusiness day, unless that day falls in the\nnext calendar month, in\nwhich case the floating rate dividend payment\ndate will be brought forward to the\nimmediately preceding business day, and, in\neither case, dividends will accrue to, but\nexcluding, the actual payment date.\n\nDividends will be payable to holders of record\nof Capital One series O preferred stock as\nthey appear on Capital One\u0092s stock register on\nthe applicable record date, which shall be the\n15th calendar day before the applicable\ndividend payment date, or such other record\ndate, no earlier than 30 calendar days before\nthe\n\n160\n\napplicable dividend payment date, as shall be\nfixed by the Capital One board of directors or\na duly authorized committee thereof. Dividends\npayable on Capital One series O preferred\nstock during the fixed rate period will be\ncomputed on the basis of a 360-dayyear\nconsisting of twelve 30-daymonths. Dividends\npayable on Capital One series O preferred\nstock during the floating rate period will be\ncomputed based on the actual number of days in\na series O dividend period and a 360-dayyear.\nDollar amounts resulting from that calculation\nwill be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-\nhalfcent being rounded upwards. Dividends on\nthe Capital One series O preferred stock will\ncease to accrue on the redemption date, if\nany, unless Capital One defaults in the\npayment of the redemption price of the Capital\nOne series O preferred stock called for\nredemption. Dividends on the Capital One\nseries O preferred stock will not be\ncumulative. If the Capital One board of\ndirectors or a duly authorized committee\nthereof does not declare a dividend on the\nCapital One series O preferred stock in\nrespect of a dividend period, then no dividend\nwill be deemed to have accrued for such\ndividend period, be payable on the applicable\ndividend payment date or be cumulative, and\nCapital One will have no obligation to pay any\ndividend for that dividend period, whether or\nnot the Capital One board of directors or a\nduly authorized committee of the Capital One\nboard of directors declares a dividend for any\nfuture dividend period with respect to the\nCapital One series O preferred stock, Capital\nOne\u0092s common stock, or any other class or\nseries of preferred stock of Capital One.

When dividends are not paid\nin full upon the shares of Capital One series\nO preferred stock and parity securities, if\nany, all dividends declared upon shares of\nCapital One series O preferred stock and\nparity securities, if any, will be declared on\na proportional basis so that the amount of\ndividends declared per share will bear to each\nother the same ratio that accrued dividends\nfor the then-current dividend period per share\non Capital One series O preferred stock, and\naccrued dividends, including any\naccumulations, if any, on parity securities,\nif any, bear to each other.

Dividends\non the Capital One series O preferred stock\nwill not be declared, paid or set aside for\npayment to the extent such act would cause\nCapital One to fail to comply with applicable\nlaws and regulations, including applicable\ncapital adequacy guidelines. Redemption The\nnew Capital One series O preferred stock will\nbe perpetual and have no maturity date. The\nnew Capital One series O preferred stock will\nnot be subject to any mandatory redemption,\nsinking fund or other similar provisions. The\nnew Capital One series O preferred stock will\nbe redeemable at the option of Capital One, in\nwhole or in part, from time to time, on any\ndividend payment date on or after October 30,\n2027 (or, if not a business day, the next\nsucceeding business day), at a redemption\nprice equal to $100,000 per share of Capital\nOne series O preferred stock, plusany declared\nand unpaid dividends, without regard to any\nundeclared dividends, on the shares of new\nCapital One series O preferred stock called\nfor redemption to, but excluding, the\nredemption date. Holders of Capital One series\nO preferred stock will have no right to\nrequire the redemption or repurchase of\nCapital One series O preferred stock.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, within ninety\n(90) days following the occurrence of a\nregulatory capital treatment event, Capital\nOne, at its option, may redeem at any time all\n(but not less than all) of the shares of the\nCapital One series O preferred stock at the\ntime outstanding, at a redemption price equal\nto $100,000 per share of Capital One series O\npreferred stock, plusany declared and unpaid\ndividends, without regard to any undeclared\ndividends, on the shares of Capital One series\nO preferred stock called for redemption to,\nbut excluding, the redemption date, upon\nnotice given. A \u0093regulatory capital treatment\nevent\u0094 means, for purposes of this section,\nthe good faith determination by Capital One\nthat, as a result of (1) any amendment to, or\nchange (including any announced prospective\nchange) in, the laws or regulations of the\nUnited States or any political subdivision of\nor in the United States that is enacted or\nbecomes effective after the initial issuance\nof any share of Capital One series O preferred\nstock; (2) any proposed change in those laws\nor regulations that is announced or becomes\neffective after the initial issuance of any\nshare of Capital One series O preferred stock;\nor (3) any official administrative decision or\njudicial decision or administrative action or\nother official pronouncement interpreting or\napplying those laws or 162\n\nregulations that is announced after the\ninitial issuance of any share of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock, there is more than\nan insubstantial risk that Capital One will\nnot be entitled to\ntreat the full liquidation value of the shares\nof Capital One series O preferred stock then\noutstanding as \u0093additional Tier 1 Capital\u0094 (or\nits equivalent) for purposes of the capital\nadequacy guidelines of Federal Reserve Board\nRegulation\nQ (or, as and if applicable, the capital\nadequacy guidelines or regulations of any\nsuccessor appropriate federal banking\nregulator or agency), as then in effect and\napplicable, for as long as any share of\nCapital One series O preferred stock is\noutstanding.\n\nIf shares of Capital One series O preferred\nstock are to be redeemed, the notice of\nredemption shall be given by first class\nmail to the holders of record of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock to be redeemed,\nmailed not less than ten (10) days nor more\nthan sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed\nfor redemption thereof (provided that, if the\ndepositary shares\nrepresenting Capital One series O preferred\nstock are held in book-entry form through DTC,\nCapital One may give such notice in any manner\npermitted by DTC). Each notice of redemption\nwill include a statement setting forth: (1)\nthe redemption\ndate; (2) the number of shares of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock to be redeemed and,\nif less than all the shares held by such\nholder are to be redeemed, the number of such\nshares to be redeemed from such holder; (3)\nthe redemption\nprice; and (4) the place or places where the\ncertificates evidencing shares of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock are to be surrendered\nfor payment of the redemption price. On and\nafter the redemption date, dividends will\ncease to accrue on\nshares of Capital One series O preferred\nstock, and such shares of Capital One series O\npreferred stock shall no longer be deemed\noutstanding and all rights of the holders of\nsuch shares will terminate, except the right\nto receive the redemption\nprice plus any declared and unpaid dividends,\nwithout regard to any undeclared dividends, on\nsuch shares of Capital One series O preferred\nstock to but excluding the redemption date.\n\nIn case of any redemption of only part of the\nshares of Capital One series O preferred stock\nat the time outstanding, the shares to be\nredeemed shall be selected either pro rata, by\nlot or in such other manner as Capital One may\ndetermine to be equitable. Subject to the\nprovisions hereof, the Capital One board of\ndirectors will have full power and authority\nto prescribe the terms\nand conditions upon which shares of Capital\nOne series O preferred stock shall be redeemed\nfrom time to time.\n\nAny redemption of the\nCapital One series O preferred stock is\nsubject to Capital One\u0092s receipt of any\nrequired prior approval from the Federal\nReserve Board and to the satisfaction of any\nconditions set forth in the capital guidelines\nor regulations of the Federal\nReserve Board applicable to redemption of the\nCapital One series O preferred stock. Under\nthe current Federal Reserve Board regulations,\nprior to exercising the option to redeem the\nCapital One series O preferred stock, or\nimmediately\nthereafter, Capital One will be required to\neither replace the Capital One series O\npreferred stock with an equal amount of\ninstruments that meet the Federal Reserve\nBoard\u0092s criteria for common equity Tier 1\ntreatment or additional Tier 1\ntreatment or demonstrate to the satisfaction\nof the Federal Reserve Board that, following\nredemption, Capital One would continue to hold\ncapital commensurate with its risk.\n\nLiquidation Rights\n\nUpon any\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation,\ndissolution or winding-up of Capital One,\nholders of Capital One series O preferred\nstock are entitled to receive out of assets of\nCapital One available for distribution\nto stockholders, after satisfaction of\nliabilities to creditors and subject to the\nrights of holders of any securities ranking\nsenior to Capital One series O preferred\nstock, before any distribution of assets is\nmade to Capital One stockholders or\nany Capital One series O junior securities, a\nliquidating distribution in the amount of the\nliquidation preference of $100,000 per share\nof Capital One series O preferred stock, plus\nany declared and unpaid dividends, without\nregard to any\nundeclared dividends. Holders of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock will not be entitled\nto any other amounts from Capital One after\nthey have received their full liquidating\ndistribution.\n\nIn any such distribution, if the assets of\nCapital One are not sufficient to pay the\nliquidation preferences plus declared and\nunpaid\ndividends in full to all holders of Capital\nOne series O preferred stock and all holders\nof Capital One series O parity securities, if\nany, as to such distribution with the Capital\nOne series O preferred stock\n\n163\n\nthe amounts paid to the holders of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock and to the holders of\nall Capital One series O parity securities, if\nany, will be paid pro rata in accordance with\nthe\nrespective aggregate liquidating distribution\nowed to those holders. If the liquidation\npreference plus declared and unpaid dividends\nhas been paid in full to all holders of\nCapital One series O preferred stock and\nCapital One series O parity\nsecurities, if any, the holders of the Capital\nOne series O junior securities will be\nentitled to receive all remaining assets of\nCapital One according to their respective\nrights and preferences.\n\nIn addition, Capital One will generally be\nable to pay dividends and distributions upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up only\nout of lawfully available assets for such\npayment (after satisfaction of all claims for\nindebtedness and other non-equity claims).\nFurther, the Capital One\nseries O preferred stock may be fully\nsubordinated to interests held by the U.S.\ngovernment in the event that Capital One\nenters into a receivership, insolvency,\nliquidation or similar proceeding, including a\nproceeding under the Orderly Liquidation\nAuthority of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThe merger or consolidation of Capital One\nwith any other entity, including a merger or\nconsolidation in\nwhich the holders of Capital One series O\npreferred stock receive cash, securities or\nproperty for their shares, or the sale, lease\nor exchange of all or substantially all of the\nassets of Capital One for cash, securities or\nother property, shall\nnot constitute a liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding-up of Capital One.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nExcept as provided below or as may be\nexpressly required by law, the holders of\nshares of Capital One series O preferred stock\nwill have no\nvoting power, and no right to vote on any\nmatter at any time, either as a separate\nseries or class or together with any other\nseries or class of shares of Capital One\ncapital stock, and will not be entitled to\ncall a meeting of such holders for any\npurpose, nor will they be entitled to\nparticipate in any meeting of the Capital One\nstockholders.\n\nSo long as any shares of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock remain outstanding,\nthe affirmative vote or consent of the holders\nof at least two-thirds of all of the shares of\nCapital One series O preferred stock at the\ntime outstanding, voting\nseparately as a class, will be required to:\n(1) authorize or increase the authorized\namount of, or issue shares of, any class or\nseries of stock ranking senior to the Capital\nOne series O preferred stock with respect to\npayment of dividends or\nthe distribution of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution or winding-up of Capital One, or\nissue any obligation or security convertible\ninto or evidencing the right to purchase, any\nclass or series of stock\nranking senior to Capital One series O\npreferred stock with respect to payment of\ndividends or the distribution of assets upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding-up of\nCapital One; (2) amend the\nprovisions of Capital One\u0092s charter so as to\nadversely affect the powers, preferences,\nprivileges or rights of Capital One series O\npreferred stock, taken as a whole; provided,\nhowever, that any increase in the amount of\nthe authorized or\nissued shares of Capital One series O\npreferred stock or authorized Capital One\ncommon stock or preferred stock of Capital One\nor the creation and issuance, or an increase\nin the authorized or issued amount, of other\nseries of preferred stock of\nCapital One ranking equally with or junior to\nCapital One series O preferred stock with\nrespect to the payment of dividends (whether\nsuch dividends are cumulative or non-\ncumulative) or the distribution of\nassets upon liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding-up of Capital One will not be deemed\nto adversely affect the powers, preferences,\nprivileges or rights of Capital One series O\npreferred stock; and\n(3) consummate a binding share-exchange or\nreclassification involving the Capital One\nseries O preferred stock, or a merger or\nconsolidation of the Corporation with or into\nanother entity unless (i) the shares of the\nCapital One series O\npreferred stock remain outstanding or are\nconverted into or exchanged for preference\nsecurities of the new surviving entity and\n(ii) the shares of the remaining Capital One\nseries O preferred stock or new preferred\nsecurities have terms that\nare not materially less favorable than the\nCapital One series O preferred stock. The\nforegoing voting provisions will not apply if,\nat or prior to the time when the act with\nrespect to which such vote would otherwise be\nrequired shall be effected,\nall outstanding shares of Capital One series O\npreferred stock shall have been redeemed.\n\n164\n\nIf Capital One fails to pay, or declare and\nset apart for payment, dividends on\noutstanding\nshares of the Capital One series O preferred\nstock for six quarterly dividend periods\n(treating each semi-annual dividend period\nduring the fixed rate period as two quarterly\ndividend periods), whether or not consecutive,\nthen the number of\ndirectors on the Capital One board of\ndirectors will be increased by two at Capital\nOne\u0092s first annual meeting of the stockholders\nheld thereafter, and at such meeting and at\neach subsequent annual meeting until\ncontinuous noncumulative\ndividends for at least one (1) year on all\noutstanding shares of Capital One series O\npreferred stock entitled thereto have been\npaid, or declared and set apart for payment,\nin full, the holders of shares of Capital One\nseries O preferred stock\nwill have the right, voting separately as a\nclass together with holders of any other\nequally ranked series of preferred stock of\nCapital One that have similar voting rights,\nif any, to elect such two additional members\nof Capital One\u0092s board of\ndirectors to hold office for a term of one\nyear. Upon such payment, or such declaration\nand setting apart for payment, in full, the\nterms of the two additional directors so\nelected will terminate, and the number of\ndirectors will be reduced by two,\nand such voting right of the holders of shares\nof preferred stock of Capital One shall cease,\nsubject to increase in the number of directors\nas described above and to revesting of such\nvoting right in the event of each and every\nadditional failure\nin the payment of dividends for six quarterly\ndividend periods (treating each semi-annual\ndividend period during the fixed rate period\nas two quarterly dividend periods), whether or\nnot consecutive, as described above.\n\nWithout the consent of the holders of Capital\nOne series O preferred stock, so long as such\naction does not adversely affect the rights,\npreferences, privileges and voting powers, and\nlimitations and restrictions of the Capital\nOne series O preferred stock, Capital One may\namend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms\nof the Capital One series O preferred stock:\n(i) to cure any\nambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement\nany provision contained in the applicable\ncertificate of designations that may be\ndefective or inconsistent; or (ii) to make any\nprovision with respect to matters or questions\narising with respect to\nthe Capital One series O preferred stock that\nis not inconsistent with the provisions of the\napplicable certificate of designations.\n\nDepositary, Transfer Agent, and Registrar\n\nComputershare Inc. and Computershare Trust\nCompany, N.A., acting jointly, will serve as\nthe\ndepositary, and Computershare Trust Company,\nN.A. will serve as transfer agent and\nregistrar for the Capital One series O\npreferred stock.\n\nNew Capital One Series P Preferred Stock\n\nRank\n\nWith respect to the payment of dividends and\ndistribution of assets upon liquidation,\ndissolution, or\nwinding-up of Capital One, the new Capital One\nseries P preferred stock will rank (i) senior\nto Capital One common stock and to any other\nclass or series of capital stock of Capital\nOne, other than each\nseries of Capital One preferred stock and the\nCapital One series O preferred stock, that, by\nits terms, does not expressly provide that it\nranks pari passu with the new Capital One\nseries P preferred stock and (ii) on a parity\nwith each series\nof Capital One preferred stock, the Capital\nOne series O preferred stock and any other\nclass or series of capital stock of Capital\nOne that, by its terms, expressly provides\nthat it ranks pari passu with the Capital One\nseries P preferred stock.\nCapital One may authorize and issue additional\nshares of Capital One series P junior\nsecurities and Capital One series P parity\nsecurities without the consent of the holders\nof the Capital One series P preferred stock.\n\nThe holders of shares of the new Capital One\nseries P preferred stock will not have any\nrights to convert such shares into shares of\nany other\nclass or series of securities of Capital One.\n\nDividends and Other Distributions\n\nHolders of Capital One series P preferred\nstock will be entitled to receive, only when,\nas and if declared by the Capital One board of\ndirectors or a duly authorized committee\nthereof, out of assets legally available for\nthe\n\n165\n\npayment of dividends under Delaware law, non-\ncumulative cash dividends based on the\nliquidation amount of $100,000 per share of\nthe Capital One series P\npreferred stock at a rate per annum equal to\n(i) 6.125% for each series P dividend period\nfrom, and including, the last dividend payment\ndate in respect of the Discover series D\npreferred stock prior to its conversion to\nCapital One series P\npreferred stock to, but excluding September\n23, 2025 and (ii) the five-year treasury rate\nas of the most recent Capital One series P\nreset dividend determination date plus 5.783%\nduring each series P reset period, from, and\nincluding\nSeptember 23, 2025. If Capital One issues\nadditional shares of the Capital One series P\npreferred stock after the original issue date,\nthen dividends on such shares will accrue from\nthe later of such original issue date of the\nCapital One\nseries P preferred stock or the dividend\npayment date, if any, immediately prior to the\noriginal issue date of such additional shares.\n\nThe \u0093series P reset date\u0094 means September 23,\n2025, and each date falling on the fifth\nanniversary of the preceding series P\nreset date, including September 23, 2025,\nwhich will not be adjusted for business days.\nThe \u0093series P reset dividend determination\ndate\u0094 means, in respect of any series P reset\nperiod, the day falling three business days\nprior to the\nbeginning of the series P reset period. The\n\u0093series P reset period\u0094 means the period from\nand including September 23, 2025, to, but\nexcluding, the next following series P reset\ndate and thereafter each period from and\nincluding each\nreset date to, but excluding, the next\nfollowing series P reset date.\n\nFor any series P reset period commencing on or\nafter\nSeptember 23, 2025, the \u0093five-year treasury\nrate\u0094 means: (i) the average of the yields on\nactively traded U.S. treasury securities\nadjusted to constant maturity, for five-year\nmaturities, for the five business days\nappearing (or,\nif fewer than five business days appear, such\nnumber of business days appearing) under the\ncaption \u0093Treasury Constant Maturities\u0094 in the\nmost recently published H.15 Daily Update as\nof 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) as of any date of\ndetermination; or (ii) if there are no such\npublished yields on actively traded U.S.\ntreasury securities adjusted to constant\nmaturity, for five-year maturities, then the\nrate will be determined by interpolation\nbetween the average of the\nyields on actively traded U.S. treasury\nsecurities adjusted to constant maturity for\ntwo series of actively traded U.S. treasury\nsecurities, (A) one maturing as close as\npossible to, but earlier than, the series P\nreset date following the next\nsucceeding Capital One series P reset dividend\ndetermination date and (B) the other maturing\nas close as possible to, but later than, the\nreset date following the next succeeding\nCapital One series P reset dividend\ndetermination date, in each\ncase for the five business days appearing (or,\nif fewer than five business days appear, such\nnumber of business days appearing) under the\ncaption \u0093Treasury Constant Maturities\u0094 in the\nH.15 Daily Update as of 5:00 p.m. (Eastern\nTime) as of\nany date of determination.\n\nIf Capital One, in its sole discretion,\ndetermines that the five-year treasury rate\ncannot be determined in\nthe manner applicable for such rate (which, as\nof the original issue date of the Capital One\nseries P preferred stock, is pursuant to the\nmethods described above), then Capital One\nmay, in its sole discretion, designate an\nunaffiliated agent or\nadvisor (the \u0093designee\u0094), to determine whether\nthere is an industry-accepted successor rate\nto the then-applicable base rate (which, as of\nthe original issue date of the Capital One\nseries P preferred stock, is the initial base\nrate). If\nthe designee determines that there is such an\nindustry-accepted successor rate, then the\nfive-year treasury rate will be such successor\nrate and, in that case, the designee may\nadjust the spread and may determine and adjust\nthe business day\nconvention, the definition of business day and\nthe reset dividend determination date to be\nused and any other relevant methodology for\ndetermining or otherwise calculating such\nsuccessor rate, including any adjustment\nfactor needed to make such\nsuccessor rate comparable to the then-\napplicable base rate (which, as of the\noriginal issue date of the Capital One series\nP preferred stock, is the initial base rate)\nin each case, in a manner that is consistent\nwith industry-accepted practices for\nthe use of such successor rate. If Capital\nOne, in its sole discretion, does not\ndesignate a designee or if the designee\ndetermines that there is no industry-accepted\nsuccessor rate to then-applicable base rate,\nthen the five-year treasury rate will\nbe the same interest rate determined for the\nprior reset dividend determination date or, if\nthis sentence is applicable with respect to\nthe first series P reset dividend\ndetermination date, 6.125%.\n\nThe five-year treasury rate will be determined\nby the calculation agent on the third business\nday immediately preceding the applicable\nseries\nP reset date.\n\n166\n\nIf declared by the Capital One board of\ndirectors or a duly authorized committee\nthereof, dividends payable on the Capital One\nseries P preferred stock for any series P\ndividend period will be paid semi-annually, in\narrears, on March 23 and September 23 of each\nyear (each, a \u0093series P dividend payment\ndate\u0094). If any series P dividend payment date\nis not a business day, then the payment will\nbe made on the next business day without any\nadjustment to the amount of dividends paid.\nThe \u0093series P dividend period\u0094 refers to the\nperiod from and including a series P dividend\npayment date to but excluding the next series\nP dividend payment date, except that the\ninitial Series P dividend period will commence\non and include the last dividend payment date\nin respect of the Discover series D preferred\nstock prior to its conversion to Capital One\nseries P preferred stock. Dividends will be\npayable to holders of record of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock as they appear on\nCapital One\u0092s stock register on the applicable\nrecord date, which shall be the 15th calendar\nday before the applicable dividend payment\ndate, or such other record date, no earlier\nthan 30 calendar days before the applicable\ndividend payment date, as shall be fixed by\nthe Capital One board of directors or a duly\nauthorized committee thereof. Dividends\npayable on Capital One series P preferred\nstock will be computed on the basis of a\n360-dayyear consisting of twelve 30-daymonths.\nDividends on the Capital One series P\npreferred stock will cease to accrue on the\nredemption date, if any, unless Capital One\ndefaults in the payment of the redemption\nprice of the Capital One series P preferred\nstock called for redemption. Dividends on the\nCapital One series P preferred stock will not\nbe cumulative. If the Capital One board of\ndirectors or a duly authorized committee\nthereof does not declare a dividend on the\nCapital One series P preferred stock in\nrespect of a series P dividend period, then no\ndividend shall be deemed to have accrued for\nsuch series P dividend period, be payable on\nthe applicable dividend payment date or be\ncumulative, and Capital One will have no\nobligation to pay any dividend for that series\nP dividend period, whether or not the Capital\nOne board of directors or a duly authorized\ncommittee thereof declares a dividend for any\nfuture series P dividend period with respect\nto the Capital One series P preferred stock,\nCapital One common stock, or any other class\nor series of preferred stock of Capital One.\nSo long as any share of Capital One series P\npreferred stock remains outstanding, unless,\nin each case, the full dividends for the\npreceding series P dividend period on all\noutstanding shares of Capital One series P\npreferred stock have been declared and paid or\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for the payment\nthereof has been set aside:\n                                              \n      no dividend will be declared or paid    \n      or set aside for payment and no         \n      distribution shall be declared or made  \n      or                                      \n      set aside for payment on any junior     \n      securities (other than (i)\u00a0a dividend   \n      payable solely in junior securities or  \n      (ii)\u00a0any dividend in connection with    \n      the implementation of a stockholders\u0092    \n      rights plan, or the redemption or       \n      repurchase                              \n      of any rights under any such plan);

Subject to the\nforegoing, and not otherwise, dividends\n(payable in cash, stock or otherwise), as may\nbe determined by the Capital One board of\ndirectors or a duly authorized committee\nthereof, may be declared and paid on the\nCapital One common stock and any junior\nsecurities or parity securities from time to\ntime out of any assets legally available for\nsuch payment, and the holders of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock shall not be entitled\nto participate in any such dividend.

Redemption The\nCapital One series P preferred stock is\nperpetual and has no maturity date. The\nCapital One series P preferred stock is not\nsubject to any mandatory redemption, sinking\nfund or other similar provisions. The Capital\nOne series P preferred stock will be\nredeemable at the option of Capital One, in\nwhole or in part, from time to time, during\nthe three-month period prior to, and\nincluding, each reset date, at a redemption\nprice equal to $100,000 per share of Capital\nOne series P preferred stock, plusany declared\nand unpaid dividends, without regard to any\nundeclared dividends, on the shares of Capital\nOne series P preferred stock called for\nredemption to, but excluding, the redemption\ndate. Holders of Capital One series P\npreferred stock will have no right to require\nthe redemption or repurchase of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, within ninety (90) days following\nthe occurrence of a regulatory capital\ntreatment event, Capital One, at its option,\nmay redeem at any time all (but not less than\nall) of the shares of the Capital One series P\npreferred stock at the time outstanding, at a\nredemption price equal to $100,000 per share\nof Capital One series P preferred stock,\nplusany declared and unpaid dividends, without\nregard to any undeclared dividends, on the\nshares of Capital One 168\n\nseries P preferred stock called for redemption\nto, but excluding, the redemption date, upon\nnotice given as described below.\n\nA \u0093regulatory capital treatment event\u0094 means,\nfor purposes of this section, the good faith\ndetermination by Capital One that, as a\nresult of (1) any amendment to, or change\n(including any announced prospective change)\nin, the laws or regulations of the United\nStates or any political subdivision of or in\nthe United States that is enacted or becomes\neffective after the\ninitial issuance of any share of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock; (2) any proposed\nchange in those laws or regulations that is\nannounced or becomes effective after the\ninitial issuance of any share of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock;\nor (3) any official administrative decision or\njudicial decision or administrative action or\nother official pronouncement interpreting or\napplying those laws or regulations that is\nannounced after the initial issuance of any\nshare of Capital\nOne series P preferred stock, there is more\nthan an insubstantial risk that Capital One\nwill not be entitled to treat the full\nliquidation value of the shares of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock then outstanding as\n\u0093additional Tier 1\nCapital\u0094 (or its equivalent) for purposes of\nthe capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal\nReserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the\ncapital adequacy rules or regulations of any\nsuccessor appropriate federal banking agency),\nas then in\neffect and applicable, for as long as any\nshare of Capital One series P preferred stock\nis outstanding. \u0093Appropriate federal banking\nagency\u0094 means the \u0093appropriate federal banking\nagency\u0094 with respect to Capital One as that\nterm\nis defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act or any successor\nprovision.\n\nIf shares of Capital One series P\npreferred stock are to be redeemed, the notice\nof redemption shall be given by first class\nmail to the holders of record of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock to be redeemed,\nmailed not less than five (5) days nor more\nthan sixty\n(60) days prior to the date fixed for\nredemption thereof (provided that, if the\ndepositary shares representing Capital One\nseries P preferred stock are held in book-\nentry form through DTC, Capital One may give\nsuch notice in any manner\npermitted by DTC). Each notice of redemption\nwill include a statement setting forth: (1)\nthe redemption date; (2) the number of shares\nof Capital One series P preferred stock to be\nredeemed and, if less than all the shares held\nby such\nholder are to be redeemed, the number of such\nshares of Capital One series P preferred stock\nto be redeemed from such holder; (3) the\nredemption price; and (4) the place or places\nwhere the certificates evidencing shares of\nCapital One\nseries P preferred stock are to be surrendered\nfor payment of the redemption price. On and\nafter the redemption date, dividends will\ncease to accrue on shares of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock, and such shares of\nCapital One series P preferred\nstock shall no longer be deemed outstanding\nand all rights of the holders of such shares\nwill terminate, except the right to receive\nthe redemption price plus any declared and\nunpaid dividends, without regard to any\nundeclared dividends, on\nsuch shares of Capital One series P preferred\nstock to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n\nIn case of any redemption of only part of the\nshares of Capital One series P preferred stock\nat the time outstanding, the shares to be\nredeemed will be selected either pro rata, by\nlot or in such other manner as Capital One may\ndetermine to be equitable. Subject to the\nprovisions hereof, the\nCapital One board of directors will have full\npower and authority to prescribe the terms and\nconditions upon which shares of Capital One\nseries P preferred stock will be redeemed from\ntime to time.\n\nAny redemption of the Capital One series P\npreferred stock is subject to Capital One\u0092s\nreceipt of any required prior approval from\nthe\nFederal Reserve Board and to the satisfaction\nof any conditions set forth in the capital\nguidelines or regulations of the Federal\nReserve Board applicable to redemption of the\nCapital One series P preferred stock. Under\nthe current Federal\nReserve Board regulations, prior to exercising\nthe option to redeem the Capital One series P\npreferred stock, or immediately thereafter,\nCapital One will be required to either replace\nthe Capital One series P preferred stock with\nan equal amount of\ninstruments that meet the Federal Reserve\nBoard\u0092s criteria for common equity Tier 1\ntreatment or additional Tier 1 treatment or\ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of the Federal\nReserve Board that following redemption,\nCapital One would continue\nto hold capital commensurate with its risk.\n\n169\n\nLiquidation Rights\n\nUpon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,\ndissolution or winding-up of Capital One,\nholders of\nCapital One series P preferred stock are\nentitled to receive out of assets of Capital\nOne available for distribution to\nstockholders, after satisfaction of\nliabilities to creditors and subject to the\nrights of holders of any securities ranking\nsenior to Capital One series P preferred\nstock, before any distribution of assets is\nmade to holders of Capital One common stock or\nany junior securities, a liquidating\ndistribution in the amount of the liquidation\npreference of $100,000 per share\nof Capital One series P preferred stock, plus\nany declared and unpaid dividends, without\nregard to any undeclared dividends. Holders of\nCapital One series P preferred stock will not\nbe entitled to any other amounts from Capital\nOne after they\nhave received their full liquidating\ndistribution.\n\nIn addition, Capital One will generally be\nable to pay dividends and distributions\nupon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up\nonly out of lawfully available assets for such\npayment (after satisfaction of all claims for\nindebtedness and other\nnon-equity claims). Further, the Capital One\nseries P preferred stock may be fully\nsubordinated to interests held by the U.S.\ngovernment in the event that Capital One\nenters into a receivership, insolvency,\nliquidation or similar proceeding, including a\nproceeding under the Orderly Liquidation\nAuthority of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nIn any such\ndistribution, if the assets of Capital One are\nnot sufficient to pay the liquidation\npreferences plus declared and unpaid dividends\nin full to all holders of Capital One series P\npreferred stock and all holders of parity\nsecurities, if any, as to\nsuch distribution with the Capital One series\nP preferred stock the amounts paid to the\nholders of Capital One series P preferred\nstock and to the holders of all parity\nsecurities, if any, will be paid pro rata in\naccordance with the respective\naggregate liquidating distribution owed to\nthose holders.

The foregoing voting\nprovisions will not apply if, at or prior to\nthe time when the act with respect to which\nsuch vote would otherwise be required shall be\neffected, all outstanding shares of\nCapital One series P preferred stock shall\nhave been redeemed.\n\nIf Capital One fails to pay, or declare and\nset apart for payment,\ndividends on outstanding shares of the Capital\nOne series P preferred stock for three semi-\nannual dividend periods, whether or not\nconsecutive, the number of directors on the\nCapital One board of directors will be\nincreased by two at Capital\nOne\u0092s first annual meeting of the stockholders\nheld thereafter, and at such meeting and at\neach subsequent annual meeting until\ncontinuous noncumulative dividends for at\nleast one year on all outstanding shares of\nCapital One series P preferred\nstock have been paid, or declared and set\napart for payment, in full, the holders of\nshares of Capital One series P preferred stock\nwill have the right, voting separately as a\nclass together with holders of any other\nequally ranked series of\npreferred stock of Capital One that have\nsimilar voting rights, if any, to elect such\ntwo additional members of Capital One\u0092s board\nof directors to hold office for a term of one\nyear. Upon such payment, or such declaration\nand setting apart for\npayment, in full, the terms of the two\nadditional directors so elected will\nterminate, and the number of directors will be\nreduced by two, and such voting right of the\nholders of shares of preferred stock of\nCapital One shall cease, subject to\nincrease in the number of directors as\ndescribed above and to revesting of such\nvoting right in the event of each and every\nadditional failure in the payment of dividends\nfor three semi-annual dividend periods,\nwhether or not consecutive, as\ndescribed above.\n\nWithout the consent of the holders of Capital\nOne series P preferred stock, so long as such\naction does not adversely\naffect the rights, preferences, privileges and\nvoting powers, and limitations and\nrestrictions of the Capital One series P\npreferred stock, Capital One may amend, alter,\nsupplement or repeal any terms of the Capital\nOne series P preferred stock:\n(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct\nor supplement any provision contained in the\napplicable certificate of designations that\nmay be defective or inconsistent; or (ii) to\nmake any provision with respect to matters or\nquestions\narising with respect to the Capital One series\nP preferred stock that is not inconsistent\nwith the provisions of the applicable\ncertificate of designations.\n\nDepositary, Transfer Agent, and Registrar\n\nComputershare Inc. and Computershare Trust\nCompany, N.A., acting jointly, will serve as\nthe depositary, and Computershare Trust\nCompany, N.A.\nwill serve as transfer agent and registrar for\nthe new Capital One series P preferred stock.\n\nNew Capital One Depositary Shares\n\nEach new Capital One depositary share\nrepresents a 1/100th interest in one (1) share\nof new Capital One preferred stock, and the\nsame\nproportionate interest in any and all other\nproperty received by the depositary in respect\nof such share of new Capital One preferred\nstock, all as evidenced by depositary\nreceipts.\n\nDividends and Other Distributions\n\nEach dividend payable on a new Capital One\ndepositary share is in an amount equal to\n1/100th of the dividend declared and payable\non the\nrelated share of the new Capital One preferred\nstock.\n\n171\n\nThe depositary distributes any cash dividends\nor other cash distributions received in\nrespect of the new Capital One preferred stock\nto the record holders of new Capital One\ndepositary shares in proportion to the number\nof new Capital One depositary shares held by\nthe holders. If Capital One makes a\ndistribution other than in cash,\nthe depositary will distribute any such\namounts of the securities or property received\nby it to the record holders of new Capital One\ndepositary shares entitled to those\ndistributions, unless it determines, in\nconsultation with Capital One, that the\ndistribution cannot be made proportionally\namong those holders or that it is not feasible\nto make a distribution. In that event, the\ndepositary may, with Capital One\u0092s approval,\nsell the property and distribute the net\nproceeds from the sale to\nthe holders of the new Capital One depositary\nshares.\n\nRecord dates for the payment of dividends and\nother matters relating to the new\nCapital One depositary shares will be the same\nas the corresponding record dates for the new\nCapital One preferred stock.\n\nThe amounts\ndistributed to holders of new Capital One\ndepositary shares will be reduced by any\namounts required to be withheld by the\ndepositary or by Capital One on account of\ntaxes or other governmental charges. The\ndepositary may refuse to make any payment\nor distribution, or any transfer, exchange, or\nwithdrawal of any new Capital One depositary\nshares or the shares of the new Capital One\npreferred stock until such taxes or other\ngovernmental charges are paid.\n\nRedemption\n\nIf Capital One redeems\nthe new Capital One preferred stock\nrepresented by the new Capital One depositary\nshares, then the new Capital One depositary\nshares will be redeemed from the proceeds\nreceived by the depositary resulting from the\nredemption of the new Capital One\npreferred stock held by the depositary. The\nredemption price per new Capital One\ndepositary share is expected to be equal to\n1/100th of the redemption price per share\npayable with respect to the new Capital One\npreferred stock (or $1,000 per\ndepositary share), plus any declared and\nunpaid dividends, without accumulation of any\nundeclared dividends.\n\nWhenever Capital One\nredeems shares of new Capital One preferred\nstock held by the depositary, the depositary\nwill redeem, as of the same redemption date,\nthe number of new Capital One depositary\nshares representing shares of new Capital One\npreferred stock so redeemed.\nIf fewer than all of the outstanding new\nCapital One depositary shares are redeemed,\nthen the depositary will select the new\nCapital One depositary shares to be redeemed\npro rata, by lot or by any other fair and\nequitable manner as Capital One\nmay decide. The depositary will mail notice of\nredemption to record holders of the new\nCapital One depositary shares, in the case of\nnew Capital One depositary shares representing\nshares of new Capital One series O preferred\nstock, not less than ten\n(10) days and not more than sixty (60) days,\nand in the case of new Capital One depositary\nshares representing shares of new Capital One\nseries P preferred stock, not less than five\n(5) days and not more than sixty (60) days,\nprior to the date fixed for redemption of the\nnew Capital One preferred stock and the\nrelated new Capital One depositary shares.\n\nNeither\nthe holders of a series of new Capital One\npreferred stock nor the holders of the related\nnew Capital One depositary shares have the\nright to require the redemption or repurchase\nof such Capital One preferred stock.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nBecause each new\nCapital One depositary share represents a\n1/100th interest in a share of the new Capital\nOne preferred stock, holders of depositary\nreceipts will be entitled to 1/100th of a vote\nper new Capital One depositary share under\nthose limited circumstances\nin which holders of the new Capital One\npreferred stock are entitled to vote.\n\nWhen the depositary receives notice of any\nmeeting at which\nthe holders of the new Capital One preferred\nstock are entitled to vote, the depositary\nwill provide the information contained in the\nnotice to the record holders of the new\nCapital One depositary shares relating to the\nnew Capital One preferred\nstock. Each record holder of the new Capital\nOne depositary shares on the record date,\nwhich will be the same date as the record date\nfor the\n\n172\n\nnew Capital One preferred stock, may instruct\nthe depositary to vote the amount of the new\nCapital One preferred stock represented by the\nholder\u0092s new Capital One depositary shares. To\nthe\nextent possible, the depositary will vote the\namount of the new Capital One preferred stock\nrepresented by new Capital One depositary\nshares in accordance with the instructions it\nreceives. Capital One will agree to take all\nreasonable actions that\nthe depositary determines are necessary to\nenable the depositary to vote as instructed.\nIf the depositary does not receive specific\ninstructions from the holders of any new\nCapital One depositary shares representing the\nnew Capital One preferred\nstock, it will not vote the amount of the new\nCapital One preferred stock represented by\nsuch new Capital One depositary shares.\n\nPreemptive and Conversion Rights\n\nThe holders of the new Capital One depositary\nshares do not have any preemptive or\nconversion rights.\n\nDepositary, Transfer Agent, and Registrar\n\nComputershare Inc. and Computershare Trust\nCompany, N.A., acting jointly, will serve as\nthe depositary, and Computershare Trust\nCompany, N.A.\nwill serve as transfer agent and registrar for\nthe new Capital One depositary shares.\n\n173\n\nCOMPARISON OF THE RIGHTS OF CAPITAL ONE\nSTOCKHOLDERS AND DISCOVER STOCKHOLDERS If the\nmergers are completed, holders of (i) Discover\ncommon stock will receive shares of Capital\nOne common stock in the first merger and will\ncease to hold shares of Discover common stock\nand (ii) Discover preferred stock will receive\nshares of new Capital One preferred stock and\nwill cease to hold shares of Discover\npreferred stock (which will be evidenced by\nCapital One depositary shares representing a\ncorresponding interest in the new Capital One\npreferred stock).

An\naffidavit of the secretary or assistant\nsecretary or of the transfer\nagent of the corporation or entity that is\nrequired to give either notice that such\nnotice has been given shall, in the absence of\nfraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts\nstated therein. For purposes of determining\nthe stockholders entitled to\nreceive either notice, each constituent\ncorporation or the converting, transferring,\ndomesticating or continuing corporation may\nfix, in advance, a record date that shall be\nnot more than 10 days prior to the date the\nnotice is given, provided, that\nif the notice is given on or after the\neffective date of the merger, consolidation,\nconversion, transfer, domestication or\ncontinuance, the record date shall be such\neffective date. If no record date is fixed and\nthe notice is given prior to the\neffective date, the record date shall be the\nclose of business on the day next preceding\nthe day on which the notice is given.\n\n(3)\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section\n(but subject to this paragraph (d)(3)), a\nbeneficial owner may, in such person\u0092s name,\ndemand in writing an appraisal of such\nbeneficial owner\u0092s shares in accordance with\neither paragraph\n(d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable;\nprovided that (i) such beneficial owner\ncontinuously owns such shares through the\neffective date of the merger, consolidation,\nconversion, transfer, domestication or\ncontinuance and otherwise\nsatisfies the requirements applicable to a\nstockholder under the first sentence of\nsubsection (a) of this section and (ii) the\ndemand made by such beneficial owner\nreasonably identifies the holder of record of\nthe shares for which the\ndemand is made, is accompanied by documentary\nevidence of such beneficial owner\u0092s beneficial\nownership of stock and a statement that such\ndocumentary evidence is a true and correct\ncopy of what it purports to be, and provides\nan address at\nwhich such beneficial owner consents to\nreceive notices given by the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity hereunder and to\nbe set forth on the verified list required by\nsubsection (f) of this section.\n\nD-3\n\n(e) Within 120 days after the effective date\nof the merger, consolidation, conversion,\ntransfer,\ndomestication or continuance, the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity, or any person\nwho has complied with subsections (a) and (d)\nof this section and who is otherwise entitled\nto appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal\nproceeding by\nfiling a petition in the Court of Chancery\ndemanding a determination of the value of the\nstock of all such stockholders.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at any time\nwithin 60 days after the effective date of the\nmerger, consolidation,\nconversion, transfer, domestication or\ncontinuance, any person entitled to appraisal\nrights who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party shall have the right to withdraw\nsuch person\u0092s demand for\nappraisal and to accept the terms offered upon\nthe merger, consolidation, conversion,\ntransfer, domestication or continuance. Within\n120 days after the effective date of the\nmerger, consolidation, conversion, transfer,\ndomestication or continuance,\nany person who has complied with the\nrequirements of subsections (a) and (d) of\nthis section, upon request given in writing\n(or by electronic transmission directed to an\ninformation processing system (if any)\nexpressly designated for that\npurpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be\nentitled to receive from the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity a statement\nsetting forth the aggregate number of shares\nnot voted in favor of the merger,\nconsolidation, conversion, transfer,\ndomestication or continuance (or, in the case\nof a merger approved pursuant to \u00a7 251(h) of\nthis title, the aggregate number of shares\n(other than any excluded stock (as defined in\n\u00a7 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the\nsubject of, and\nwere not tendered into, and accepted for\npurchase or exchange in, the offer referred to\nin \u00a7 251(h)(2) of this title)), and, in either\ncase, with respect to which demands for\nappraisal have been received and the aggregate\nnumber of stockholders\nor beneficial owners holding or owning such\nshares (provided that, where a beneficial\nowner makes a demand pursuant to paragraph\n(d)(3) of this section, the record holder of\nsuch shares shall not be considered a separate\nstockholder holding such\nshares for purposes of such aggregate number).\nSuch statement shall be given to the person\nwithin 10 days after such person\u0092s request for\nsuch a statement is received by the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity or within 10\ndays\nafter expiration of the period for delivery of\ndemands for appraisal under subsection (d) of\nthis section, whichever is later.\n\n(f) Upon the filing\nof any such petition by any person other than\nthe surviving, resulting or converted entity,\nservice of a copy thereof shall be made upon\nsuch entity, which shall within 20 days after\nsuch service file in the office of the\nRegister in Chancery\nin which the petition was filed a duly\nverified list containing the names and\naddresses of all persons who have demanded\nappraisal for their shares and with whom\nagreements as to the value of their shares\nhave not been reached by such entity. If the\npetition shall be filed by the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity, the petition\nshall be accompanied by such a duly verified\nlist. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered\nby the Court, shall give notice of the time\nand place fixed for the\nhearing of such petition by registered or\ncertified mail to the surviving, resulting or\nconverted entity and to the persons shown on\nthe list at the addresses therein stated. The\nforms of the notices by mail and by\npublication shall be approved by\nthe Court, and the costs thereof shall be\nborne by the surviving, resulting or converted\nentity.\n\n(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court\nshall\ndetermine the persons who have complied with\nthis section and who have become entitled to\nappraisal rights. The Court may require the\npersons who have demanded an appraisal for\ntheir shares and who hold stock represented by\ncertificates to submit\ntheir certificates of stock to the Register in\nChancery for notation thereon of the pendency\nof the appraisal proceedings; and if any\nperson fails to comply with such direction,\nthe Court may dismiss the proceedings as to\nsuch person. If immediately\nbefore the merger, consolidation, conversion,\ntransfer, domestication or continuance the\nshares of the class or series of stock of the\nconstituent, converting, transferring,\ndomesticating or continuing corporation as to\nwhich appraisal rights are\navailable were listed on a national securities\nexchange, the Court shall dismiss the\nproceedings as to all holders of such shares\nwho are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights\nunless (1) the total number of shares entitled\nto appraisal exceeds\n1% of the outstanding shares of the class or\nseries eligible for appraisal, (2) the value\nof the consideration provided in the merger,\nconsolidation, conversion, transfer,\ndomestication or continuance for such total\nnumber of shares exceeds\n$1 million, or (3) the merger was approved\npursuant to \u00a7 253 or \u00a7 267 of this title.\n\n(h) After the Court determines the persons\nentitled to an appraisal, the appraisal\nproceeding shall be conducted in accordance\nwith the rules of the Court of Chancery,\nincluding any rules specifically governing\nappraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding\nthe Court shall determine the fair\nvalue of the shares exclusive of any\n\nD-4\n\nelement of value arising from the\naccomplishment or expectation of the merger,\nconsolidation, conversion, transfer,\ndomestication or continuance, together with\ninterest, if any, to be paid upon\nthe amount determined to be the fair value. In\ndetermining such fair value, the Court shall\ntake into account all relevant factors. Unless\nthe Court in its discretion determines\notherwise for good cause shown, and except as\nprovided in this\nsubsection, interest from the effective date\nof the merger, consolidation, conversion,\ntransfer, domestication or continuance through\nthe date of payment of the judgment shall be\ncompounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5%\nover the Federal Reserve\ndiscount rate (including any surcharge) as\nestablished from time to time during the\nperiod between the effective date of the\nmerger, consolidation or conversion and the\ndate of payment of the judgment. At any time\nbefore the entry of judgment in the\nproceedings, the surviving, resulting or\nconverted entity may pay to each person\nentitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in\nwhich case interest shall accrue thereafter as\nprovided herein only upon the sum of (1) the\ndifference, if any, between\nthe amount so paid and the fair value of the\nshares as determined by the Court, and (2)\ninterest theretofore accrued, unless paid at\nthat time. Upon application by the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity or by any person\nentitled to\nparticipate in the appraisal proceeding, the\nCourt may, in its discretion, proceed to trial\nupon the appraisal prior to the final\ndetermination of the persons entitled to an\nappraisal. Any person whose name appears on\nthe list filed by the\nsurviving, resulting or converted entity\npursuant to subsection (f) of this section may\nparticipate fully in all proceedings until it\nis finally determined that such person is not\nentitled to appraisal rights under this\nsection.\n\n(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the\nfair value of the shares, together with\ninterest, if any, by the surviving, resulting\nor converted entity to the\npersons entitled thereto. Payment shall be so\nmade to each such person upon such terms and\nconditions as the Court may order. The Court\u0092s\ndecree may be enforced as other decrees in the\nCourt of Chancery may be enforced, whether\nsuch surviving,\nresulting or converted entity be an entity of\nthis State or of any state.\n\n(j) The costs of the proceeding may be\ndetermined by the Court and taxed upon\nthe parties as the Court deems equitable in\nthe circumstances. Upon application of a\nperson whose name appears on the list filed by\nthe surviving, resulting or converted entity\npursuant to subsection (f) of this section who\nparticipated in the\nproceeding and incurred expenses in connection\ntherewith, the Court may order all or a\nportion of such expenses, including, without\nlimitation, reasonable attorney\u0092s fees and the\nfees and expenses of experts, to be charged\npro rata against the\nvalue of all the shares entitled to an\nappraisal not dismissed pursuant to subsection\n(k) of this section or subject to such an\naward pursuant to a reservation of\njurisdiction under subsection (k) of this\nsection.\n\n(k) Subject to the remainder of this\nsubsection, from and after the effective date\nof the merger, consolidation, conversion,\ntransfer, domestication or\ncontinuance, no person who has demanded\nappraisal rights with respect to some or all\nof such person\u0092s shares as provided in\nsubsection (d) of this section shall be\nentitled to vote such shares for any purpose\nor to receive payment of\ndividends or other distributions on such\nshares (except dividends or other\ndistributions payable to stockholders of\nrecord at a date which is prior to the\neffective date of the merger, consolidation,\nconversion, transfer, domestication or\ncontinuance). If a person who has made a\ndemand for an appraisal in accordance with\nthis section shall deliver to the surviving,\nresulting or converted entity a written\nwithdrawal of such person\u0092s demand for an\nappraisal in respect of some or\nall of such person\u0092s shares in accordance with\nsubsection (e) of this section, either within\n60 days after such effective date or\nthereafter with the written approval of the\ncorporation, then the right of such person to\nan appraisal\nof the shares subject to the withdrawal shall\ncease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an\nappraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery\nshall not be dismissed as to any person\nwithout the approval of the Court, and such\napproval may be conditioned upon\nsuch terms as the Court deems just, including\nwithout limitation, a reservation of\njurisdiction for any application to the Court\nmade under subsection (j) of this section;\nprovided, however that this provision shall\nnot affect the right of any\nperson who has not commenced an appraisal\nproceeding or joined that proceeding as a\nnamed party to withdraw such person\u0092s demand\nfor appraisal and to accept the terms offered\nupon the merger, consolidation, conversion,\ntransfer, domestication\nor continuance within 60 days after the\neffective date of the merger, consolidation,\nconversion, transfer, domestication or\ncontinuance, as set forth in subsection (e) of\nthis section. If a petition for an appraisal\nis not filed within the\ntime provided in subsection (e) of this\nsection, the right to appraisal with respect\nto all shares shall cease.\n\nD-5\n\n(l) The shares or other equity interests of\nthe surviving, resulting or converted entity\nto which the shares\nof stock subject to appraisal under this\nsection would have otherwise converted but for\nan appraisal demand made in accordance with\nthis section shall have the status of\nauthorized but not outstanding shares of stock\nor other equity interests of the\nsurviving, resulting or converted entity,\nunless and until the person that has demanded\nappraisal is no longer entitled to appraisal\npursuant to this section.\n\nD-6\n\nPART II\n\nINFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS\n\nItem 20.Indemnification of Directors and\nOfficers\n\nSection 145 of the DGCL provides for the\nindemnification of officers and directors of\ncorporations in terms sufficiently broad\nenough to\npermit the indemnification of the officers and\ndirectors of Capital One from liabilities\n(including reimbursement of expenses incurred)\narising under the Securities Act under certain\ncircumstances. Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL\npermits a\ncorporation to provide in its certificate of\nincorporation that a director of the\ncorporation shall not be personally liable to\nthe corporation or its stockholders for\nmonetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty\nas a director, except for liability\n(i) for any breach of the director\u0092s duty of\nloyalty to the corporation or its\nstockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not\nin good faith or which involve intentional\nmisconduct or a knowing violation of law,\n(iii) in respect of\ncertain unlawful dividend payments or stock\nredemptions or repurchases, or (iv) for any\ntransaction from which the director derived an\nimproper personal benefit.\n\nArticle XI of the Capital One charter, and\nSection 6.6 of the Capital One bylaws,\nprovide, in general, for mandatory\nindemnification of\ndirectors and officers to the fullest extent\npermitted by law, against liability incurred\nby them in proceedings instituted or\nthreatened against them by third parties, or\nby or on behalf of Capital One itself,\nrelating to the manner in which they\nperformed their duties. Under the DGCL, to be\nentitled to mandatory indemnification, a\ndirector or officer must have been successful\nin the defense of a claim or proceeding, or\nthe director or officer must have acted in\ngood faith and in a manner\nthat he or she reasonably believed to be in or\nnot opposed to Capital One\u0092s best interests,\nand with respect to any criminal proceeding,\nmust have had no reasonable cause to believe\nhis or her conduct was unlawful.\n\nAs permitted by the DGCL, Article X of the\nCapital One charter provides that, to the\nfullest extent permitted by the DGCL or\ndecisional law,\nno director shall be personally liable to\nCapital One or to its stockholders for\nmonetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty\nas a director. The effect of this provision in\nthe Capital One charter is to eliminate the\nrights of Capital One and its\nstockholders (through stockholders\u0092 derivative\nsuits on behalf of Capital One) to recover\nmonetary damages against a director for breach\nof fiduciary duty as a director thereof\n(including breaches resulting from negligent\nor grossly negligent\nbehavior) except in the situations described\nin clauses (i)-(iv), inclusive, above. These\nprovisions will not alter the liability of\ndirectors under federal securities laws.\n\nThe Capital One bylaws provide that Capital\nOne shall indemnify any person who was or is a\nparty to or is threatened to be made a party\nto, or\nis involved in any action, suit or proceeding,\nwhether civil, criminal, administrative or\ninvestigative by reason of the fact that he or\nshe is or was a director, officer or employee\nof Capital One or, during such time, is or was\nserving at the\nrequest of Capital One as a director, officer,\nemployee, trustee or agent of any other\ncorporation or of a partnership, joint\nventure, trust or other enterprise (including\nan employee benefit plan), against all\nexpenses, liability and loss\n(including attorneys\u0092 fees, judgments, fines,\nERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts\npaid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably\nincurred or suffered by such person in\nconnection with such action, suit or\nproceeding, to the fullest\nextent authorized by the DGCL, provided that\nCapital One shall indemnify such person in\nconnection with any action, suit or proceeding\n(or part thereof) initiated by such person\nonly if such action, suit or proceeding (or\npart thereof) was\nauthorized by the Capital One board of\ndirectors or brought to enforce rights under\nthe indemnification provisions in Section 6.6\nof the Capital One bylaws.\n\nThe Capital One bylaws also provide that\nCapital One shall advance expenses reasonably\nincurred in connection with any action, suit\nor\nproceeding to directors and officers within\ntwenty (20) days of a request, provided that,\nif required by the DGCL, a director or officer\nfurnishes an undertaking to repay any amounts\nadvanced if it is ultimately determined, by a\nfinal judicial\ndecision from which there is no further right\nto appeal, that the director or officer is not\nentitled to indemnification for such amounts.\n\nII-1\n\nThe Capital One bylaws also provide that\nindemnification provided for in the Capital\nOne bylaws shall not be deemed exclusive of\nany other rights to which the indemnified\nparty may be entitled; that any right of\nindemnification or protection provided under\nthe Capital One bylaws shall not be adversely\naffected by any amendment, repeal, or\nmodification of the Capital One bylaws; and\nthat Capital One may purchase and maintain\ninsurance to protect itself and any such\nperson against any such expenses, liability\nand loss, whether or not Capital One would\nhave the power to indemnify such person\nagainst such expenses, liability or loss under\nthe DGCL. In addition to the above, Capital\nOne may enter into one or more agreements with\nany person to provide for indemnification\ngreater or different than that which is\nprovided for in the Capital One charter or the\nCapital One bylaws. For the undertaking with\nrespect to indemnification under the\nSecurities Act, see Item 22 below.
