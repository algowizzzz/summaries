We also earn non-\ninterest income which primarily consists of\ninterchange income, net of reward expenses,\nservice charges and other customer-related\nfees. Our expenses primarily consist of the\nprovision for credit losses, operating\nexpenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.\n\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into three major\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customers served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a business segment are\nincluded in the Other category, such as the\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio and asset/liability positions\nperformed by our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group and any residual tax expense or\nbenefit beyond what is assessed to our\nbusiness segments in order to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate. The Other\ncategory also includes unallocated corporate\nexpenses that do not directly support the\noperations of the business segments or for\nwhich the business segments are not considered\nfinancially accountable in evaluating their\nperformance, such as certain restructuring\ncharges, as well as residual tax expense or\nbenefit to arrive at the consolidated\neffective tax rate that is not assessed to our\nprimary business segments.\n\n\u2022 Credit Card: Consists of our domestic\nconsumer and small business card lending, and\ninternational card businesses in the United\nKingdom and Canada.\n\n\u2022 Consumer Banking: Consists of our deposit\ngathering and lending activities for consumers\nand small businesses, and national auto\nlending.\n\n\u2022 Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending,\ndeposit gathering, capital markets and\ntreasury management services to commercial\nreal estate and commercial and industrial\ncustomers. Our customers typically include\ncompanies with annual revenues between $20\nmillion and $2 billion.\n\nCustomer usage and payment patterns, estimates\nof future expected credit losses, levels of\nmarketing expense and operating efficiency all\naffect our profitability. In our Credit Card\nbusiness, we generally experience fluctuations\nin purchase volume and the level of\noutstanding loan receivables from seasonal\nvariances in consumer spending and payment\npatterns which, for example, have historically\nbeen the highest around the winter holiday\nseason. Net charge-off rates for our credit\ncard loan portfolio also have historically\nexhibited seasonal patterns as well and\ngenerally tend to be the highest in the first\nquarter of the year.\n\nFor additional information on our business\nsegments, including the financial performance\nof each business, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7.\nMD&A\u2014Executive Summary,\u201d \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7.\nMD&A\u2014Business Segment Financial Performance\u201d\nand \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

In\ngeneral, customers are attracted to credit\ncard issuers largely on the basis of price,\ncredit limit, reward programs, customer\nexperience and other product features.\n\nOur Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses compete with national, state and\ndirect banks for deposits, commercial and auto\nloans, as well as with savings and loan\nassociations and credit unions for loans and\ndeposits. Our competitors also include\nautomotive finance companies, commercial\nbanking companies and other financial services\nproviders that provide loans, deposits, and\nother similar services and products. In\naddition, we compete against non-depository\ninstitutions that are able to offer these\nproducts and services.\n\nWe also consider new and emerging companies in\ndigital and mobile payments and other\nfinancial technology providers among our\ncompetitors. We compete with many forms of\npayment mechanisms, systems and products,\noffered by both bank and non-bank providers.\n\nOur businesses generally compete on the basis\nof the quality and range of their products and\nservices, transaction execution, innovation\nand price. Competition varies based on the\ntypes of clients, customers, industries and\ngeographies served. Our ability to compete\ndepends, in part, on our ability to attract\nand retain our associates and on our\nreputation as well as our ability to keep pace\nwith innovation, in particular in the\ndevelopment of new technology platforms. There\ncan be no assurance, however, that our ability\nto market products and services successfully\nor to obtain adequate returns on our products\nand services will not be impacted by the\nnature of the competition that now exists or\nmay later develop, or by the broader economic\nenvironment.

In\naddition to banking laws and regulations, we\nare subject to various other laws and\nregulations, all of which directly or\nindirectly affect our operations, management\nand ability to make distributions to\nstockholders. We and our subsidiaries are also\nsubject to supervision and examination by\nmultiple regulators. In addition to laws and\nregulations, state and federal bank regulatory\nagencies may issue policy statements,\ninterpretive letters and similar written\nguidance applicable to us and our\nsubsidiaries. Any change in the statutes,\nregulations or regulatory policies applicable\nto us, including changes in their\ninterpretation or implementation, could have a\nmaterial effect on our business or\norganization.\n\nBoth the scope of the laws and regulations and\nthe intensity of the supervision to which we\nare subject have increased, initially in\nresponse to the 2007-2008 financial crisis,\nand more recently in light of other factors\nsuch as technological, political and market\nchanges, as well as the 2023 regional bank\nfailures. Regulatory enforcement and fines\nhave also increased across the banking and\nfinancial services sector.\n\nThe descriptions below summarize certain\nsignificant federal and state laws, as well as\ninternational laws, to which we are subject.\nThe descriptions are qualified in their\nentirety by reference to the particular\nstatutory or regulatory provisions summarized.\nThey do not summarize all possible or proposed\nchanges in current laws or regulations and are\nnot intended to be a substitute for the\nrelated statutes or regulatory provisions.\n                                              \n  Prudential Regulation of Banking            \n                                              \nCapital One Financial Corporation is a bank\nholding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial\nholding company (\u201cFHC\u201d) under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956, as amended (\u201cBHC Act\u201d),\nand is subject to the requirements of the BHC\nAct, including\n                                              \n  7    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\napproval requirements for investments in or\nacquisitions of banking organizations, capital\nadequacy standards and limitations on non-\nbanking activities. As a BHC and FHC, we are\nsubject to supervision, examination and\nregulation by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d).\nPermissible activities for a BHC include those\nactivities that are so closely related to\nbanking as to be a proper incident thereto. In\naddition, an FHC is permitted to engage in\nactivities considered to be financial in\nnature (including, for example, securities\nunderwriting and dealing and merchant banking\nactivities), incidental to financial\nactivities or, if the Federal Reserve\ndetermines that they pose no risk to the\nsafety or soundness of depository institutions\nor the financial system in general, activities\ncomplementary to financial activities.\n\nTo become and remain eligible for FHC status,\na BHC and its subsidiary depository\ninstitutions must meet certain criteria,\nincluding capital, management and Community\nReinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requirements. Failure\nto meet such criteria could result, depending\non which requirements were not met, in\nrestrictions on new financial activities or\nacquisitions or being required to discontinue\nexisting activities that are not generally\npermissible for BHCs.\n\nThe Bank is a national association chartered\nunder the National Bank Act, the deposits of\nwhich are insured by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) up to\napplicable limits.

Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note\n11\u2014Regulatory and Capital Adequacy.\u201d\n\nBasel III and U.S. Capital Rules\n\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the\nregulatory capital requirements established by\nthe Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively\n(\u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d). The Basel III\nCapital Rules implement certain capital\nrequirements published by the Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel Committee\u201d),\nalong with certain provisions of the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and\nother capital provisions.\n\nAs a BHC with total consolidated assets of at\nleast $250 billion but less than $700 billion\nand not exceeding any of the applicable risk-\nbased thresholds, the Company is a Category\nIII institution under the Basel III Capital\nRules.\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III\ninstitution, is a Category III bank. Moreover,\nthe Bank, as an insured depository\ninstitution, is subject to prompt corrective\naction (\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations, as\ndescribed below.\n\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer requirement and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement,\neach as described below. Our capital and\nleverage ratios are calculated based on the\nBasel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of\naccumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our regulatory capital as\npermitted for a Category III institution. See\n\u201cBasel III Finalization Proposal\u201d below for\ninformation on the recognition of AOCI in\nregulatory capital under the proposed changes\nto the Basel III Capital Rules.\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (\u201cG-SIBs\u201d)\nthat are based in the U.S. are subject to an\nadditional CET1 capital requirement known as\nthe \u201cG-SIB Surcharge.\u201d We are not a G-SIB\nbased on the most recent available data and\nthus we are not subject to a G-SIB Surcharge.\n                                              \n  8    Capital One Financial Corporation      \n       (COF)                                  \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nStress Capital Buffer Rule\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules require banking\ninstitutions to maintain a capital\nconservation buffer, composed of CET1 capital,\nabove the regulatory minimum ratios. Under the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s final rule to implement the\nstress capital buffer requirement, (\u201cStress\nCapital Buffer Rule\u201d), the Company\u2019s\n\u201cstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer\u201d includes its stress capital buffer\nrequirement (as described below), any G-SIB\nSurcharge (which is not applicable to us) and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%). Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Reserve, OCC\nand the FDIC (collectively, \u201cFederal Banking\nAgencies\u201d) set an earlier effective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is recalibrated every year based\non the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults, as discussed below. In particular,\nthe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement equals, subject to a floor of\n2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between\nthe Company\u2019s starting CET1 capital ratio and\nits lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under\nthe severely adverse scenario of the Federal\nReserve\u2019s supervisory stress test plus (ii)\nthe ratio of the Company\u2019s projected four\nquarters of common stock dividends (for the\nfourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the Company\u2019s\nprojected CET1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2023 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is\n4.8%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 9.3%,\n10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2023 through September 30,\n2024.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC\u2019s capital\nregulations, which are only applicable to the\nBank, the capital conservation buffer for the\nBank continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, the Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%,\nrespectively. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7.\nMD&A\u2014Capital Management\u201d and \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u2014Note 11\u2014Regulatory and Capital Adequacy\u201d\nfor additional information.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain\nits capital ratios above the minimum capital\nrequirements plus the applicable capital\nconservation buffer requirements, it will face\nincreasingly strict automatic limitations on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments to certain executive officers.\n\nSee also \u201cCapital Planning and Stress Testing\u201d\nbelow for more information about the stress\ncapital buffer determination process.\n\nCECL Transition Rule\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final\nrule (\u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d) that provides\nbanking institutions an optional five-year\ntransition period to phase in the impact of\nthe current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d)\nstandard on their regulatory capital (\u201cCECL\nTransition Election\u201d). We adopted the CECL\nstandard (for accounting purposes) as of\nJanuary 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition\nElection (for regulatory capital purposes) in\nthe first quarter of 2020.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

The Market Risk Rule\ngenerally applies to institutions with\naggregate trading assets and liabilities equal\nto 10% or more of total assets or $1 billion\nor more. As of December 31, 2023, the Company\nand the Bank are subject to the Market Risk\nRule. See \u201cPart II\u4e00Item 7. MD&A\u4e00Market Risk\nProfile\u201d for additional information.\n\nBasel III Finalization Proposal\n\nThe Federal Banking Agencies have released a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking (\u201cBasel III\nFinalization Proposal\u201d) to revise the Basel\nIII Capital Rules applicable to banking\norganizations with total assets of $100\nbillion or more and their subsidiary\ndepository institutions, including the Company\nand the Bank.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would\nintroduce a new framework for calculating\nrisk-weighted assets (\u201cExpanded Risk-Based\nApproach\u201d). An institution subject to the\nproposal would be required to calculate its\nrisk-weighted assets under both the Expanded\nRisk-Based Approach and the existing Basel III\nstandardized approach and, for each risk-based\ncapital ratio, would be bound by the\ncalculation that produces the lower ratio. All\ncapital buffer requirements, including the\nstress capital buffer requirement, would apply\nregardless of whether the Expanded Risk-Based\nApproach or the existing Basel III\nstandardized approach produces the lower\nratio. The proposal would also replace the\nexisting approach for calculating market risk\nwith a new approach based on both internal\nmodels and standardized methodologies.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal would also\nmake certain changes to the calculation of\nregulatory capital for Category III and IV\ninstitutions. Under the proposal, these\ninstitutions would be required to begin\nrecognizing certain elements of AOCI in CET1\ncapital, including unrealized gains and losses\non available for sale securities. The proposal\nwould also generally reduce the threshold\nabove which these institutions must deduct\ncertain assets from their CET1 capital,\nincluding certain deferred tax assets,\nmortgage servicing assets and investments in\nunconsolidated financial institutions.\n\nThe Basel III Finalization Proposal includes a\nproposed effective date of July 1, 2025,\nsubject to a three-year transition period\nending July 1, 2028, over which risk-weighted\nassets calculated under the Expanded Risk-\nBased Approach and the recognition of AOCI in\nCET1 capital would be phased in.\n\nFDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act of 1991 (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) requires\nthe Federal Banking Agencies to take PCA for\nbanks that do not meet minimum capital\nrequirements. FDICIA establishes five capital\nratio levels: well capitalized; adequately\ncapitalized; undercapitalized; significantly\nundercapitalized; and critically\nundercapitalized. The three undercapitalized\ncategories are based upon the amount by which\na bank falls below the ratios applicable to an\nadequately capitalized institution. The\ncapital categories relate to FDICIA\u2019s PCA\nprovisions, and such capital categories may\nnot constitute an accurate representation of\nthe Bank\u2019s overall financial condition or\nprospects.\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules updated the PCA\nframework to reflect new, higher regulatory\ncapital minimums. For an insured depository\ninstitution to be well capitalized, it must\nmaintain a total risk-based capital ratio of\n10% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or\nmore; a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more;\nand a leverage ratio of 5% or more. An\nadequately capitalized depository institution\nmust maintain a total risk-based capital ratio\nof 8% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or\nmore; a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more; a\nleverage ratio of 4% or more; and, for\nCategory III and certain other institutions, a\nsupplementary leverage ratio of 3% or more.\nThe PCA provisions also authorize the Federal\nBanking Agencies to reclassify a bank\u2019s\ncapital category or take other action against\nbanks that are determined to be in an unsafe\nor unsound condition or to have engaged in\nunsafe or unsound banking practices.\n                                              \n  10    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve\u2019s capital planning\nrules and related supervisory process\n(commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review or \u201cCCAR\u201d requirements), a\n\u201ccovered BHC,\u201d such as the Company, must\nsubmit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve\non an annual basis that contains a description\nof all planned capital actions, including\ndividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-\nquarter planning horizon beginning with the\nfirst quarter of the calendar year the capital\nplan is submitted.\n\nPursuant to the capital planning rules, the\nCompany must file its capital plan with the\nFederal Reserve by April 5 of each year\n(unless the Federal Reserve designates a later\ndate), using data as of the end of the prior\ncalendar year. The Federal Reserve will\nrelease the results of the supervisory stress\ntest and notify the Company of its preliminary\nstress capital buffer requirement by June 30\nof that year, and final stress capital buffer\nrequirement by August 31 of that year. The\nCompany\u2019s final stress capital buffer\nrequirement will be effective from October 1\nof the year in which the capital plan is\nsubmitted through September 30 of the\nfollowing year.\n\nThe Company may make capital distributions in\nexcess of those included in its capital plan\nwithout the prior approval of the Federal\nReserve so long as the Company is otherwise in\ncompliance with the capital rule\u2019s automatic\nlimitations on capital distributions.\n\nWe are also subject to supervisory and\ncompany-run stress testing requirements (also\nknown as the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests\n(\u201cDFAST\u201d), which are a complementary exercise\nto CCAR. DFAST is a forward-looking exercise\nconducted by the Federal Reserve and each\ncovered company to help assess whether a\ncompany has sufficient capital to absorb\nlosses and continue operations during adverse\neconomic conditions. In particular, the\nFederal Reserve is required to conduct annual\nstress tests on certain covered companies,\nincluding us, to ensure that the covered\ncompanies have sufficient capital to absorb\nlosses and continue operations during adverse\neconomic conditions, as well as to determine\nthe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement as described above. As a Category\nIII institution, we are also required to\nconduct our own stress tests and publish the\nresults of such tests on our website or other\npublic forum. The Company must disclose the\nresults of its company-run stress test on a\nbiennial basis. Under the OCC\u2019s stress test\nrule, a bank with at least $250 billion in\nassets, including the Bank, must conduct its\nown company-run stress tests. The Bank must\nalso disclose the results of its stress test\non a biennial basis.\n                                              \n  Funding and Dividends from Subsidiaries     \n                                              \nDividends from the Company\u2019s direct and\nindirect subsidiaries represent a major source\nof the funds we use to pay dividends on our\ncapital stock, make payments on our corporate\ndebt securities and meet our other\nobligations. There are various federal law\nlimitations on the extent to which the Bank\ncan finance or otherwise supply funds to the\nCompany through dividends and loans. These\nlimitations include minimum regulatory capital\nand capital buffer requirements, federal\nbanking law requirements concerning the\npayment of dividends out of net profits or\nsurplus, provisions of Sections 23A and 23B of\nthe Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W\ngoverning transactions between an insured\ndepository institution and its affiliates, as\nwell as general federal regulatory oversight\nto prevent unsafe or unsound practices. In\ngeneral, federal and applicable state banking\nlaws prohibit insured depository institutions,\nsuch as the Bank, from making dividend\ndistributions without first obtaining\nregulatory approval if such distributions are\nnot paid out of available earnings or would\ncause the institution to fail to meet\napplicable capital adequacy standards.\n                                              \n   Liquidity Regulation                       \n                                              \nThe Company and the Bank are subject to\nminimum liquidity standards as adopted by the\nFederal Reserve and OCC, respectively. For a\nfurther discussion of the minimum liquidity\nstandards, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7. MD&A\u2014Liquidity\nRisk Profile.\u201d\n\nThe Basel Committee has published a liquidity\nframework that includes two standards for\nliquidity risk supervision. One standard, the\nliquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), seeks to\npromote short-term resilience by requiring\norganizations to hold sufficient high-quality\nliquid assets (\u201cHQLAs\u201d) to survive a stress\nscenario lasting for 30 days. The other\nstandard, the net stable funding ratio\n(\u201cNSFR\u201d), seeks to promote longer-term\nresilience by requiring sufficient stable\nfunding over a one-year period based on the\nliquidity characteristics of the\norganization\u2019s assets and activities.\n\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the\nLCR standard as implemented by the Federal\nReserve and OCC, respectively (\u201cLCR Rule\u201d).\nThe LCR Rule requires each of the Company and\nthe Bank to hold an amount of eligible HQLA\nthat equals or exceeds 100% of its respective\nprojected adjusted net cash outflows over a\n30-day period, each as calculated in\naccordance with\n                                              \n  11    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nthe LCR Rule. The LCR Rule requires each of\nthe Company and the Bank to calculate its\nrespective LCR daily. In addition, the Company\nis required to make quarterly public\ndisclosures of its LCR and certain related\nquantitative liquidity metrics, along with a\nqualitative discussion of its LCR.\n\nAs a Category III institution with less than\n$75 billion in weighted average short-term\nwholesale funding, the Company\u2019s and the\nBank\u2019s total net cash outflows are multiplied\nby an outflow adjustment percentage of 85%.\nAlthough the Bank may hold more HQLA than it\nneeds to meet its LCR requirements, the LCR\nRule restricts the amount of such excess HQLA\nheld at the Bank (referred to as \u201cTrapped\nLiquidity\u201d) that can be included in the\nCompany\u2019s HQLA amount. Because we typically\nmanage the Bank\u2019s LCR to levels well above\n100%, the result is additional Trapped\nLiquidity as the Bank\u2019s net cash outflows are\nreduced by the outflow adjustment percentage\nof 85%.\n\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the\nNSFR standard as implemented by the Federal\nReserve and OCC, respectively (\u201cNSFR Rule\u201d).\nThe NSFR Rule requires each of the Company and\nthe Bank to maintain an amount of available\nstable funding, which is a weighted measure of\na company\u2019s funding sources over a one-year\ntime horizon, calculated by applying\nstandardized weightings to equity and\nliabilities based on their expected stability,\nthat is no less than a specified percentage of\nits required stable funding, which is\ncalculated by applying standardized weightings\nto assets, derivatives exposures and certain\nother items based on their liquidity\ncharacteristics. As a Category III\ninstitution, the Company and the Bank are each\nrequired to maintain available stable funding\nin an amount at least equal to 85% of its\nrequired stable funding. The Company is\nrequired to make public disclosures of its\nNSFR every second and fourth quarter,\nincluding certain quantitative metrics and a\nqualitative discussion of its NSFR drivers and\nresults.\n\nIn addition to the LCR and NSFR requirements\ndiscussed above, the Company is required to\nmeet liquidity risk management standards,\nconduct internal liquidity stress tests and\nmaintain a 30-day buffer of highly liquid\nassets, in each case, consistent with Federal\nReserve regulations.\n                                              \n  Deposit Funding and Brokered Deposits       \n                                              \nUnder FDICIA, only well capitalized and\nadequately capitalized institutions may accept\n\u201cbrokered deposits,\u201d as defined by FDIC\nregulations. Adequately capitalized\ninstitutions, however, must obtain a waiver\nfrom the FDIC before accepting brokered\ndeposits, and such institutions may not pay\nrates that significantly exceed the rates paid\non deposits of similar maturity obtained from\nthe institution\u2019s normal market area or, for\ndeposits obtained from outside the\ninstitution\u2019s normal market area, the national\nrate on deposits of comparable maturity. See\n\u201cPart   II\u4e00Item   7.   MD&A\u4e00Liquidity   Risk\nProfile\u201d\nfor additional information.\n\nThe FDIC is authorized to terminate a bank\u2019s\ndeposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC\nthat the bank\u2019s financial condition is unsafe\nor unsound or that the institution has engaged\nin unsafe or unsound practices or has violated\nany applicable rule, regulation, order or\ncondition enacted or imposed by the bank\u2019s\nregulatory agency.\n\nResolution and Recovery Planning Requirements\nand Related Authorities\n\nResolution and Recovery Planning\n\nThe Company is required to implement\nresolution planning for orderly resolution in\nthe event it faces material financial distress\nor failure. The FDIC issued, and has proposed\nto significantly amend, similar rules\nregarding resolution planning applicable to\nthe Bank. If adopted as proposed, the\namendments proposed by the FDIC would require\nthe Bank to file its resolution plan more\nfrequently, increase the content requirements\nfor plan submissions and introduce a new\ncredibility standard for the FDIC\u2019s evaluation\nof the Bank\u2019s resolution plan. In addition,\nthe OCC has issued rules requiring banks with\nassets of $250 billion or more to develop\nrecovery plans detailing the actions they\nwould take to remain a going concern when they\nexperience considerable financial or\noperational stress, but have not deteriorated\nto the point that resolution is imminent.\n                                              \n  Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company    \n  Proposal                                    \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies have proposed a\nrule that would require banking organizations\nwith $100 billion or more in total assets,\nincluding the Company, to comply with certain\nlong-term debt requirements and so-called\n\u201cclean holding company\u201d requirements that are\ndesigned to improve the resolvability of\ncovered organizations (\u201cLTD Proposal\u201d). If\nadopted as proposed, the LTD Proposal would\nrequire the Company and the Bank to each\nmaintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-\nterm debt amount of no less than the greatest\nof (i) 6% of total risk-weighted assets, (ii)\n2.5% of total leverage exposure and (iii) 3.5%\nof average total consolidated assets. To\nqualify as eligible long-term debt, a debt\ninstrument would be required to meet the\n                                              \n  12    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nrequirements currently applicable under the\nrules that apply to U.S. G-SIBs, as well as\ncertain additional requirements. Additionally,\nthe clean holding company requirements\nincluded in the LTD Proposal would limit or\nprohibit the Company from entering into\ncertain transactions that could impede its\norderly resolution.\n\nSource of Strength\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation Y requires a\nBHC to serve as a source of financial and\nmanagerial strength to its subsidiary banks\n(this is known as the \u201csource of strength\ndoctrine\u201d). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires a BHC to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength to its subsidiary banks and\nfurther requires the Federal Banking Agencies\nto jointly adopt rules implementing this\nrequirement. The Federal Banking Agencies have\nyet to propose rules as required by the Dodd-\nFrank Act, but they may do so in the future.\nFDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority\nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides the FDIC with\nliquidation authority that may be used to\nliquidate non-bank financial companies and\nBHCs if the Treasury Secretary, in\nconsultation with the President and based on\nthe recommendation of the Federal Reserve and\nother appropriate Federal Banking Agencies,\ndetermines that doing so is necessary, among\nother criteria, to mitigate serious adverse\neffects on U.S. financial stability. Upon such\na determination, the FDIC would be appointed\nreceiver and must liquidate the company in a\nway that mitigates significant risks to\nfinancial stability and minimizes moral\nhazard. The costs of a liquidation of the\ncompany would be borne by shareholders and\nunsecured creditors and then, if necessary, by\nrisk-based assessments on large financial\ncompanies. The FDIC has issued rules\nimplementing certain provisions of its\nliquidation authority.\nFDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments\nThe Bank, as an insured depository\ninstitution, is a member of the Deposit\nInsurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) maintained by the FDIC.\nThrough the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits\nof insured depository institutions up to\nprescribed limits for each depositor. The FDIC\nsets a Designated Reserve Ratio (\u201cDRR\u201d) for\nthe DIF. To maintain the DIF, member\ninstitutions may be assessed an insurance\npremium, and the FDIC may take action to\nincrease insurance premiums if the DRR falls\nbelow its required level.\n\nThe FDIC, as required under the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Act, established a plan in\nSeptember 2020, to restore the DIF reserve\nratio to meet or exceed 1.35 percent within\neight years. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC\nfinalized a rule that increases the initial\nbase deposit insurance assessment rate\nschedules by 2 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d) for all\ninsured depository institutions to improve the\nlikelihood that the DIF reserve ratio reaches\n1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of\nSeptember 30, 2028. The rule took effect on\nJanuary 1, 2023 and this increase was\nreflected in the Bank\u2019s first quarterly\nassessment in 2023.\n\nOn November 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a\nrule to implement a special assessment to\nrecover the loss to the DIF arising from the\nprotection of uninsured depositors in\nconnection with the systemic risk\ndetermination announced on March 12, 2023,\nfollowing the closures of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank. The FDIC will collect the\nspecial assessment at an annual rate of\napproximately 13.4 bps over eight quarterly\nassessment periods, beginning with the first\nquarter of 2024 with the first payment due on\nJune 28, 2024.

Control\nunder the BHC Act exists if, among other\nthings, a person or company acquires more than\n25% of any class of our voting stock or\notherwise has a controlling influence over us.\nA rebuttable presumption of control arises\nunder the CIBC Act for a publicly traded BHC\nsuch as ourselves if a person or company\nacquires more than 10% of any class of our\nvoting stock.\n\nAdditionally, the Bank is a \u201cbank\u201d within the\nmeaning of Chapter 7 of Title 6.2 of the Code\nof Virginia governing the acquisition of\ninterests in Virginia financial institutions\n(\u201cVirginia Financial Institution Holding\nCompany Act\u201d).

Borrowers may also\nhave a private right of action for certain\nviolations. Federal bankruptcy and state\ndebtor relief and collection laws may also\naffect the ability of a bank, including the\nBank, to collect outstanding balances owed by\nborrowers.\n\nDebit Card Interchange Fees and Transaction\nProcessing\n\nThe Bank is subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nRegulation II, which limits the amount of\ninterchange fees that can be charged per debit\ncard transaction for debit card issuers with\nover $10 billion in assets and places certain\nprohibitions on payment routing restrictions\nand network exclusivity.

These\nareas have seen a considerable increase in\nlegislative and regulatory activity over the\npast several years. At the federal level, we\nare subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\n(\u201cGLBA\u201d), among other laws and regulations.\nMoreover, the U.S. Congress is currently\nconsidering various proposals for more\ncomprehensive privacy, data protection and\ndata security legislation, to which we may be\nsubject if passed. For example, in 2022,\nCongress and the federal agencies sought to\ninstitute mandatory reporting of cyber\nincidents that materially disrupt or degrade\noperations and systems or might otherwise\nimpact U.S. critical infrastructure or\nnational security. This resulted in enactment\nof the Cyber Incident\n                                              \n  14    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nReporting for Critical Infrastructure Act\n(\u201cCIRCIA\u201d), which, once rulemaking is\ncomplete, will require, among other things,\ncertain companies, including Capital One, to\nreport significant cyber incidents to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security\u2019s\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security\nAgency (\u201cCISA\u201d) within 72 hours from the time\nthe company reasonably believes the incident\noccurred.\n\nAt the state level, we are subject to a number\nof laws and regulations, such as the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act and its\nimplementing regulations (as amended by the\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act, collectively,\nthe \u201cCPRA\u201d), which creates obligations on\ncovered companies to, among other things,\nshare certain information they have collected\nabout California residents with those\nindividuals, subject to certain exceptions.\nMany other states also have enacted or are in\nthe process of enacting state-level privacy,\ndata protection and/or data security laws and\nregulations, with which we may be required to\ncomply. In addition, state laws require\nbusinesses to provide notice under certain\ncircumstances to consumers whose personal\ninformation has been disclosed as a result of\na data breach. Significant uncertainty exists\nas federal and state privacy, data protection\nand data security laws may be interpreted and\napplied differently and may create\ninconsistent or conflicting requirements.\n\nFor more information on privacy, data\nprotection and data security laws and\nregulations at the international level, please\nsee \u201cRegulation by Authorities Outside the\nUnited States.\u201d\n\nFor further discussion of privacy, data\nprotection and data security, and related\nrisks for our business, see \u201cItem 1A.

For example, the AML\nAct requires FinCEN to issue National Anti-\nMoney Laundering and Countering the Financing\nof Terrorism Priorities (the \u201cNational\nPriorities\u201d), which the agency did in June\n2021, and to conduct studies and issue\nregulations that may alter some of the due\ndiligence, record-keeping and reporting\nrequirements that the BSA and Patriot Act\nimpose on banks. FinCEN has yet to issue a\nfinal rule that establishes the compliance\nobligations of financial institutions with\nrespect to the National Priorities, and\nseveral other mandatory rulemakings under the\nAML Act remain outstanding. The AML Act also\npromotes increased information-sharing and use\nof technology and increases penalties for\nviolations of the BSA and includes\nwhistleblower incentives, both of which could\nincrease the prospect of regulatory\nenforcement.\n\nWe are also required to comply with sanctions\nlaws and regulations administered and imposed\nby the United States government, including the\nU.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign\nAssets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the Department of\nState, as well as comparable sanctions\nprograms imposed by foreign governments and\nmultilateral bodies.

The Bank is registered with the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d)\nas a swap dealer. Registration as a swap\ndealer subjects the Bank to additional\nregulatory requirements with respect to its\nswaps and other derivatives activities.

These\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to,\namong other things, net capital rules designed\nto measure the general financial condition and\nliquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these\nrules, broker-dealers are required to maintain\nthe minimum net capital deemed necessary to\nmeet their continuing commitments to customers\nand others, and to keep a substantial portion\nof their assets in relatively liquid form.\nThese rules also limit the ability of a\nbroker-dealer to transfer capital to its\nparent companies and other affiliates. Broker-\ndealers are also subject to regulations\ncovering their business operations, including\nsales and trading practices, public and\nprivate offerings, publication of research\nreports, use and safekeeping of client funds\nand securities, capital structure, record-\nkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers\nand employees.\n                                              \n  Climate-related Developments                \n                                              \nClimate change and the risks it may pose to\nfinancial institutions is an area of increased\nfocus by the federal and state legislative\nbodies and regulators, including the Federal\nBanking Agencies.

These risk\nfactors do not identify all risks that we\nface; our operations could also be affected by\nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not\npresently known to us or that we currently do\nnot consider to present significant risks to\nour operations. In addition, the global\neconomic and political climate may amplify\nmany of these risks.\n                                              \n  Summary of Risk Factors                     \n                                              \nThe following is a summary of the Risk Factors\ndisclosure in this Item 1A. This summary does\nnot address all of the risks that we face.\nAdditional discussion of the risks summarized\nin this risk factor summary, and other risks\nthat we face, can be found below and should be\ncarefully considered, together with other\ninformation in this Form 10-K and our other\nfilings with the SEC, before making an\ninvestment decision regarding our securities.\n\n\u2022 The Transaction is contingent upon a number\nof conditions, including stockholder and\nregulatory approvals, which may fail to be\nsatisfied or which may delay the consummation\nof the Transaction or result in the imposition\nof conditions that could reduce the\nanticipated benefits from the Transaction or\ncause the parties to abandon the Transaction.\n\n\u2022 We are expected to incur substantial\nexpenses related to the Transaction and to the\nintegration of Discover.\n\n\u2022 We may fail to realize all of the\nanticipated benefits of the Transaction or\nthose benefits may take longer, or be more\ndifficult, to realize than expected.\n\n\u2022 Our future results may suffer if we do not\neffectively manage our expanded operations\nfollowing the Transaction.\n\n\u2022 We will be subject to business uncertainties\nand contractual restrictions while the\nTransaction is pending.\n\n\u2022 Changes and instability in the macroeconomic\nenvironment could disrupt capital markets,\nreduce consumer and business activity, and\nweaken the labor market, all of which could\nimpact borrowers\u2019 ability to service their\ndebt obligations and adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\n\n\u2022 Fluctuations in interest rates or volatility\nin the capital markets could adversely affect\nour business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\n\u2022 We may experience increases or fluctuations\nin delinquencies and credit losses, or we may\nincorrectly estimate expected losses, which\ncould result in inadequate reserves.\n\n\u2022 We may not be able to maintain adequate\ncapital or liquidity levels or may become\nsubject to revised capital or liquidity\nrequirements, which could have a negative\nimpact on our financial results and our\nability to return capital to our stockholders.\n\n\u2022 Limitations on our ability to receive\ndividends from our subsidiaries could affect\nour liquidity and ability to pay dividends and\nrepurchase our common stock.\n\n\u2022 A downgrade in our credit ratings could\nsignificantly impact our liquidity, funding\ncosts and access to the capital markets.\n\n\u2022 We face risks related to our operational,\ntechnological and organizational\ninfrastructure.\n\n\u2022 A cyber-attack or other security incident on\nus or third parties (including their supply\nchains) with which we conduct business,\nincluding an incident that results in the\ntheft, loss, manipulation or misuse of\ninformation (including personal information),\nor the disabling of systems and access to\ninformation critical to business operations,\nmay result in increased costs, reductions in\nrevenue, reputational damage, legal exposure\nand business disruptions.\n\n\u2022 We face risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models, AI, and data.\n                                              \n  22    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Compliance with new and existing domestic\nand foreign laws, regulations and regulatory\nexpectations is costly and complex.\n\n\u2022 Our required compliance with applicable laws\nand regulations related to privacy, data\nprotection and data security, in addition to\ncompliance with our own privacy policies and\ncontractual obligations to third parties, may\nincrease our costs, reduce our revenue,\nincrease our legal exposure and limit our\nability to pursue business opportunities.\n\n\u2022 Our businesses are subject to the risk of\nincreased litigation, government\ninvestigations and regulatory enforcement.\n\n\u2022 We face intense competition in all of our\nmarkets, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and results of\noperations.\n\n\u2022 Our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations may be adversely\naffected by merchants\u2019 efforts to reduce the\nfees charged by credit and debit card networks\nto facilitate card transactions, and by\nlegislation and regulation impacting such\nfees.\n\n\u2022 If we are not able to invest successfully in\nand introduce digital and other technological\ndevelopments across all our businesses, our\nfinancial performance may suffer.\n\n\u2022 We may fail to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of our mergers, acquisitions and\nstrategic partnerships.\n\n\u2022 Reputational risk and social factors may\nimpact our results and damage our brand.\n\n\u2022 If we are not able to protect our\nintellectual property, our revenue and\nprofitability could be negatively affected.\n\n\u2022 Our risk management strategies may not be\nfully effective in mitigating our risk\nexposures in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk.\n\n\u2022 Our business could be negatively affected if\nwe are unable to attract, develop, retain and\nmotivate key senior leaders and skilled\nemployees.\n\n\u2022 We face risks from catastrophic events.\n\n\u2022 Climate change manifesting as physical or\ntransition risks could adversely affect our\nbusinesses, operations and customers and\nresult in increased costs.\n\n\u2022 We face risks from the use of or changes to\nassumptions or estimates in our financial\nstatements.\n\n\u2022 The soundness of other financial\ninstitutions and other third parties, actual\nor perceived, could adversely affect us.\n                                              \n  Risks Relating to the Acquisition of        \n  Discover                                    \n                                              \nWe have identified certain additional risk\nfactors in connection with the Merger\nAgreement and the proposed Transaction. These\nrisks and the other risks associated with the\nproposed Transaction will be more fully\ndiscussed in the joint proxy\nstatement/prospectus that will be included in\nthe registration statement on Form S-4 that we\nintend to file with the SEC in connection with\nthe Transaction.\n\nThe consummation of the Transaction is\ncontingent upon the satisfaction of a number\nof conditions, including stockholder and\nregulatory approvals, that may be outside\neither party\u2019s control and that either party\nmay be unable to satisfy or obtain or which\nmay delay the consummation of the Transaction\nor result in the imposition of conditions that\ncould reduce the anticipated benefits from the\nTransaction or cause the parties to abandon\nthe Transaction.\n\nConsummation of the Transaction is contingent\nupon the satisfaction of a number of\nconditions, some of which are beyond either\nparty's control, including, among others:\n\n\u2022 adoption of the Merger Agreement by\nDiscover\u2019s stockholders\u037e\n\n\u2022 approval by our stockholders of the issuance\nof our common stock to be issued in the\nTransaction;\n\n\u2022 authorization for listing on the NYSE of the\nshares of our common stock to be issued in the\nTransaction\u037e\n                                              \n  23    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 the receipt of required regulatory\napprovals;\n\n\u2022 effectiveness of the registration statement\non Form S-4 to be filed by us in connection\nwith the Transaction\u037e and\n\n\u2022 the absence of any order, injunction, decree\nor other legal restraint preventing the\ncompletion of the Transaction.\n\nEach party\u2019s obligation to complete the\nTransaction is also subject to certain\nadditional customary conditions, including:\n\n\u2022 subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy\nof the representations and warranties of the\nother party\u037e\n\n\u2022 performance in all material respects by the\nother party of its obligations under the\nMerger Agreement\u037e and\n\n\u2022 receipt by such party of an opinion from its\ncounsel to the effect that the Merger and the\nSecond Step Merger, taken together, will\nqualify as a reorganization within the meaning\nof Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended.\n\nThese conditions to the closing of the\nTransaction may not be fulfilled in a timely\nmanner, or at all, and, accordingly, the\nTransaction may not be completed. In addition,\nthe parties can mutually decide to terminate\nthe Merger Agreement at any time, before or\nafter receipt of the requisite approvals by\nour stockholders or Discover\u2019s stockholders,\nor either party may elect to terminate the\nMerger Agreement in certain other\ncircumstances.\n\nAs a condition to granting required regulatory\napprovals, governmental entities may impose\nconditions, limitations or costs, require\ndivestitures or place restrictions on our\nconduct after the closing of the Transaction.\nSuch conditions or changes and the process of\nobtaining regulatory approvals could, among\nother things, have the effect of delaying\ncompletion of the Transaction or of imposing\nadditional costs or limitations on us\nfollowing the Transaction, any of which may\nhave an adverse effect on us.\n\nEither party may also be subject to lawsuits\nchallenging the Transaction, and adverse\nrulings in these lawsuits may delay or prevent\nthe Transaction from being completed or\nrequire either party to incur significant\ncosts to defend or settle these lawsuits. Any\ndelay in completing the Transaction could\ncause us not to realize, or to be delayed in\nrealizing, some or all of the benefits that we\nexpect to achieve if the Transaction is\nsuccessfully completed within its expected\ntime frame.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses\nrelated to the Transaction and to the\nintegration of Discover.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur a number\nof costs associated with the Transaction and\nthe integration of Discover. These costs\ninclude financial advisory, legal, accounting,\nconsulting and other advisory fees,\nseverance/employee benefit\u2010related costs,\npublic company filing fees and other\nregulatory fees and financial printing and\nother related costs. There are also a large\nnumber of processes, policies, procedures,\noperations, technologies and systems that may\nneed to be integrated.\n\nWhile we have assumed that a certain level of\ncosts will be incurred, there are many factors\nbeyond our control that could affect the total\namount or the timing of the integration\nexpenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that\nwe will incur are, by their nature, difficult\nto estimate accurately. These expenses could,\nparticularly in the near term, exceed the\nsavings that we expect to achieve from the\nelimination of duplicative expenses and the\nrealization of economies of scale. These\nintegration expenses may result in us taking\ncharges against earnings as a result of the\nTransaction or the integration of Discover,\nand the amount and timing of such charges are\nuncertain at present.\n\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated\nbenefits of the Transaction, or those benefits\nmay take longer to realize than expected due\nto factors that may be outside our control or\nDiscover\u2019s control. We may also encounter\nsignificant difficulties in integrating\nDiscover.\n\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of the proposed Transaction,\nincluding, among other things, anticipated\nrevenue and cost synergies, due to factors\nthat may be outside either party\u2019s control,\nincluding, but not limited to, changes in laws\nor regulations or in the interpretation of\nexisting laws or regulations, whether caused\nby a change in government or otherwise, or\ngeneral economic, political, legislative or\nregulatory conditions, and the outcome of any\nlegal or regulatory proceedings that may be\ncurrently pending or later instituted against\nus (before or after the Transaction) or\nagainst Discover.\n\nBoth parties have operated and, until the\ncompletion of the Transaction, will continue\nto operate, independently. The success of the\nTransaction, including anticipated benefits\nand cost savings, will depend, in part, on our\nability to successfully integrate Discover\u2019s\noperations in a manner that results in various\nbenefits and that does not materially disrupt\nexisting customer relationships or result in\ndecreased revenues due to loss of customers,\nas well as our ability to successfully\nintegrate Discover\n                                              \n  24    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ninto our Framework, compliance systems and\ncorporate culture. The process of integrating\noperations could result in a loss of key\npersonnel or cause an interruption of, or loss\nof momentum in, the activities of one or more\nof our businesses following the completion of\nthe Transaction. Inconsistencies in standards,\ncontrols, procedures and policies could\nadversely affect us following the completion\nof the Transaction. The diversion of\nmanagement\u2019s attention and any delays or\ndifficulties encountered in connection with\nthe Transaction and the integration of\nDiscover\u2019s operations could have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results and prospects.\n\nIf we experience difficulties in the\nintegration process, including those listed\nabove, we may fail to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of the Transaction in a timely\nmanner, or at all.\n\nOur future results may suffer if we do not\neffectively manage our expanded operations\nfollowing the Transaction.\n\nFollowing the Transaction, the size and scope\nof our business will increase significantly\nbeyond our current size and scope. Our future\nsuccess depends, in part, upon the ability to\nmanage our expanded businesses, which will\npose substantial challenges for management,\nincluding challenges related to the management\nand monitoring of new operations and\nassociated increased costs and complexity.\nThere can be no assurances we will be\nsuccessful or that we will realize the\nexpected operating efficiencies, cost savings\nand other benefits currently anticipated from\nthe Transaction.\n\nIn addition, following the Transaction, we may\nbe subject to increased scrutiny by, and/or\nadditional regulatory requirements of,\ngovernmental authorities as a result of the\nTransaction or the size, scope and complexity\nof our business operations, which may have an\nadverse effect on our business, operations or\nstock price.\n\nWhile the Transaction is pending, we will be\nsubject to business uncertainties and\ncontractual restrictions that could adversely\naffect our business and operations.\n\nUncertainty about the effect of the\nTransaction on employees, customers, suppliers\nand other persons with whom we or Discover\nhave a business relationship may have an\nadverse effect on our business, operations and\nstock price. Existing customers, suppliers and\nother business partners of ours and of\nDiscover could decide to no longer do business\nwith us or with Discover before the completion\nof the Transaction or with us after the\nTransaction is completed, reducing its\nanticipated benefits. Both parties are also\nsubject to certain restrictions on the conduct\nof our respective businesses while the\nTransaction is pending. As a result, certain\nprojects may be delayed or abandoned and\nbusiness decisions could be deferred. Employee\nretention may be challenging for Discover\nbefore completion of the Transaction, as\ncertain employees of Discover may experience\nuncertainty about their future roles with us\nfollowing the Transaction, and these retention\nchallenges will require us to incur additional\nexpenses in order to retain key employees of\nDiscover. If key employees of Discover depart\nbecause of issues relating to the uncertainty\nand difficulty of integration or a desire not\nto remain with Discover or with us following\nthe Transaction, the benefits of the\nTransaction could be materially diminished.\n                                              \n  General Economic and Market Risks           \n                                              \nChanges and instability in the macroeconomic\nenvironment could disrupt capital markets,\nreduce consumer and business activity, and\nweaken the labor market, all of which could\nimpact borrowers\u2019 ability to service their\ndebt obligations and adversely impact our\nfinancial results.\n\nChanges and instability in the macroeconomic\nenvironment may lead to changes in payment\npatterns, increases or fluctuations in\ndelinquencies and default rates and decrease\nconsumer spending. Because we offer a broad\narray of financial products and services to\nconsumers, small businesses and commercial\nclients, our financial results are impacted by\nthe level of consumer and business activity\nand the demand for our products and services.\nA prolonged period of economic weakness,\nvolatility, slow growth, or a significant\ndeterioration in economic conditions, in the\nU.S., Canada or the U.K., could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations as\ncustomers or commercial clients default on\ntheir loans, maintain lower deposit levels or,\nin the case of credit card accounts, carry\nlower balances and reduce credit card purchase\nactivity.\n\nSome of the factors that could disrupt capital\nmarkets, reduce consumer and business\nactivity, and weaken the labor market include\nthe following:\n\n\u2022 Monetary policy actions, such as changes to\ninterest rates, taken by the Federal Reserve\nand other central banks, such as the central\nbanks in the United Kingdom and Canada;\n\n\u2022 Geopolitical conflicts or instabilities,\nsuch as the war between Ukraine and Russia and\nthe war between Israel and Hamas, and\nincreased geopolitical tensions between the\nU.S. and China;\n                                              \n  25    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Trade wars, tariffs, labor shortages and\ndisruptions of global supply chains;\n\n\u2022 The effects of divided government in the\nU.S., including government shutdowns whether\nrecurring, prolonged or otherwise, and\ndevelopments related to the U.S. federal debt\nceiling;\n\n\u2022 Inflation and deflation, including the\neffects of related governmental responses;\n\n\u2022 Concerns over a potential recession, which\nmay lead to adjustments in spending patterns;\n\n\u2022 Lower demand for credit and shifts in\nconsumer behavior, including shifts away from\nusing credit cards, changes in deposit\npractices, and changes in and payment\npatterns; and\n\n\u2022 Ongoing changes in usage of commercial real\nestate, which may have a sustained negative\nimpact on utilization rates and values.\n\nDecreases in overall business activity and\nchanges in customer behavior may lead to\nincreases in our charge-off rate caused by\nbankruptcies and may reduce our ability to\nrecover debt that we have previously charged-\noff. Such changes may also decrease the\nreliability of our internal processes and\nmodels, including those we use to estimate our\nallowance for credit losses, particularly if\nunexpected variations in key inputs and\nassumptions cause actual losses to diverge\nfrom the projections of our models and our\nestimates become increasingly subject to\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. See \u201c We face risks\nresulting from the extensive use of models,\nAI, and data. \u201d\n\nFluctuations in interest rates or volatility\nin the capital markets could adversely affect\nour business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nLike other financial institutions, our\nbusiness is sensitive to interest rate\nmovements and the performance of the capital\nmarkets. We rely on access to the capital\nmarkets to fund our operations and to grow our\nbusiness. Our ability to borrow from other\nfinancial institutions or to engage in funding\ntransactions on favorable terms or at all\ncould be adversely affected by disruptions,\nuncertainty or volatility in the capital\nmarkets. Additionally, increased charge-offs,\nrising interest rates, increased refinancing\nactivity and other events may cause our\nsecuritization transactions to amortize\nearlier than scheduled or reduce the value of\nthe securities that we hold for liquidity\npurposes, which could accelerate our need for\nadditional funding from other sources. We\ncould also experience impairments of other\nfinancial assets and other negative impacts on\nour financial position, including possible\nconstraints on liquidity and capital, as well\nas higher costs of capital.\n\nAdditionally, changes in interest rates could\nadversely affect the results of our operations\nand financial condition. For example, if\ninflation were to remain elevated or begin to\nincrease, interest rates could increase\nfurther. Higher interest rates increase our\nborrowing costs and may require us to increase\nthe interest we pay on funds deposited with us\nand may reduce the market value of our\nsecurities holdings. If interest rates\ncontinue to increase or if higher interest\nrates persist for an extended period of time,\nour expenses may increase further. If the rate\nof economic growth decreased sharply, causing\nthe Federal Reserve to lower interest rates,\nour net income could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, a shrinking yield premium\nbetween short-term and long-term market\ninterest rates could adversely impact the\nrates that we pay on our liabilities and the\nrates that we earn on our assets and thus\naffect our profitability.\n\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating\nthe effect on our earnings, economic value and\ncapital under various scenarios that differ\nbased on assumptions about the direction and\nthe magnitude of interest rate changes. We\ntake risk mitigation actions based on those\nassessments. We face the risk that changes in\ninterest rates could materially reduce our net\ninterest income and our earnings, especially\nif actual conditions turn out to be materially\ndifferent than those we assumed.\n\nFurthermore, interest rate fluctuations and\ncompetitor responses to those changes may have\na material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations, as\ncustomers or commercial clients default on\ntheir loans, maintain lower deposit levels or,\nin the case of credit card accounts, reduce\ndemand for credit or (for existing customers)\nthe level of borrowing or purchase activity.\nFor example, increases in interest rates\nincrease debt service requirements for some of\nour borrowers, which may adversely affect\nthose borrowers\u2019 ability to pay as\ncontractually obligated. This could result in\nadditional or fluctuating delinquencies or\ncharge-offs and negatively impact our results\nof operations. These changes could reduce the\noverall yield on our interest-earning asset\nportfolio. An inability to attract or maintain\ndeposits could materially affect our ability\nto fund our business and our liquidity\nposition. Many other financial institutions\nhave increased their reliance on deposit\nfunding and, as such, we expect continued\ncompetition in the deposit markets. We cannot\npredict how this competition will affect our\ncosts. If we are required to offer higher\ninterest rates to attract or maintain\ndeposits, our funding costs will be adversely\nimpacted.\n                                              \n  26    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nChanges in valuations in the debt and equity\nmarkets could have a negative impact on the\nassets we hold in our investment portfolio.\nSuch market changes could also have a negative\nimpact on the valuation of assets for which we\nprovide servicing. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7.\nMD&A\u2014Market Risk Profile\u201d and \u201c We face\nintense competition in all of our markets \u201d\nfor additional information.\n                                              \n  Credit Risk                                 \n                                              \nWe may experience increases or fluctuations in\ndelinquencies and credit losses, or we may\nincorrectly estimate expected losses, which\ncould result in inadequate reserves.\n\nLike other lenders, we face the risk that our\ncustomers will not repay their loans. A\ncustomer\u2019s ability and willingness to repay us\ncan be adversely affected by decreases in the\nincome of the borrower or increases in their\npayment obligations to other lenders, whether\nas a result of a job loss, higher debt levels\nor rising cost of servicing debt, inflation\noutpacing wage growth, or by restricted\navailability of credit generally. We may fail\nto quickly identify and reduce our exposure to\ncustomers that are likely to default on their\npayment obligations, whether by closing credit\nlines or restricting authorizations. Our\nability to manage credit risk also is affected\nby legal or regulatory changes (such as\nrestrictions on collections, bankruptcy laws,\nminimum payment regulations and re-age\nguidance), competitors\u2019 actions and consumer\nbehavior, and depends on the effectiveness of\nour collections staff, techniques and models.\n\nRising credit losses or leading indicators of\nrising credit losses (such as higher\ndelinquencies, higher rates of nonperforming\nloans, higher bankruptcy rates, lower\ncollateral values, elevated unemployment rates\nor changing market terms) may require us to\nincrease our allowance for credit losses,\nwhich would decrease our profitability if we\nare unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to\ncompensate for higher credit losses, whether\nactual or expected. In particular, we face the\nfollowing risks in this area:\n\n\u2022 Missed Payments: Our customers may fail to\nmake required payments on time and may default\nor become delinquent. Loan charge-offs\n(including from bankruptcies) are generally\npreceded by missed payments or other\nindications of worsening financial conditions\nfor our customers. Historically, customers are\nmore likely to miss payments during an\neconomic downturn, recession, periods of high\nunemployment, or prolonged periods of slow\neconomic growth. Customers might also be more\nlikely to miss payments if the payment burdens\non their existing debt grow due to rising\ninterest rates, or if inflation outpaces wage\ngrowth. Additionally, the CFPB has, among\nother things, proposed changes to lower the\nsafe harbor amount for past due fees that a\ncredit card issuer can charge on consumer\ncredit card accounts, which could result in\nchanges in consumer repayment patterns.\n\n\u2022 Incorrect Estimates of Expected Credit\nLosses: The credit quality of our loan\nportfolios can have a significant impact on\nour earnings. We allow for and reserve against\ncredit risks based on our assessment of\nexpected credit losses in our loan portfolios.\nThis process, which is critical to our\nfinancial condition and results of operations,\nrequires complex judgments, including\nforecasts of economic conditions. We may\nunderestimate our expected credit losses and\nfail to hold an allowance for credit losses\nsufficient to account for these credit losses.\nIncorrect assumptions could lead to material\nunderestimations of expected credit losses and\nan inadequate allowance for credit losses. See\n\u201c We face risks resulting from the extensive\nuse of models, AI, and data. \u201d\n\n\u2022 Inaccurate Underwriting: Our ability to\naccurately assess the creditworthiness of our\ncustomers may diminish, which could result in\nan increase in our credit losses and a\ndeterioration of our returns. See \u201c Our risk\nmanagement strategies may not be fully\neffective in mitigating our risk exposures in\nall market environments or against all types\nof risk .\u201d\n\n\u2022 Business Mix: We engage in a diverse mix of\nbusinesses with a broad range of potential\ncredit exposure. Because we originate a\nrelatively greater proportion of consumer\nloans in our loan portfolio compared to other\nlarge bank peers and originate both prime and\nsubprime credit card accounts and auto loans,\nwe may experience higher delinquencies and a\ngreater number of accounts charging off, as\nwell as greater fluctuations in those metrics,\ncompared to other large bank peers, which\ncould result in increased credit losses,\noperating costs and regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, a change in this business mix\nover time to include proportionally more\nconsumer loans or subprime credit card\naccounts or auto loans could adversely affect\nthe credit quality of our loan portfolios.\n                                              \n  27    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022 Increasing Charge-off Recognition/Allowance\nfor Credit Losses: We account for the\nallowance for credit losses according to\naccounting and regulatory guidelines and\nrules, including Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) standards and the\nFederal Financial Institutions Examination\nCouncil (\u201cFFIEC\u201d) Account Management Guidance.\nWe measure our allowance for credit losses\nunder the CECL standard, which is based on\nmanagement\u2019s best estimate of expected\nlifetime credit losses. The impact of\nmeasuring our allowance for credit losses on\nour results will depend on the characteristics\nof our financial instruments, economic\nconditions, and our economic and loss\nforecasts. The application of the CECL\nstandard may require us to increase reserves\nfaster and to a higher level in an economic\ndownturn, resulting in greater adverse impact\nto our results and our capital ratios than we\nwould have experienced in similar\ncircumstances prior to the adoption of CECL.\nDue to our business mix and the impact of\ncredit losses on our income statement as\ncompared to many of our large bank peers, we\ncould be disproportionately affected by use of\nthe CECL standard.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Asset Values: The collateral we\nhave on secured loans could be insufficient to\ncompensate us for credit losses. When\ncustomers default on their secured loans, we\nattempt to recover collateral where\npermissible and appropriate. However, the\nvalue of the collateral may not be sufficient\nto compensate us for the amount of the unpaid\nloan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering\nthe remaining balance from our customers.\nDecreases in real estate and other asset\nvalues adversely affect the collateral value\nfor our commercial lending activities, while\nthe auto business is similarly exposed to\ncollateral risks arising from the auction\nmarkets that determine used car prices.\nBorrowers may be less likely to continue\nmaking payments on loans if the value of the\nproperty used as collateral for the loan is\nless than what the borrower owes, even if the\nborrower is still financially able to make the\npayments. In that circumstance, the recovery\nof such property could be insufficient to\ncompensate us for the value of these loans\nupon a default. In our auto business, business\nand economic conditions that negatively affect\nhousehold incomes and savings, housing prices\nand consumer behavior, as well as\ntechnological advances that make older cars\nobsolete faster, could decrease (i) the demand\nfor new and/or used vehicles and (ii) the\nvalue of the collateral underlying our\nportfolio of auto loans, which could cause the\nnumber of consumers who become delinquent or\ndefault on their loans to increase.\n\n\u2022 Geographic and Industry Concentration:\nAlthough our consumer lending is\ngeographically diversified, approximately\n40.5% of our commercial real estate loan\nportfolio is concentrated in the Northeast\nregion. The regional economic conditions in\nthe Northeast affect the demand for our\ncommercial products and services as well as\nthe ability of our customers to repay their\ncommercial real estate loans and the value of\nthe collateral securing these loans. An\neconomic downturn or prolonged period of slow\neconomic growth in, or a catastrophic event or\nnatural disaster that disproportionately\naffects the Northeast region could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the performance of\nour commercial real estate loan portfolio and\nour results of operations. In addition, our\nCommercial Banking strategy includes an\nindustry-specific focus. If any of the\nindustries that we focus on experience\nchanges, we may experience increased credit\nlosses and our results of operations could be\nadversely impacted.\n                                              \n   Capital and Liquidity Risk                 \n                                              \nWe may not be able to maintain adequate\ncapital or liquidity levels or may become\nsubject to revised capital or liquidity\nrequirements, which could have a negative\nimpact on our financial results and our\nability to return capital to our stockholders.\n\nFinancial institutions are subject to\nextensive and complex capital and liquidity\nrequirements, which are subject to change.\nThese requirements affect our ability to lend,\ngrow deposit balances, make acquisitions and\ndistribute capital. Failure to maintain\nadequate capital or liquidity levels, whether\ndue to adverse developments in our business or\nthe economy or to changes in the applicable\nrequirements, could subject us to a variety of\nrestrictions and/or remedial actions imposed\nby our regulators. These include limitations\non the ability to pay dividends or repurchase\nshares and the issuance of a capital directive\nto increase capital. Such limitations or\ncapital directive could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and results of\noperations. For example, changes to applicable\ncapital, liquidity, or other regulations, such\nas the changes proposed in the Basel III\nFinalization Proposal and the LTD Proposal,\ncould result in increased regulatory capital\nrequirements, operating expenses or cost of\nfunding, which could negatively affect our\nfinancial results or our ability to distribute\ncapital.\n\nWe consider various factors in the management\nof capital, including the impact of both\ninternal and supervisory stress scenarios on\nour capital levels as determined by our\ninternal modeling and the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nestimation of losses in supervisory stress\nscenarios that are used to annually set our\nstress capital buffer requirement. There can\nbe significant differences between our\nmodeling and the Federal Reserve\u2019s projections\nfor a given supervisory stress scenario and\nbetween the capital needs suggested by our\ninternal stress scenarios and the supervisory\nscenarios. Therefore, although our estimated\ncapital levels under stress disclosed as part\nof the stress testing processes may suggest\nthat we have a particular capacity to return\ncapital to stockholders\n                                              \n  28    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nand remain well capitalized under stress, the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s modeling, our internal\nmodeling of another scenario or other factors\nrelated to our capital management process may\nreflect a lower capacity to return capital to\nstockholders than that indicated by the\nprojections released in the stress testing\nprocesses. This in turn, could lead to\nrestrictions on our ability to pay dividends\nand engage in repurchases of our common stock.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u201d for additional information.\n\nWe also consider various factors in the\nmanagement of liquidity, including maintaining\nsufficient liquid assets to meet the\nrequirements of several internal and\nregulatory stress tests. There can be\nsignificant differences in estimated liquidity\nneeds between internal and regulatory stress\ntesting, and liquidity resources required to\nmeet regulatory requirements, such as\napplicable LCR and NSFR requirements, may\nexceed what would otherwise be required to\nsatisfy internal liquidity metrics and stress\ntesting. Regulatory liquidity stress testing\nand regulatory liquidity requirements may,\ntherefore, require us to take actions to\nincrease our liquid assets or alter our\nactivities or funding sources, which could\nnegatively affect our financial results or our\nability to return capital to our stockholders.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u201d for additional information.\n\nLimitations on our ability to receive\ndividends from our subsidiaries could affect\nour liquidity and ability to pay dividends and\nrepurchase our common stock.\n\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity\nfrom our subsidiaries, including, without\nlimitation, the Bank and our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries. Dividends to us from these\ndirect and indirect subsidiaries have\nrepresented a major source of funds for us to\npay dividends on our common and preferred\nstock, repurchase our common stock, make\npayments on corporate debt securities and meet\nother obligations. These capital distributions\nmay be limited by law, regulation or\nsupervisory policy. There are various federal\nlaw limitations on the extent to which the\nBank can finance or otherwise supply funds to\nus through dividends and loans. These\nlimitations include minimum regulatory capital\nand capital buffer requirements, federal\nbanking law requirements concerning the\npayment of dividends out of net profits or\nsurplus, and Sections 23A and 23B of the\nFederal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing\ntransactions between an insured depository\ninstitution and its affiliates, as well as\ngeneral federal regulatory oversight to\nprevent unsafe or unsound practices. Our\nbroker-dealer subsidiaries are also subject to\nlaws and regulations, including net capital\nrequirements, that may limit their ability to\npay dividends or make other distributions to\nus. If our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not\nsufficient to make dividend payments to us\nwhile maintaining adequate capital levels, our\nliquidity may be affected and we may not be\nable to make dividend payments to our common\nor preferred stockholders, repurchase our\ncommon stock, make payments on outstanding\ncorporate debt securities or meet other\nobligations, each and any of which could have\na material adverse impact on our results of\noperations, our financial position or the\nperception of our financial health. The\nfrequency and size of any future dividends to\nour stockholders and our stock repurchases\nwill depend upon regulatory limitations\nimposed by our regulators and our results of\noperations, financial condition, capital\nlevels, cash requirements, future prospects,\nregulatory review and other factors as further\ndescribed in \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation.\u201d\n\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could\nsignificantly impact our liquidity, funding\ncosts and access to the capital markets.\n\nOur credit ratings are based on a number of\nfactors, including financial strength, as well\nas factors not within our control, including\nconditions affecting the financial services\nindustry generally, the macroeconomic\nenvironment and changes made by rating\nagencies to their methodologies or ratings\ncriteria. Our ratings could be downgraded at\nany time and without any notice by any of the\nrating agencies, which could, among other\nthings, adversely affect our ability to borrow\nfunds, increase our funding cost, increase our\ncost of capital, limit the number of investors\nor counterparties willing to do business with\nor lend to us, adversely limit our ability to\naccess the capital markets and have a negative\nimpact on our results of operations.\n                                              \n  Operational Risk                            \n                                              \nWe face risks related to our operational,\ntechnological and organizational\ninfrastructure.\nOur ability to retain and attract customers\ndepends on our ability to develop, operate,\nand adapt our technology and organizational\ninfrastructure in a rapidly changing\nenvironment.

We are also heavily\ndependent on the security, capability,\nintegrity and continuous availability of the\ntechnology systems that we use to manage our\ninternal financial and other systems, monitor\nrisk and compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, provide services to our\ncustomers, develop and offer new products and\ncommunicate with stakeholders.\n\nWe also face risk of adverse customer impacts\nand business disruption arising from the\nexecution of strategic initiatives and\noperational plans we may pursue across our\noperations. For example, when we launch a new\nproduct, service or platform for the delivery\nor distribution of products or services,\nacquire or invest in a business or make\nchanges to an existing product, service or\ndelivery platform, there is the risk of\nexecution issues related to changes to\noperations or processes. These issues could be\ndriven by insufficient mitigation of\noperational risks associated with the change\nimplementation, inadequate training, failure\nto account for new or changed requirements, or\nfailure to identify or address impacted\ndownstream processes.\n\nIn addition, we may experience increased costs\nand/or disruptions due to our hybrid work\nmodel, which could also affect our ability to\noperate effectively and maintain our corporate\nculture.\n\nIf we do not maintain the necessary\noperational, technological and organizational\ninfrastructure to operate our business,\nincluding to maintain the resiliency and\nsecurity of that infrastructure, our business\nand reputation could be materially adversely\naffected. We also are subject to disruptions\nto our systems arising from events that are\nwholly or partially beyond our control, which\nmay include computer viruses; computer,\ntelecommunications, network, utility,\nelectronic or physical infrastructure outages;\nbugs, errors, insider threats, design flaws in\nsystems or platforms; availability and quality\nof vulnerability patches from key vendors,\ncyber-attacks and other security incidents,\nnatural disasters, other damage to property or\nphysical assets, or events arising from local\nor larger scale politics, including civil\nunrest, terrorist acts and military conflict.\nAny failure to maintain our infrastructure or\nprevent disruption of our systems and\napplications could diminish our ability to\noperate our businesses, service customer\naccounts and protect customers\u2019 information,\nor result in potential liability to customers,\nreputational damage, regulatory intervention\nand customers\u2019 loss of confidence in our\nbusinesses, any of which could result in a\nmaterial adverse effect.\n\nWe also rely on the business infrastructure\nand systems of third parties (and their supply\nchains) with which we do business and/or to\nwhom we outsource the operation, maintenance\nand development of our information technology\nand communications systems. We have\nsubstantially migrated primarily all aspects\nof our core information technology systems and\ncustomer-facing applications to third-party\ncloud infrastructure platforms, principally\nAWS. If we fail to architect, administer or\noversee these environments in a well-managed,\nsecure and effective manner, or if such\nplatforms become unavailable, are disrupted,\nfail to scale, do not operate as designed, or\ndo not meet their service level agreements for\nany reason, we may experience unplanned\nservice disruption or unforeseen costs which\ncould result in material harm to our business\nand operations. We must successfully develop\nand maintain information, financial reporting,\ndisclosure, privacy, data protection, data\nsecurity and other controls adapted to our\nreliance on outside platforms and providers.\nIn addition, AWS, or other service providers\n(including, without limitation, those who also\nrely on AWS) could experience system or\ntelecommunication breakdowns or failures,\noutages, degradation in service, downtime,\nfailure to scale, software bugs, design flaws,\ncyber-attacks and other security incidents,\ninsider threats, adverse changes to financial\ncondition, bankruptcy, or other adverse\nconditions, (including conditions which\ninterfere with our access to and use of AWS),\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on\nour business and reputation. We also face a\nrisk that our third-party service providers\nmight be unable or unwilling to continue to\nprovide these or other services to meet our\ncurrent or future needs in an efficient, cost-\neffective, or favorable manner or may\nterminate or seek to terminate their\ncontractual relationship with us. Any\ntransition to alternative third-party service\nproviders or internal solutions may be\ndifficult to implement, may cause us to incur\nsignificant time and expense and may disrupt\nor degrade our ability to deliver our products\nand services. Thus, the substantial amount of\nour infrastructure that we outsource to AWS or\nto other third-party service providers may\nincrease our risk exposure.\n\nAny disruptions, failures or inaccuracies of\nour operational processes, technology systems\nand models, including those associated with\nimprovements or modifications to such\ntechnology systems and models, or failure to\nidentify or effectively respond to operational\nrisks in a timely manner and continue to\ndeliver our services through an operational\ndisruption, could cause us to be unable to\nmarket and manage our products and services,\nmanage our risk, meet our regulatory\nobligations or report our financial results in\na timely and accurate manner, all of which\ncould have a negative impact on our results of\noperations. In addition, our ongoing\ninvestments in infrastructure, which are\nnecessary to maintain a competitive business,\nintegrate acquisitions and establish scalable\noperations, may increase our expenses. As our\nbusiness develops, changes or expands,\nadditional expenses can arise as a result of a\nreevaluation of business strategies or risks,\nmanagement of outsourced services, asset\npurchases or other acquisitions, structural\nreorganization, compliance with new laws or\nregulations, the integration of newly acquired\nbusinesses, or the prevention or occurrence of\ncyber-attacks and other security incidents. If\nwe are\n                                              \n  30    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nunable to successfully manage our expenses,\nour financial results will be negatively\naffected. Changes to our business, including\nthose resulting from our strategic\nimperatives, also require robust governance to\nensure that our objectives are executed as\nintended without adversely impacting our\ncustomers, associates, operations or financial\nperformance. Ineffective change management\noversight and governance over the execution of\nour key projects and initiatives could expose\nus to operational, strategic and reputational\nrisk and could negatively impact customers or\nour financial performance.\n\nA cyber-attack or other security incident on\nus or third parties (including their supply\nchains) with which we conduct business,\nincluding an incident that results in the\ntheft, loss, manipulation or misuse of\ninformation (including personal information),\nor the disabling of systems and access to\ninformation critical to business operations,\nmay result in increased costs, reductions in\nrevenue, reputational damage, legal exposure\nand business disruptions.\n\nOur ability to provide our products and\nservices and communicate with our customers,\ndepends upon the management and safeguarding\nof information systems and infrastructure,\nnetworks, software, data, technology,\nmethodologies and business secrets, including\nthose of our service providers. Our products\nand services involve the collection,\nauthentication, management, usage, storage,\ntransmission and destruction of sensitive and\nconfidential information, including personal\ninformation, regarding our customers and their\naccounts, our employees, our partners and\nother third parties with which we do business.\nWe also have arrangements in place with third-\nparty business partners through which we share\nand receive information about their customers\nwho are or may become our customers. The\nfinancial services industry, including Capital\nOne, is particularly at risk because of the\nincreased use of and reliance on digital\nbanking products and other digital services,\nincluding mobile banking products, such as\nmobile payments, and other internet- and\ncloud-based products and applications, and the\ndevelopment of additional remote connectivity\nsolutions, which increase cybersecurity risks\nand exposure. In addition, global events and\ngeopolitical instability (including, without\nlimitation, the war between Israel and Hamas,\nthe war between Ukraine and Russia and the\nrelated sanctions imposed by the U.S. and\nother countries, and increased geopolitical\ntensions between the U.S. and China) may lead\nto increased nation state targeting of\nfinancial institutions in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nTechnologies, systems, networks and other\ndevices of Capital One, as well as those of\nour employees, service providers, partners and\nother third parties with whom we interact,\nhave been and may continue to be the subject\nof cyber-attacks and other security incidents,\nincluding computer viruses, hacking, malware,\nransomware, supply chain attacks,\nvulnerabilities, credential stuffing, account\ntakeovers, insider threats, business email\ncompromise scams or phishing or other forms of\nsocial engineering. Such cyber-attacks and\nother security incidents are designed to lead\nto various harmful outcomes, such as\nunauthorized transactions in Capital One\naccounts, unauthorized or unintended access to\nor release, gathering, monitoring, disclosure,\nloss, destruction, corruption, disablement,\nencryption, misuse, modification or other\nprocessing of confidential or sensitive\ninformation (including personal information),\nintellectual property, software, methodologies\nor business secrets, disruption, sabotage or\ndegradation of service, systems or networks,\nan attempt to extort Capital One, its third-\nparty service providers or its business\npartners or other damage. Cyber-attacks and\nother security incidents that occur in the\nsupply chain of third parties with which we\ninteract could also negatively impact Capital\nOne.\n\nThese threats may derive from, among other\nthings, error, fraud or malice on the part of\nour employees, insiders, or third parties or\nmay result from accidental technological\nfailure or design flaws. Any of these parties\nmay also attempt to fraudulently induce\nemployees, service providers, customers,\npartners or other third-party users of our\nsystems or networks to disclose confidential\nor sensitive information (including personal\ninformation) in order to gain access to our\nsystems, networks or data or that of our\ncustomers, partners, or third parties with\nwhom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or\notherwise improper payment. For instance, any\nparty that obtains our confidential or\nsensitive information (including personal\ninformation) through a cyber-attack or other\nsecurity incident may use this information for\nransom, to be paid by us or a third party, as\npart of a fraudulent activity that is part of\na broader criminal activity, or for other\nillicit purposes. Additionally, the failure of\nour employees, third-party service providers\nor business partners, or their respective\nsupply chains, to exercise sound judgment and\nvigilance when targeted with social\nengineering or other cyber-attacks may\nincrease our vulnerability.\n\nFor example, on July 29, 2019, we announced\nthat on March 22 and 23, 2019 an outside\nindividual gained unauthorized access to our\nsystems (the \u201c2019 Cybersecurity Incident\u201d).\nThis individual obtained certain types of\npersonal information relating to people who\nhad applied for our credit card products and\nto our credit card customers. While the 2019\nCybersecurity Incident has been remediated, it\nresulted in fines, litigation, consent orders,\nsettlements, government investigations and\nother regulatory enforcement inquiries. Cyber\nand information security risks for large\nfinancial institutions like us continue to\nincrease due to the proliferation of new\ntechnologies, the industry-wide shift to\nreliance upon the internet to conduct\nfinancial transactions, the increased\nsophistication and activities of malicious\nactors, organized crime, perpetrators of\nfraud, hackers, terrorists, activists,\nextremist parties, formal and informal\ninstrumentalities of foreign governments,\nstate-sponsored or nation-state actors and\nother external parties and the growing use of\nAI by threat actors. In addition, our\ncustomers access our products and services\nusing personal devices that are necessarily\nexternal to our security control systems.\nThere has also been a significant\nproliferation of\n                                              \n  31    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nconsumer information available on the internet\nresulting from breaches of third-party\nentities, including personal information, log-\nin credentials and authentication data. These\nthird-party breach events could create a\nthreat for our customers if their Capital One\nlog-in credentials are the same as or similar\nto the credentials that have been compromised\non other internet sites. This threat could\ninclude the risk of unauthorized account\naccess, data loss and fraud. The use of AI,\n\u201cbots\u201d or other automation software can\nincrease the velocity and efficacy of these\ntypes of attacks. As our employees are\noperating under our hybrid work model, our\nremote interaction with employees, service\nproviders, partners and other third parties on\nsystems, networks and environments over which\nwe have less control (such as through\nemployees\u2019 personal devices) increases our\ncybersecurity risk exposure. We will likely\nface an increasing number of attempted cyber-\nattacks as we expand our mobile and other\ninternet-based products and services, as well\nas our usage of mobile and cloud technologies\nand as we provide more of these services to a\ngreater number of retail banking customers.\n\nThe methods and techniques employed by\nmalicious actors develop and evolve rapidly,\nincluding from emerging technologies, such as\nadvanced forms of AI and quantum computing,\nare increasingly sophisticated and often are\nnot fully recognized or understood until after\nthey have occurred, and some techniques could\noccur and persist for an extended period of\ntime before being detected and remediated. For\nexample, although we immediately fixed the\nconfiguration vulnerability that was exploited\nin the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident once we\ndiscovered the unauthorized access, a period\nof time elapsed between the occurrence of the\nunauthorized access and the time when we\ndiscovered it. In other circumstances, we and\nour service providers and other third parties\nwith which we interact may be unable to\nanticipate or identify certain attack methods\nor techniques in order to implement effective\npreventative or detective measures or mitigate\nor remediate the damages caused in a timely\nmanner. We may also be unable to hire, develop\nand retain talent that keeps pace with the\nrapidly changing cyber threat landscape, and\nwhich are capable of preventing, detecting,\nmitigating or remediating these risks.\nAlthough we seek to maintain a robust suite of\nauthentication and layered information\nsecurity controls, any one or combination of\nthese controls could fail to prevent, detect,\nmitigate, remediate or recover from these\nrisks in a timely manner.\n\nAn actual, suspected, threatened or alleged\ndisruption or breach, including as a result of\na cyber-attack such as the 2019 Cybersecurity\nIncident, or media (including social media)\nreports of alleged or perceived security\nvulnerabilities or incidents at Capital One or\nat our service providers, could result in\nsignificant legal and financial exposure,\nregulatory intervention, litigation,\nenforcement actions, remediation costs, card\nreissuance, supervisory liability, damage to\nour reputation or loss of confidence in the\nsecurity of our systems, products and services\nthat could adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, new regulations may require us to\npublicly disclose certain information about\ncertain cybersecurity incidents before they\nhave been resolved or fully investigated.\nThere can be no assurance that unauthorized\naccess or cyber incidents similar to the 2019\nCybersecurity Incident will not occur or that\nwe will not suffer material losses in the\nfuture. If future attacks are successful or if\ncustomers are unable to access their accounts\nonline for other reasons, it could adversely\nimpact our ability to service customer\naccounts or loans, complete financial\ntransactions for our customers or otherwise\noperate any of our businesses or services. In\naddition, a breach or attack affecting one of\nour service providers or other third parties\nwith which we interact could harm our business\neven if we do not control the service that is\nattacked.\n\nFurther, our ability to monitor our service\nproviders\u2019 and other business partners\u2019\ncybersecurity practices is inherently limited.\nAlthough the agreements that we have in place\nwith our service providers (and other business\npartners) generally include requirements\nrelating to privacy, data protection and data\nsecurity, we cannot guarantee that such\nagreements will prevent a cyber incident\nimpacting our systems or information or enable\nus to obtain adequate or any reimbursement\nfrom our service providers or other business\npartners in the event we should suffer any\nsuch incidents. However, due to applicable\nlaws and regulations or contractual\nobligations, we may be held responsible for\ncyber incidents attributed to our service\nproviders and other business partners as they\nrelate to the information we share with them.\n\nIn addition, we continue to incur increased\ncosts with respect to preventing, detecting,\ninvestigating, mitigating, remediating, and\nrecovering from cybersecurity risks, as well\nas any related attempted fraud. In order to\naddress ongoing and future risks, we must\nexpend significant resources to support\nprotective security measures, investigate and\nremediate any vulnerabilities of our\ninformation systems and infrastructure and\ninvest in new technology designed to mitigate\nsecurity risks. Further, high profile cyber\nincidents at Capital One or other large\nfinancial institutions could undermine our\ncompetitive advantage and divert management\nattention and resources, lead to a general\nloss of customer confidence in financial\ninstitutions that could negatively affect us,\nincluding harming the market perception of the\neffectiveness of our security measures or the\nglobal financial system in general, which\ncould result in reduced use of our financial\nproducts. We have insurance against some cyber\nrisks and attacks; nonetheless, our insurance\ncoverage may not be sufficient to offset the\nimpact of a material loss event (including if\nour insurer denies coverage as to any\nparticular claim in the future), and such\ninsurance may increase in cost or cease to be\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, or\nat all, in the future.\n                                              \n  32    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe face risks resulting from the extensive use\nof models, AI, and data.\n\nWe rely on quantitative models and the use of\nAI, as well as our ability to manage and\naggregate data in an accurate and timely\nmanner, to assess and manage our various risk\nexposures, create estimates and forecasts, and\nmanage compliance with regulatory capital\nrequirements. We continue to invest in\nbuilding new capabilities that employ new AI\ntechnologies such as generative AI, and we\nexpect our use of these technologies to\nincrease over time. However, there are\nsignificant risks involved in utilizing models\nand AI and no assurance can be provided that\nour use will produce only intended or\nbeneficial results. AI may subject us to new\nor heightened legal, regulatory, ethical, or\nother challenges; and negative public opinion\nof AI could impair the acceptance of AI\nsolutions. If the models or AI solutions that\nwe create or use are deficient, inaccurate or\ncontroversial, we could incur operational\ninefficiencies, competitive harm, legal\nliability, brand or reputational harm, or\nother adverse impacts on our business and\nfinancial results. We also may incur liability\nthrough the violation of applicable laws and\nregulations, third-party intellectual\nproperty, privacy or other rights, or\ncontracts to which we are a party.\n\nWe may use models and AI in processes such as\ndetermining the pricing of various products,\nidentifying potentially fraudulent\ntransactions, grading loans and extending\ncredit, measuring interest rate and other\nmarket risks, predicting deposit levels or\nloan losses, assessing capital adequacy,\ncalculating managerial and regulatory capital\nlevels, estimating the value of financial\ninstruments and balance sheet items, and other\noperational functions. Development and\nimplementation of some of these models , such\nas the models for credit loss accounting under\nCECL, require us to make difficult, subjective\nand complex judgments. Our risk reporting and\nmanagement, including business decisions based\non information incorporating models and the\nuse of AI, depend on the effectiveness of our\nmodels and AI and our policies, programs,\nprocesses and practices governing how data,\nmodels and AI, as applicable, are acquired,\nvalidated, stored, protected, processed and\nanalyzed. Any issues with the quality or\neffectiveness of our data aggregation and\nvalidation procedures, as well as the quality\nand integrity of data inputs, formulas or\nalgorithms, could result in inaccurate\nforecasts, ineffective risk management\npractices or inaccurate risk reporting. In\naddition, models and AI based on historical\ndata sets might not be accurate predictors of\nfuture outcomes and their ability to\nappropriately predict future outcomes may\ndegrade over time due to limited historical\npatterns, extreme or unanticipated market\nmovements or customer behavior and liquidity,\nespecially during severe market downturns or\nstress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic\nevents).\n\nWhile we continuously update our policies,\nprograms, processes and practices, many of our\ndata management, modeling, AI, aggregation and\nimplementation processes are manual and may be\nsubject to human error, data limitations,\nprocess delays or system failure. Failure to\nmanage data effectively and to aggregate data\nin an accurate and timely manner may limit our\nability to manage current and emerging risk,\nto produce accurate financial, regulatory and\noperational reporting as well as to manage\nchanging business needs. If our Framework is\nineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses\nwhich could materially adversely affect our\nresults of operation or financial condition.\nAlso, any information we provide to the public\nor to our regulators based on incorrectly\ndesigned or implemented models or AI could be\ninaccurate or misleading. Some of the\ndecisions that our regulators make, including\nthose related to capital distribution to our\nstockholders, could be affected adversely due\nto the perception that the quality of the\ndata, models and AI used to generate the\nrelevant information is insufficient. In\naddition, regulation of AI is rapidly evolving\nworldwide as legislators and regulators are\nincreasingly focused on these powerful\nemerging technologies. The technologies\nunderlying AI and its uses are subject to a\nvariety of laws and regulations, including\nintellectual property, privacy, data\nprotection and information security, consumer\nprotection, competition, and equal opportunity\nlaws, and are expected to be subject to\nincreased regulation and new laws or new\napplications of existing laws and regulations.\nAI is the subject of ongoing review by various\nU.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, and\nvarious U.S. states and other foreign\njurisdictions are applying, or are considering\napplying, their platform moderation, privacy,\ndata protection and data security laws and\nregulations to AI or are considering general\nlegal frameworks for AI. We may not be able to\nanticipate how to respond to these rapidly\nevolving frameworks, and we may need to expend\nresources to adjust our offerings in certain\njurisdictions if the legal frameworks are\ninconsistent across jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, because AI technology itself is\nhighly complex and rapidly developing, it is\nnot possible to predict all of the legal,\noperational or technological risks that may\narise relating to the use of AI.\n                                              \n  Legal and Regulatory Risk                   \n                                              \nCompliance with new and existing domestic and\nforeign laws, regulations and regulatory\nexpectations is costly and complex.\n\nA wide array of laws and regulations,\nincluding banking and consumer lending laws\nand regulations, apply to every aspect of our\nbusiness and these laws can be uncertain and\nevolving. We and our subsidiaries are also\nsubject to supervision and examination by\nmultiple regulators both in the U.S. and\nabroad, and the manner in which our regulators\ninterpret applicable laws and regulations may\naffect how we comply with them. Failure to\ncomply with these laws and regulations, even\nif the failure was inadvertent or reflects a\ndifference in interpretation or conflicting\nlegal requirements, could subject us to\nrestrictions\n                                              \n  33    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\non our business activities, fines, criminal\nsanctions and other penalties, and/or damage\nto our reputation with regulators, our\ncustomers or the public. Hiring, training and\nretaining qualified compliance and legal\npersonnel, and establishing and maintaining\nrisk management and compliance-related\nsystems, infrastructure and processes, is\ndifficult and may lead to increased expenses.\nThese efforts and the associated costs could\nlimit our ability to invest in other business\nopportunities. In addition, actions, behaviors\nor practices by us, our employees or\nrepresentatives that are illegal, unethical or\ncontrary to our core values could harm us, our\nstockholders or customers or damage the\nintegrity of the financial markets and are\nsubject to regulatory scrutiny across\njurisdictions. Violations of law by other\nfinancial institutions may also result in\nincreased regulatory scrutiny of our business.\n\nApplicable rules and regulations may affect us\ndisproportionately compared to our competitors\nor in an unforeseen manner. For example, we\nhave a large number of customer accounts in\nour credit card and auto lending businesses\nand we have made the strategic choice to\noriginate and service subprime credit card and\nauto loans, which typically have higher\ndelinquencies and charge-offs than prime\ncustomer accounts. As a result, we have\nsignificant involvement with credit bureau\nreporting and the collection and recovery of\ndelinquent and charged-off debt, primarily\nthrough customer communications, the filing of\nlitigation against customers in default, the\nperiodic sale of charged-off debt and vehicle\nrepossession. These and other consumer lending\nactivities are subject to enhanced legal and\nregulatory scrutiny from regulators, courts\nand legislators. Any future changes to or\nlegal liabilities resulting from our business\npractices in these areas, including our debt\ncollection practices and the fees we charge,\nwhether mandated by regulators, courts,\nlegislators or otherwise, could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our financial\ncondition.\n\nThe legislative and regulatory environment is\nbeyond our control, may change rapidly and\nunpredictably, and may negatively influence\nour revenue, costs, earnings, growth,\nliquidity and capital levels. For example, the\nCFPB has announced several initiatives related\nto the amounts and types of fees financial\ninstitutions may charge, including by issuing\na proposed rule that would, among other\nthings, significantly lower the safe harbor\namount for past due fees that a credit card\nissuer can charge on consumer credit card\naccounts. Such changes could affect our\nability or willingness to provide certain\nproducts or services, necessitate changes to\nthe our business practices, or reduce our\nrevenues. There may also be future rulemaking\nin emerging regulatory areas such as climate-\nrelated risks and new technologies. Adoption\nof new technologies, such as distributed\nledger technologies, tokenization, cloud\ncomputing, AI and machine learning\ntechnologies, can present unforeseen\nchallenges in applying and relying on existing\ncompliance systems. In addition, some laws and\nregulations may be subject to litigation or\nother challenges that delay or modify their\nimplementation and impact on us.\n\nCertain laws and regulations, and any\ninterpretations and applications with respect\nthereto, are generally intended to protect\nconsumers, borrowers, depositors, the DIF, the\nU.S. banking and financial system, and\nfinancial markets as a whole, but not\nstockholders. Our success depends on our\nability to maintain compliance with both\nexisting and new laws and regulations. For a\ndescription of the material laws and\nregulations, including those related to the\nconsumer lending business, to which we are\nsubject, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation.\u201d\n\nOur required compliance with applicable laws\nand regulations related to privacy, data\nprotection and data security, in addition to\ncompliance with our own privacy policies and\ncontractual obligations to third parties, may\nincrease our costs, reduce our revenue,\nincrease our legal exposure and limit our\nability to pursue business opportunities.\n\nWe are subject to a variety of continuously\nevolving and developing laws and regulations\nin the United States at the federal, state and\nlocal level regarding privacy, data protection\nand data security, including those related to\nthe collection, storage, handling, use,\ndisclosure, transfer, security and other\nprocessing of personal information. For\nexample, at the federal level, we are subject\nto the GLBA and the FCRA, among other laws and\nregulations. Moreover, legislative changes\nhave been proposed in the U.S. Congress for\nmore comprehensive privacy, data protection\nand data security legislation, to which we may\nbe subject if passed. The enactment of CIRCIA,\nonce rulemaking is complete, will require,\namong other things, certain companies to\nreport significant cyber incidents to the CISA\nwithin 72 hours from the time the company\nreasonably believes the incident occurred. At\nthe state level, California has enacted the\nCPRA, and various other states also have\nenacted or are in the process of enacting\nstate-level privacy, data protection and/or\ndata security laws and regulations, with which\nwe may be required to comply. Additionally,\nthe Federal Banking Agencies, as well as the\nSEC and related self\u2010regulatory organizations,\nregularly issue guidance regarding\ncybersecurity that is intended to enhance\ncyber risk management among financial\ninstitutions.\n\nWe also are, or may become, subject to\ncontinuously evolving and developing laws and\nregulations in other jurisdictions regarding\nprivacy, data protection and data security.\nFor example, in Canada we are subject to the\nPersonal Information Protection and Electronic\nDocuments Act (\u201cPIPEDA\u201d) and may become\nsubject to additional privacy, data protection\nand data security laws and regulations in\nCanada, including those which may differ from\nPIPEDA, if passed.

We\nalso are subject to the U.K. General Data\nProtection Regulation (\u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d), which is\nhow the EU GDPR has been implemented into U.K.\nlaw. These laws and regulations, and similar\nlaws and regulations in other jurisdictions,\nimpose strict requirements regarding the\ncollection, storage, handling, use,\ndisclosure, transfer, security and other\nprocessing of personal information, which may\nhave adverse consequences, including\nsignificant compliance costs and severe\nmonetary penalties for non-compliance.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as privacy,\ndata protection, and data security laws may be\ninterpreted and applied differently from\ncountry to country and may create inconsistent\nor conflicting requirements.\n\nFurther, we make public statements about our\nuse, collection, disclosure and other\nprocessing of personal information through our\nprivacy policies, information provided on our\nwebsite and press statements. Although we\nendeavor to comply with our public statements\nand documentation, we may at times fail to do\nso or be alleged to have failed to do so. The\npublication of our privacy policies and other\nstatements that provide promises and\nassurances about privacy, data protection and\ndata security can subject us to potential\ngovernment or legal action if they are found\nto be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative\nof our actual practices. Additional risks\ncould arise in connection with any failure or\nperceived failure by us, our service providers\nor other third parties with which we do\nbusiness to provide adequate disclosure or\ntransparency to individuals, including our\ncustomers, about the personal information\ncollected from them and its use, to receive,\ndocument or honor the privacy preferences\nexpressed by individuals, to protect personal\ninformation from unauthorized disclosure, or\nto maintain proper training on privacy\npractices for all employees or third parties\nwho have access to personal information in our\npossession or control.\n\nOur efforts to comply with GLBA, FCRA, CPRA,\nPIPEDA, EU GDPR, U.K. GDPR and other privacy,\ndata protection and data security laws and\nregulations, as well as our posted privacy\npolicies, and related contractual obligations\nto third parties, entail substantial expenses,\nmay divert resources from other initiatives\nand projects, and could limit the services we\nare able to offer. Furthermore, enforcement\nactions and investigations by regulatory\nauthorities related to data security incidents\nand privacy, data protection and data security\nviolations continue to increase. The enactment\nof more restrictive laws or regulations, or\nfuture enforcement actions, litigation or\ninvestigations, could impact us through\nincreased costs or restrictions on our\nbusiness, and any noncompliance or perceived\nnoncompliance could result in monetary or\nother penalties, harm to our reputation,\ndistraction to our management and technical\npersonnel and significant legal liability.\n\nOur businesses are subject to the risk of\nincreased litigation, government\ninvestigations and regulatory enforcement.\n\nOur businesses are subject to increased\nlitigation, government investigations and\nother regulatory enforcement risks as a result\nof a number of factors and from various\nsources, including the highly regulated nature\nof the financial services industry, the focus\nof state and federal prosecutors on banks and\nthe financial services industry and the\nstructure of the credit card industry.\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainties involved in\nlitigation, government investigations and\nregulatory enforcement decisions, and the very\nlarge or indeterminate damages sought in some\nmatters asserted against us, there can be\nsignificant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these kinds of\nmatters. The finding, or even the assertion,\nof substantial legal liability against us\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial condition and could\ncause significant reputational harm to us,\nwhich could seriously harm our business. For\nexample, the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident has\nresulted in litigation, consent orders,\nsettlements, government investigations and\nother regulatory enforcement inquiries.\n\nIn addition, financial institutions, such as\nourselves, face significant regulatory\nscrutiny, which can lead to public enforcement\nactions or nonpublic supervisory actions. We\nand our subsidiaries are subject to\ncomprehensive regulation and periodic\nexamination by, among other regulatory bodies,\nthe Federal Banking Agencies, SEC, CFTC and\nCFPB. We have been subject to enforcement\nactions by many of these and other regulators\nand may continue to be involved in such\nactions, including governmental inquiries,\ninvestigations and enforcement proceedings,\nincluding by the OCC, Department of Justice,\nthe FinCEN and state Attorneys General.\n\nOver the last several years, federal and state\nregulators have focused on risk management,\ncompliance with anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d)\nand sanctions laws, privacy, data protection\nand data security, use of service providers,\nfair lending and other consumer protection\nissues and innovative activities, such as\nthose that utilize new technology. In August\n2020, we entered into consent orders with the\nFederal Reserve and the OCC resulting from\nregulatory reviews of the 2019 Cybersecurity\nIncident and relating to ongoing enhancements\nof our cybersecurity and operational risk\nmanagement processes, and we paid a civil\nmonetary penalty as part of the OCC agreement.\nThe OCC and the Federal Reserve have since\nterminated their consent orders. In January\n2021, we also paid a civil monetary penalty\nassessed by FinCEN against the Bank in\nconnection with AML\n                                              \n  35    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nviolations alleged to have occurred between\n2008 and 2014. Regulatory scrutiny is expected\nto continue in these areas, including as a\nresult of implementation of the AML Act of\n2020.\n\nWe expect that regulators and governmental\nenforcement bodies will continue taking public\nenforcement actions against financial\ninstitutions in addition to addressing\nsupervisory concerns through nonpublic\nsupervisory actions or findings, which could\ninvolve restrictions on our activities, or our\nability to make acquisitions or otherwise\nexpand our business, among other limitations\nthat could adversely affect our business. In\naddition, a violation of law or regulation by\nanother financial institution is likely to\ngive rise to an investigation by regulators\nand other governmental agencies of the same or\nsimilar practices by us. Furthermore, a single\nevent may give rise to numerous and\noverlapping investigations and proceedings.\nThese and other initiatives from governmental\nauthorities and officials may subject us to\nfurther judgments, settlements, fines or\npenalties, or cause us to restructure our\noperations and activities or to cease offering\ncertain products or services, all of which\ncould harm our reputation or lead to higher\noperational costs. Litigation, government\ninvestigations and other regulatory actions\ncould generally subject us to significant\nfines, increased expenses, restrictions on our\nactivities and damage to our reputation and\nour brand, and could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations. For additional information\nregarding legal and regulatory proceedings to\nwhich we are subject, see \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u2014Note 18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies,\nGuarantees and Others.\u201d\n                                              \n   Other Business Risks                       \n                                              \nWe face intense competition in all of our\nmarkets, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and results of\noperations.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment\nacross all of our lines of business, whether\nin making loans, attracting deposits or in the\nglobal payments industry, and we expect\ncompetitive conditions to continue to\nintensify with respect to most of our products\nparticularly in our credit card and consumer\nbanking businesses. We compete on the basis of\nthe rates we pay on deposits and the rates and\nother terms we charge on the loans we\noriginate or purchase, as well as the quality\nand range of our customer service, products,\ninnovation and experience. This competitive\nenvironment is primarily a result of changes\nin technology, product delivery systems and\nregulation, as well as the emergence of new or\nsignificantly larger financial services\nproviders, all of which may affect our\ncustomers\u2019 expectations and demands. In\naddition to offering competitive products and\nservices, we invest in and conduct marketing\ncampaigns to attract and inform customers. If\nour marketing campaigns are unsuccessful, it\nmay adversely impact our ability to attract\nnew customers and grow market share.\n\nSome of our competitors, including new and\nemerging competitors in the digital and mobile\npayments space and other financial technology\nproviders, are not subject to the same\nregulatory requirements or scrutiny to which\nwe are subject, which also could place us at a\ncompetitive disadvantage, in particular in the\ndevelopment of new technology platforms or the\nability to rapidly innovate. We compete with\nmany forms of payments offered by both bank\nand non-bank providers, including a variety of\nnew and evolving alternative payment\nmechanisms, systems and products, such as\naggregators and web-based and wireless payment\nplatforms or technologies, digital or\ncryptocurrencies, prepaid systems and payment\nservices targeting users of social networks,\ncommunications platforms and online gaming. If\nwe are unable to continue to keep pace with\ninnovation, do not effectively market our\nproducts and services or are prohibited from\nor unwilling to enter emerging areas of\ncompetition, our business and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. In\naddition, government actions or initiatives\nmay also provide competitors with increased\nopportunities to derive competitive advantages\nand may create new competitors. For example,\nthe CFPB has proposed a rule that would\nrequire certain financial institutions,\nincluding the Company, to share certain\nfinancial information with third parties upon\na customer\u2019s request, which could enable those\nthird parties to offer competing financial\nservices to consumers.\n\nSome of our competitors are substantially\nlarger than we are, which may give those\ncompetitors advantages, including a more\ndiversified product and customer base, the\nability to reach more customers and potential\ncustomers, operational efficiencies, broad-\nbased local distribution capabilities, lower-\ncost funding and larger existing branch\nnetworks. Many of our competitors are also\nfocusing on cross-selling their products and\ndeveloping new products or technologies, which\ncould affect our ability to maintain or grow\nexisting customer relationships or require us\nto offer lower interest rates or fees on our\nlending products or higher interest rates on\ndeposits. Competition for loans could result\nin origination of fewer loans, earning less on\nour loans or an increase in loans that perform\nbelow expectations.\n\nWe operate as an online direct bank in the\nUnited States. While direct banking provides a\nsignificant opportunity to attract new\ncustomers that value greater and more flexible\naccess to banking services at reduced costs,\nwe face strong and increasing competition in\nthe direct banking market. Aggressive pricing\nthroughout the industry may adversely affect\nthe retention of existing balances and the\ncost-efficient acquisition of new deposit\nfunds and may affect our growth and\nprofitability. Customers\n                                              \n  36    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ncould also close their online accounts or\nreduce balances or deposits in favor of\nproducts and services offered by competitors\nfor other reasons. These shifts, which could\nbe rapid, could result from general\ndissatisfaction with our products or services,\nincluding concerns over pricing, online\nsecurity or our reputation. The potential\nconsequences of this competitive environment\nare exacerbated by the flexibility of direct\nbanking and the financial and technological\nsophistication of our online customer base.\n\nIn our credit card business, competition for\nrewards customers may result in higher rewards\nexpenses, or we may fail to attract new\ncustomers or retain existing rewards customers\ndue to increasing competition for these\nconsumers. As of December 31, 2023, we have a\nnumber of large partnerships in our credit\ncard loan portfolio. The market for key\nbusiness partners, especially in the credit\ncard business, is very competitive, and we may\nnot be able to grow or maintain these partner\nrelationships or assure that these\nrelationships will be profitable or valued by\nour customers. Additionally, partners\nthemselves may face changes in their business,\nincluding market factors and ownership\nchanges, that could impact the partnership. We\nface the risk that we could lose partner\nrelationships, even after we have invested\nsignificant resources into acquiring and\ndeveloping the relationships. The loss of any\nkey business partner could have a negative\nimpact on our results of operations, including\nlower returns, excess operating expense and\nexcess funding capacity.\n\nWe depend on our partners to effectively\npromote our co-brand and private label\nproducts and integrate the use of our credit\ncards into their retail operations. The\nfailure by our partners to effectively promote\nand support our products as well as changes\nthey may make in their business models could\nadversely affect card usage and our ability to\nachieve the growth and profitability\nobjectives of our partnerships. In addition,\nif our partners do not adhere to the terms of\nour program agreements and standards, or\notherwise diminish the value of our brand, we\nmay suffer reputational damage and customers\nmay be less likely to use our products.\n\nSome of our competitors have developed, or may\ndevelop, substantially greater financial and\nother resources than we have, may offer richer\nvalue propositions or a wider range of\nprograms and services than we offer, or may\nuse more effective advertising, marketing or\ncross-selling strategies to acquire and retain\nmore customers, capture a greater share of\nspending and borrowings, attain and develop\nmore attractive co-brand card programs and\nmaintain greater merchant acceptance than we\nhave. We may not be able to compete\neffectively against these threats or respond\nor adapt to changes in consumer spending\nhabits as effectively as our competitors.\n\nIn such a competitive environment, we may lose\nentire accounts or may lose account balances\nto competing firms, or we may find it more\ncostly to maintain our existing customer base.\nCustomer attrition from any or all of our\nlending products, together with any lowering\nof interest rates or fees that we might\nimplement to retain customers, could reduce\nour revenues and therefore our earnings.\nSimilarly, unexpected customer attrition from\nour deposit products, in addition to an\nincrease in rates or services that we may\noffer to retain deposits, may increase our\nexpenses and therefore reduce our earnings.\n\nOur business, financial condition and results\nof operations may be adversely affected by\nmerchants\u2019 efforts to reduce the fees charged\nby credit and debit card networks to\nfacilitate card transactions, and by\nlegislation and regulation impacting such\nfees.\n\nInterchange fees are the amounts established\nby credit and debit card networks for the\npurpose of compensating debit and credit card\nissuers for their role in facilitating card\ntransactions and are a meaningful source of\nrevenue for our credit and debit card\nbusinesses. Interchange fees are a revenue\nsource that, for example, covers the issuer\u2019s\ncosts associated with credit and debit card\npayments, fund rewards programs, offset fraud,\nmanagement and dispute costs and fund\ncompetition and innovation. Interchange fees\ncontinue to be the subject of significant and\nintense global legal, legislative and\nregulatory focus, and the resulting decisions,\nlegislation and regulation may have a material\nadverse impact on our overall business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nLegislative and regulatory bodies in a number\nof countries have sought, or are currently\nseeking, to reduce interchange fees through\nlegislation, competition-related regulatory\nproceedings, voluntary agreements, central\nbank regulation and/or litigation. For credit\ntransactions, interchange reimbursement rates\nin the United States are set by credit card\nnetworks such as MasterCard and Visa.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, such as Canada and\ncertain countries in Europe, including the\nU.K., interchange fees and related practices\nare subject to regulatory activity, including\nin some cases, imposing caps on permissible\ninterchange fees. Our international card\nbusinesses have been impacted by these\nrestrictions. For example, in the U.K.,\ninterchange fees are capped for both credit\nand debit card transactions. In addition, in\nCanada, Visa and MasterCard payment networks\nhave entered into voluntary\n                                              \n  37    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nagreements with the Department of Finance\nCanada to maintain an agreed upon average\ninterchange rate. Lowering interchange fees\nremains an area of domestic and international\ngovernmental attention by certain parties.\n\nIn addition to this regulatory activity,\nmerchants are also seeking avenues to reduce\ninterchange fees. Merchants and their trade\ngroups have filed numerous lawsuits against\npayment card networks and banks that issue\ncards on those networks, claiming that their\npractices toward merchants, including\ninterchange fees, violate federal antitrust\nlaws. In 2005, a number of entities filed\nantitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa\nand several member banks, including our\nsubsidiaries and us, alleging among other\nthings, that the defendants conspired to fix\nthe level of interchange fees. For additional\ninformation about the lawsuits, see \u201cPart\nII\u2014Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\u2014Note 18\u2014Commitments,\nContingencies, Guarantees and Others\u201d for\nfurther details.\n\nSome major retailers or industry sectors could\nindependently negotiate lower interchange fees\nwith MasterCard and Visa, which could, in\nturn, result in lower interchange fees for us\nwhen our cardholders undertake purchase\ntransactions with these retailers. Merchants\ncontinue to lobby Congress aggressively for\nlegislation that would require additional\nrouting requirements for credit cards that are\nissued on four-party networks, like Visa or\nMasterCard, which could create a downward\npressure on interchange fees should their\nefforts be successful. Retailers may continue\nto bring legal proceedings against us or other\ncredit card and debit card issuers and\nnetworks in the future.\n\nFor debit transactions, Regulation II (Debit\nCard Interchange Fees and Routing) which was\nissued by the Federal Reserve in 2011, place\nlimits on the interchange fees we may charge\nand requires additional routing requirements\nfor debit cards issued on four-party networks,\nlike Visa or Mastercard. On October 25, 2023,\nthe Federal Reserve released a notice of\nproposed rulemaking to revise Regulation II to\nfurther reduce the interchange fee cap that\ndebit card issuers covered by Regulation II\ncan receive for debit card transactions. For\nmore information on these rules, please see\n\u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\n\nBeyond pursuing litigation, legislation and\nregulation, merchants may also promote forms\nof payment with lower fees or seek to impose\nsurcharges or discounts at the point of sale\nfor use of credit or debit cards. New payment\nsystems, particularly mobile-based payment\ntechnologies, could also gain widespread\nadoption and lead to issuer transaction fees\nor the displacement of credit or debit cards\nas a payment method.\n\nThe heightened focus by merchants and\nlegislative and regulatory bodies on the fees\ncharged by credit and debit card networks, and\nthe ability of certain merchants to\nsuccessfully negotiate discounts to\ninterchange fees with MasterCard and Visa or\ndevelop alternative payment systems, could\nresult in a loss of income. Any resulting loss\nin income to us could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\n\nIf we are not able to invest successfully in\nand introduce digital and other technological\ndevelopments across all our businesses, our\nfinancial performance may suffer.\n\nOur industry is subject to rapid and\nsignificant technological changes and our\nability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and\nexpectations is key to our ability to grow\nrevenue and earnings. We expect digital\ntechnologies to continue to have a significant\nimpact on banking over time. Consumers expect\nrobust digital experiences from their\nfinancial services providers. The ability for\ncustomers to access their accounts and conduct\nfinancial transactions using digital\ntechnology, including mobile applications, is\nan important aspect of the financial services\nindustry and financial institutions are\nrapidly introducing new digital and other\ntechnology-driven products and services that\naim to offer a better customer experience and\nto reduce costs. We continue to invest in\ndigital technology designed to attract new\ncustomers, facilitate the ability of existing\ncustomers to conduct financial transactions\nand enhance the customer experience related to\nour products and services.\n\nOur continued success depends, in part, upon\nour ability to assess and address the needs of\nour customers by using digital technology to\nprovide products and services that meet their\nexpectations. The development and launch of\nnew digital products and services depends in\nlarge part on our ability to invest in and\nbuild the technology platforms that can enable\nthem, in a cost effective and timely manner.\nWe expect that new technologies in the\npayments industry will continue to emerge, and\nthese new technologies may be superior to our\nexisting technology. See \u201c We face intense\ncompetition in all of our markets \u201d and \u201c We\nface risks related to our operational,\ntechnological and organizational\ninfrastructure. \u201d\n\nSome of our competitors are substantially\nlarger than we are, which may allow those\ncompetitors to invest more money into their\ntechnology infrastructure and digital\ninnovation than we do. In addition, smaller\ncompetitors may experience lower cost\nstructures and different regulatory\nrequirements and scrutiny than we do, which\nmay allow them to innovate more rapidly than\nwe can. See \u201c We face intense competition in\nall of our markets. \u201d Further, our success\ndepends on our ability to attract and retain\n                                              \n  38    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nstrong digital and technology leaders,\nengineers and other specialized personnel. The\ncompetition is intense and the compensation\ncosts continue to increase for such talent. If\nwe are unable to attract and retain digital\nand technology talent, our ability to offer\ndigital products and services and build the\nnecessary technology infrastructure could be\nnegatively affected, which could negatively\nimpact our business and financial results. A\nfailure to maintain or enhance our competitive\nposition with respect to digital products and\nservices, whether because we fail to\nanticipate customer expectations or because\nour technological developments fail to perform\nas desired or are not implemented in a timely\nor successful manner, could negatively impact\nour business and financial results.\n\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of our mergers, acquisitions and\nstrategic partnerships.\n\nWe engage in merger and acquisition activity\nand enter into strategic partnerships from\ntime to time. We continue to evaluate and\nanticipate engaging in, among other merger and\nacquisition activity, additional strategic\npartnerships and selected acquisitions of\nfinancial institutions and other businesses or\nassets, including credit card and other loan\nportfolios. We may not be able to identify and\nsecure future acquisition targets on terms and\nconditions that are acceptable to us, or\nsuccessfully complete and integrate the\nbusinesses within the anticipated time frame\nand achieve the anticipated benefits of\nproposed mergers, acquisitions and strategic\npartnerships, which could impair our growth.\n\nAny merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership we undertake entails certain\nrisks, which may materially and adversely\naffect our results of operations. If we\nexperience greater than anticipated costs to\nintegrate acquired businesses into our\nexisting operations, or are not able to\nachieve the anticipated benefits of any\nmerger, acquisition or strategic partnership,\nincluding cost savings and other synergies,\nour business could be negatively affected. In\naddition, it is possible that the ongoing\nintegration processes could result in the loss\nof key employees, errors or delays in systems\nimplementation, exposure to cybersecurity\nrisks associated with acquired businesses,\nexposure to additional regulatory oversight,\nthe disruption of our ongoing businesses or\ninconsistencies in standards, controls,\nprocedures and policies that adversely affect\nour ability to maintain relationships with\npartners, clients, customers, depositors and\nemployees or to achieve the anticipated\nbenefits of any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership. Integration efforts\nalso may divert management attention and\nresources. These integration matters may have\nan adverse effect on us during any transition\nperiod.\n\nSee additional risk factors under the heading\n\u201cRisks Relating to the Acquisition of\nDiscover.\u201d\n\nIn addition, we may face the following risks\nin connection with any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership:\n\n\u2022 New Businesses and Geographic or Other\nMarkets: Our merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership activity may involve our entry\ninto new businesses or new geographic areas or\nmarkets in the U.S. or internationally, that\npresent risks resulting from our relative\ninexperience in these new businesses,\nlocalities or markets. These new businesses,\nlocalities or markets may change the overall\ncharacter of our consolidated portfolio of\nbusinesses and alter our exposure to economic\nand other external factors. We also face the\nrisk that we will not be successful in these\nnew businesses, localities or markets.\n\n\u2022 Identification and Assessment of Merger and\nAcquisition Targets and Deployment of Acquired\nAssets: We may not be able to identify,\nacquire or partner with suitable targets.\nFurther, our ability to achieve the\nanticipated benefits of any merger,\nacquisition or strategic partnership will\ndepend on our ability to assess the asset\nquality, risks and value of the particular\nassets or institutions we partner with, merge\nwith or acquire. We may be unable to\nprofitably deploy any assets we acquire.\n\n\u2022 Accuracy of Assumptions: In connection with\nany merger, acquisition or strategic\npartnership, we may make certain assumptions\nrelating to the proposed merger, acquisition\nor strategic partnership that may be, or may\nprove to be, inaccurate, including as a result\nof the failure to anticipate the costs,\ntimeline or ability to realize the expected\nbenefits of any merger, acquisition or\nstrategic partnership. The inaccuracy of any\nassumptions we may make could result in\nunanticipated consequences that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of\noperations or financial condition.\n\n\u2022 Target-specific Risk: Assets and companies\nthat we acquire, or companies that we enter\ninto strategic partnerships with, will have\ntheir own risks that are specific to a\nparticular asset or company. These risks\ninclude, but are not limited to, particular or\nspecific regulatory, accounting, operational,\nreputational and industry risks, any of which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations or financial condition.\nFor example, we may face challenges associated\nwith integrating other companies due to\ndifferences in corporate culture, compliance\nsystems or standards of\n                                              \n  39    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nconduct. Indemnification rights, if any, may\nbe insufficient to compensate us for any\nlosses or damages resulting from such risks.\nIn addition to regulatory approvals discussed\nbelow, certain of our merger, acquisition or\npartnership activity may require third-party\nconsents in order for us to fully realize the\nanticipated benefits of any such transaction.\n\n\u2022 Conditions to Regulatory Approval: We may be\nrequired to obtain various governmental and\nregulatory approvals to consummate certain\nacquisitions. We cannot be certain whether,\nwhen or on what terms and conditions, such\napprovals may be granted. Consequently, we may\nnot obtain governmental or regulatory approval\nfor a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms\nor at all, in which case we would not be able\nto complete the acquisition despite investing\nresources in pursuing it.\n\nReputational risk and social factors may\nimpact our results and damage our brand.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers is\nhighly dependent upon the perceptions of\nconsumer and commercial borrowers and deposit\nholders and other external perceptions of our\nproducts, services, trustworthiness, business\npractices, workplace culture, compliance\npractices or our financial health. Capital\nOne\u2019s brand is one of our most important\nassets. Maintaining and enhancing our brand\ndepends largely on our ability to continue to\nprovide high-quality products and services.\nAdverse perceptions regarding our reputation\nin the consumer, commercial, and funding\nmarkets could lead to difficulties in\ngenerating, maintaining and financing\naccounts. In particular, negative public\nperceptions regarding our reputation,\nincluding negative perceptions regarding our\nability to maintain the security of our\ntechnology systems and protect customer data,\ncould lead to decreases in the levels of\ndeposits that current and potential consumer\nand commercial customers choose to maintain\nwith us. Negative perceptions may also\nsignificantly increase the costs of attracting\nand retaining customers. In addition, negative\nperceptions regarding certain industries,\npartners or clients could also prompt us to\ncease business activities associated with\nthose entities in order to manage reputational\nrisk.\n\nNegative public opinion or damage to our brand\ncould also result from actual or alleged\nconduct in any number of activities or\ncircumstances, including lending practices,\nregulatory compliance, cyber-attacks or other\nsecurity incidents, corporate governance and\nsales and marketing, and from actions taken by\nregulators or other persons in response to\nsuch conduct. Such conduct could fall short of\nour customers\u2019 and the public\u2019s heightened\nexpectations of companies of our size with\nrigorous privacy, data protection, data\nsecurity and compliance practices, and could\nfurther harm our reputation. In addition, our\nco-brand and private label credit card\npartners or other third parties with whom we\nhave important relationships may take actions\nover which we have limited control that could\nnegatively impact perceptions about us or the\nfinancial services industry. The proliferation\nof social media may increase the likelihood\nthat negative public opinion from any of the\nactual or alleged events discussed above could\nimpact our reputation and business.\n\nIn addition, a variety of economic or social\nfactors may cause changes in borrowing\nactivity, including credit card use, payment\npatterns and the rate of defaults by account\nholders and borrowers domestically and\ninternationally. These economic and social\nfactors include changes in consumer confidence\nlevels, the public\u2019s perception regarding the\nbanking industry and consumer debt, including\ncredit card use, and changing attitudes about\nthe stigma of bankruptcy. If consumers develop\nor maintain negative attitudes about incurring\ndebt, or consumption trends decline or if we\nfail to maintain and enhance our brand, or we\nincur significant expenses to do so, our\nreputation and business and financial results\ncould be materially and negatively affected.\n\nThere has also been an increased focus by\ninvestor advocacy groups, investment funds and\nshareholder activists, among others, on topics\nrelated to environmental, social and corporate\ngovernance policies, and our policies,\npractices and disclosure in these areas,\nincluding those related to climate change.\nReputation risk related to corporate policies\nand practices on environmental, social and\ncorporate governance topics is increasingly\ncomplex. Divergent ideological and social\nviews may create competing stakeholder,\nlegislative, and regulatory scrutiny that may\nimpact our reputation. Furthermore, responding\nto environmental, social and corporate\ngovernance considerations and implementing our\nrelated goals and initiatives involve risk and\nuncertainties, require investments and depend\nin part on third-party performance or data\nthat is outside of our control. There can be\nno assurance that we will achieve these goals\nand initiatives or that any such achievements\nwill have the desired results. Our failure to\nachieve progress in these areas on a timely\nbasis, if at all, could impact our reputation\nand public perceptions of our business.\n\nIf we are not able to protect our intellectual\nproperty, our revenue and profitability could\nbe negatively affected.\n\nWe rely on a variety of measures to protect\nand enhance our intellectual property,\nincluding copyrights, trademarks, trade\nsecrets, patents and certain restrictions on\ndisclosure, solicitation and competition. We\nalso undertake other measures to control\naccess to and distribution of our other\nproprietary and confidential information.\nThese measures may not prevent\n                                              \n  40    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nmisappropriation of our proprietary or\nconfidential information or infringement,\nmisappropriation or other violations of our\nintellectual property rights and a resulting\nloss of competitive advantage. In addition,\nour competitors or other third parties may\nobtain patents for innovations that are used\nin our industry or allege that our systems,\nprocesses or technologies infringe,\nmisappropriate or violate their intellectual\nproperty rights. Given the complex, rapidly\nchanging and competitive technological and\nbusiness environments in which we operate, if\nour competitors or other third parties are\nsuccessful in obtaining such patents or\nprevail in intellectual property-related\nlitigation against us, we could lose\nsignificant revenues, incur significant\nlicense, royalty, technology development or\nother expenses, or pay significant damages.\n\nOur risk management strategies may not be\nfully effective in mitigating our risk\nexposures in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk.\n\nManagement of market, credit, liquidity,\nstrategic, reputational, operational and\ncompliance risk requires, among other things,\npolicies and procedures to properly record and\nverify a large number of transactions and\nevents. See \u201cPart II\u2014Item 7. MD&A\u2014Risk\nManagement\u201d for further details. Our Framework\nis designed to identify, measure, assess,\nmonitor, test, control, report, escalate, and\nmitigate the risks that we face. Even though\nwe continue to devote significant resources to\ndeveloping and operating our Framework, our\nrisk management strategies may not be fully\neffective in identifying and mitigating our\nrisk exposure in all market environments or\nagainst all types of risk, including risks\nthat are unidentified or unanticipated.\n\nSome of our methods of managing these risks\nare based upon our use of observed historical\nmarket behavior, the use of analytical and/or\nforecasting models and management\u2019s judgment.\nThese methods may not accurately predict\nfuture exposures, which could be significantly\ngreater than the historical measures or models\nindicate and market conditions, particularly\nduring a period of financial market stress,\ncan involve unprecedented dislocations. For\nexample, credit risk is inherent in the\nfinancial services business and results from,\namong other things, extending credit to\ncustomers. Our ability to assess the\ncreditworthiness of our customers may be\nimpaired if the models and approaches we use\nto select, manage and underwrite our consumer\nand commercial customers become less\npredictive of future charge-offs due, for\nexample, to rapid changes in the economy, or\ndegradation in the predictive nature of credit\nbureau and other data used in underwriting.\n\nWhile we employ a broad and diversified set of\nrisk monitoring and risk mitigation\ntechniques, those techniques and the judgments\nthat accompany their application cannot\nanticipate every economic and financial\noutcome or the timing of such outcomes. For\nexample, our ability to implement our risk\nmanagement strategies may be hindered by\nadverse changes in the volatility or liquidity\nconditions in certain markets and as a result,\nmay limit our ability to distribute such risks\n(for instance, when we seek to syndicate\nexposure in bridge financing transactions we\nhave underwritten). We may, therefore, incur\nlosses in the course of our risk management or\ninvesting activities.\n\nOur business could be negatively affected if\nwe are unable to attract, develop, retain and\nmotivate key senior leaders and skilled\nemployees.\n\nOur success depends, in large part, on our\nability to retain key senior leaders and to\nattract, develop and retain skilled employees,\nparticularly employees with advanced expertise\nin credit, risk, digital and technology\nskills. We depend on our senior leaders and\nskilled employees to oversee simultaneous,\ntransformative initiatives across the\nenterprise and execute on our business plans\nin an efficient and effective manner.\nCompetition for such senior leaders and\nemployees, and the costs associated with\nattracting, developing and retaining them, is\nhigh and competitive. While we engage in\nrobust succession planning, our key senior\nleaders have deep and broad industry\nexperience and could be difficult to replace\nwithout some degree of disruption.\n\nOur ability to attract, develop and retain\nqualified employees also is affected by\nperceptions of our culture and management,\nincluding our position on remote and hybrid\nwork arrangements, our profile in the regions\nwhere we have offices and the professional\nopportunities we offer. In addition, an\nincrease in remote working arrangements by\nother companies may create more job\nopportunities for employees and make it more\ndifficult for us to attract and retain key\ntalent.\n\nRegulation or regulatory guidance restricting\nexecutive compensation, as well as evolving\ninvestor expectations, may limit the types of\ncompensation arrangements that we may enter\ninto with our most senior leaders and could\nhave a negative impact on our ability to\nattract, retain and motivate such leaders in\nsupport of our long-term strategy. These laws\nand regulations may not apply in the same\nmanner to all financial institutions and\ntechnology companies, which therefore may\nsubject us to more restrictions than other\ninstitutions and companies with which we\ncompete for talent and may also hinder our\nability to compete for talent with other\nindustries. We rely upon our senior leaders\nnot only for business success, but also to\nlead with integrity. To the extent our senior\nleaders behave in a manner that does not\ncomport with our values, the consequences to\nour brand and reputation could be severe and\ncould adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations. If we are unable to\nattract, develop and retain talented senior\nleadership and employees, or to implement\nappropriate succession plans for our senior\nleadership, our business could be negatively\naffected.\n                                              \n  41    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  We face risks from catastrophic events.     \n                                              \nNatural disasters, geopolitical events and\nother catastrophic events could harm our\nemployees, business and infrastructure,\nincluding our information technology systems\nand third-party platforms. Our ability to\nconduct business may be adversely affected by\na disruption in the infrastructure that\nsupports our business and the communities\nwhere we are located, which are concentrated\nin the Northern Virginia and New York\nmetropolitan areas, Richmond, Virginia and\nPlano, Texas. This may include a disruption\ninvolving damage or loss of access to a\nphysical site, cyber-attacks and other\nsecurity incidents, terrorist activities, the\noccurrence or worsening of disease outbreaks\nor pandemics, natural disasters, extreme\nweather events, electrical outage,\nenvironmental hazards, disruption to\ntechnological infrastructure, communications\nor other services we use, our employees or\nthird parties with whom we conduct business.\nOur business, financial condition and results\nof operations may be impacted by any such\ndisruption and our ability to implement\ncorresponding response measures quickly. In\naddition, if a natural disaster or other\ncatastrophic event occurs in certain regions\nwhere our business, customers or assets\nsecuring our loans are concentrated, such as\nthe mid-Atlantic, New York, California or\nTexas metropolitan areas, or in regions where\nour third-party platforms are located, we\ncould be disproportionately impacted as\ncompared to our competitors. The impact of\nsuch events and other catastrophes on the\noverall economy and our physical and\ntransition risks may also adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\nClimate change manifesting as physical or\ntransition risks could adversely affect our\nbusinesses, operations and customers and\nresult in increased costs.\n\nClimate change risks can manifest as physical\nor transition risks.\n\nPhysical risks are the risks from the effects\nof climate change arising from acute, climate-\nrelated events, such as, hurricanes, flooding\nand wildfires, and chronic shifts in climate,\nsuch as sea level rise and higher average\ntemperatures. Such events could lead to\nfinancial losses or disrupt our operations or\nthose of our customers or third parties on\nwhich we rely, including through direct damage\nto assets and indirect impacts from supply\nchain disruption and market volatility.\n\nTransition risks are the risks resulting from\nthe shift toward a lower-carbon economy\narising from the changes in policy, consumer\nand business sentiment or technologies in\nregards to limiting climate change. Transition\nrisks, including changes in consumer\npreferences and additional regulatory\nrequirements or taxes, could increase our\nexpenses, affect credit performance, and\nimpact our strategies or those of our\ncustomers. For example, on October 24, 2023,\nthe Federal Banking Agencies jointly issued\nguidance on climate-related financial risk\nmanagement for large institutions, which\napplies to us. For more information on\nclimate-related regulatory developments, see\n\u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\n\nPhysical and transition risks could also\naffect the financial health of certain\ncustomers in impacted industries or\ngeographies. In addition, we face reputational\nrisk as a result of our policies, practices,\ndisclosures and decisions related to climate\nchange and the environment, or the practices\nor involvement of our clients or vendors and\nsuppliers, in certain industries or projects\nassociated with causing or exacerbating\nclimate change. Further, there is increased\nscrutiny of climate change-related policies,\ngoals and disclosures, which could result in\nlitigation and regulatory investigations and\nactions. We may incur additional costs and\nrequire additional resources as we evolve our\nstrategy, practices and related disclosures\nwith respect to these matters.\n\nAs climate risk is interconnected with many\nrisk types, we continue to enhance processes\nto embed evolving climate risk considerations\ninto our existing risk management strategies;\nhowever, because the timing and severity of\nclimate change may not be predictable, our\nrisk management strategies may not be\neffective in mitigating climate risk exposure.\n\nWe face risks from the use of or changes to\nassumptions or estimates in our financial\nstatements.\n\nPursuant to generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we are\nrequired to use certain assumptions and\nestimates in preparing our financial\nstatements, including determining our\nallowance for credit losses, the fair value of\ncertain assets and liabilities, and goodwill\nimpairment, among other items. In addition,\nthe FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies\nmay change the financial accounting and\nreporting standards, including those related\nto assumptions and estimates we use to prepare\nour financial statements, in ways that we\ncannot predict and that could impact our\nfinancial statements. If actual results differ\nfrom the assumptions or estimates underlying\nour financial statements or if financial\naccounting and reporting standards are\nchanged, we may experience unexpected material\nlosses. For a discussion of our use of\nestimates in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements, see \u201cPart\nII\u2014Item 7. MD&A\u2014Critical Accounting Policies\nand Estimates\u201d and \u201cPart II\u2014Item 8.

Financial\nservices institutions are interrelated as a\nresult of trading, clearing, servicing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. We have\nexposure to financial institutions,\nintermediaries and counterparties that are\nexposed to risks over which we have little or\nno control.\n\nRecently, several financial services\ninstitutions have failed or required outside\nliquidity support, in many cases, as a result\nof the inability of the institutions to obtain\nneeded liquidity. For example, during 2023,\nSilicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First\nRepublic Bank were closed and placed under\nFDIC receivership. This has led to additional\nrisk for other financial services institutions\nand the financial services industry generally\nas a result of increased lack of confidence in\nthe financial sector. The failure of other\nbanks and financial institutions and the\nmeasures taken by governments, businesses and\nother organizations in response to these\nevents could adversely impact our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nFor information on the FDIC\u2019s special\nassessment following the closures of Silicon\nValley Bank and Signature Bank, see \u201cItem 1.\nBusiness\u2014Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\n\nIn addition, we routinely execute transactions\nwith counterparties in the financial services\nindustry, including brokers and dealers,\ncommercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds and other institutional clients,\nresulting in a significant credit\nconcentration with respect to the financial\nservices industry overall. As a result,\ndefaults by, or even rumors or questions\nabout, one or more financial services\ninstitutions, or the financial services\nindustry generally, have led to market-wide\nliquidity problems and could lead to losses or\ndefaults by us or by other institutions.\n\nLikewise, adverse developments affecting the\noverall strength and soundness of our\ncompetitors, the financial services industry\nas a whole and the general economic climate\nand the U.S. Treasury market could have a\nnegative impact on perceptions about the\nstrength and soundness of our business even if\nwe are not subject to the same adverse\ndevelopments. In addition, adverse\ndevelopments with respect to third parties\nwith whom we have important relationships also\ncould negatively impact perceptions about us.\nThese perceptions about us could cause our\nbusiness to be negatively affected and\nexacerbate the other risks that we face.\nMoreover, the speed with which information\nspreads through social media, enhanced\ntechnology and other news sources on the\nInternet and the ease with which customers\ntransact may amplify the onset and negative\neffects from such perceptions.\n\u256d\u2500 \u2022 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\u2502                                            \u2502\n\u2502  Item 1B.

While\nno organization can eliminate cybersecurity\nand information technology risk entirely, we\ndevote significant resources to a\ncybersecurity program designed to mitigate\nsuch risks.\n\nWe manage cybersecurity and technology risk at\nthe enterprise level according to our\nFramework, as described in more detail under\n\u201cPart II\u2014Item 7. MD&A\u2014Risk Management\u201d in this\nReport, which uses a three lines of defense\nmodel. Our cybersecurity risks are managed\nprogrammatically under the \u201coperational risk\u201d\ncategory of our Framework. Through this\nFramework, we establish practices for\nassessing our risk posture and executing key\ncontrols for cybersecurity and technology\nrisk, data management, and oversight of third\nparties with which we do business.\n\nThese operational risks are managed within a\ngovernance structure that consists of defined\nroles and responsibilities, formal governance\nbodies, and processes, policies and standards.\n\nOur policies and procedures define an overall,\nenterprise-wide approach for managing\ninformation security and technology risk. They\nestablish the following process to identify,\nassess and manage such risks across our three\nlines of defense:\n\n1. Identification: We evaluate the activities\nof our lines of business on a regular basis to\nidentify potential technology risk, including\ncybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.\nThis process takes into account the changing\nbusiness environment, the technology and cyber\nthreat landscape, and the objectives of the\nline of business being assessed.\n                                              \n  43    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\n2. Assessment, Measurement and Response:\nManagement assesses identified risks to\nestimate such risk\u2019s potential severity and\nthe likelihood of occurrence. Once a risk is\nidentified and measured, management determines\nthe appropriate response, including\ndetermining whether to accept the risk in\naccordance with our established risk appetite,\nor alternatively to implement new controls,\nenhance existing controls, and/or develop\nadditional mitigation strategies to reduce the\nimpact of the risk.\n\n3. Monitoring and Testing: Management is\nrequired to evaluate the effectiveness of risk\nmanagement practices and controls through\nmonitoring of key risk indicator metrics,\ntesting and other activities. Identified\nissues are remediated, addressed via\nmitigation plans, or escalated, in line with\nour risk appetite.\n\n4. Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation:\nManagement collects and aggregates risks\nacross the Company in order to support\nstrategic decision-making and to measure\noverall risk performance against risk appetite\nmetrics. Management also establishes processes\ndesigned to escalate, report, and address\nrisks and deficiencies within different\nbusiness lines, according to the requirements\nof our policies. For additional information\nregarding the escalation of these risks to the\nBoard of Directors, see \u201cGovernance\u201d below.\n\nOur policies and procedures collectively help\nexecute a risk management approach that\naccounts for cybersecurity threats\nspecifically targeting us, as well as those\nthat may arise from our engagement with\nbusiness partners, customers, service\nproviders and other third parties. For\nexample, we have processes designed to oversee\nand identify material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats associated with our use of third-party\nservice providers. The procedures,\ncapabilities and processes established under\nour policies are subject to regular review by\nthe Chief Information Security Officer\n(\u201cCISO\u201d) and Chief Technology Risk Officer\n(\u201cCTRO\u201d). See \u201cGovernance\u201d below for more\ninformation.\n\nAs part of our cybersecurity program, we\nemploy a range of security mechanisms and\ncontrols throughout our technology\nenvironment, which include the use of tools\nand techniques to search for cybersecurity\nthreats and vulnerabilities, as well as\nprocesses designed to address such threats and\nvulnerabilities. We also engage a number of\nexternal service providers with additional\nknowledge and capabilities in cybersecurity\nthreat intelligence, detection, and response.\nIn addition, a range of cyber educational\ninitiatives are employed to promote best\npractices for protecting our information and\ndata, and reporting cyber threats and other\nrisks to corporate systems, data, and\nfacilities.\n\nWe also maintain an Enterprise Cyber Response\nPlan (\u201cECRP\u201d) for handling potential or actual\ncybersecurity events that could impact us and\nour personnel, data, systems and customers.\nThe ECRP defines the roles and\nresponsibilities of various teams,\nindividuals, and stakeholders in performing\nthis enterprise response, guides decision\nmaking for escalation and other actions, and\nhelps to plan follow-on actions designed to\nreduce the likelihood of similar events\u2019\nrecurrence in the future.\n\nWe do not believe that risks from\ncybersecurity threats, including as a result\nof any previous cybersecurity incidents, such\nas the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident, have\nmaterially affected our overall business\nstrategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.

Our interest-\nearning assets include loans, investment\nsecurities and other interest-earning assets,\nwhile our interest-bearing liabilities include\ninterest-bearing deposits, securitized debt\nobligations, senior and subordinated notes,\nother borrowings and other interest-bearing\nliabilities. Generally, we include in interest\nincome any past due fees, net of reversals, on\nloans that we deem collectible. Our net\ninterest margin, based on our consolidated\nresults, represents the difference between the\nyield on our interest-earning assets and the\ncost of our interest-bearing liabilities,\nincluding the notional impact of non-interest-\nbearing funding.

The\noperations of acquired businesses have been\nintegrated into or managed as a part of our\nexisting business segments. Certain activities\nthat are not part of a business segment are\nincluded in the Other category, such as the\nmanagement of our corporate investment\nportfolio and asset/liability positions\nperformed by our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group and any residual tax expense or\nbenefit beyond what is assessed to our\nbusiness segments in order to arrive at the\nconsolidated effective tax rate.\n\nThe results of our individual businesses,\nwhich we report on a continuing operations\nbasis, reflect the manner in which management\nevaluates performance and makes decisions\nabout funding our operations and allocating\nresources. We may periodically change our\nbusiness segments or reclassify business\nsegment results based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies and changes\nin organizational alignment. Our business\nsegment results are intended to reflect each\nsegment as if it were a stand-alone business.\nWe use an internal management and reporting\nprocess to derive our business segment\nresults. Our internal management and reporting\nprocess employs various allocation\nmethodologies, including funds transfer\npricing, to assign certain balance sheet\nassets, deposits and other liabilities and\ntheir related revenues and expenses directly\nor indirectly attributable to each business\nsegment. Total interest income and non-\ninterest income are directly attributable to\nthe segment in which they are reported. The\nnet interest income of each segment reflects\nthe results of our funds transfer pricing\nprocess, which is primarily based on a matched\nfunding concept that takes into consideration\nmarket interest rates. Our funds transfer\npricing process is managed by our centralized\nCorporate Treasury group and provides a funds\ncredit for sources of funds, such as deposits\ngenerated by our Consumer Banking and\nCommercial Banking businesses, and a charge\nfor the use of funds by each segment. The\nallocation is unique to each business segment\nand acquired business and is based on the\ncomposition of assets and liabilities. The\nfunds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk\ncharacteristics of assets and liabilities and\noff-balance sheet products. Periodically, the\nmethodology and assumptions utilized in the\nfunds transfer pricing process are adjusted to\nreflect economic conditions and other factors,\nwhich may impact the allocation of net\ninterest income to the business segments. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.\n\nWe refer to the business segment results\nderived from our internal management\naccounting and reporting process as our\n\u201cmanaged\u201d presentation, which differs in some\ncases from our reported results prepared based\non U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive\nauthoritative body of guidance for management\naccounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore,\nthe managed presentation of our business\nsegment results may not be comparable to\nsimilar information provided by other\nfinancial services companies. In addition, our\nindividual business segment results should not\nbe used as a substitute for comparable results\ndetermined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nWe summarize our business segment results for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021 and provide a comparative discussion of\nthese results for 2023 and 2022, as well as\nchanges in our financial condition and credit\nperformance metrics as of December 31, 2023\ncompared to December 31, 2022.

We provide a summary of our\nsignificant accounting policies under \u201cItem 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u2014Note 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies.\u201d\n\nWe have identified the following accounting\nestimates as critical because they require\nsignificant judgments and assumptions about\nhighly complex and inherently uncertain\nmatters and the use of reasonably different\nestimates and assumptions could have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations\nor financial condition. Our critical\naccounting policies and estimates are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Loan loss reserves\n\n\u2022 Goodwill\n\n\u2022 Fair value\n\n\u2022 Customer rewards reserve\nWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates\nand judgments on an ongoing basis and update\nthem as necessary, based on changing\nconditions.\n                                              \n  72    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Loan Loss Reserves                          \n                                              \nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\nthat represents management\u2019s current estimate\nof expected credit losses inherent in our\ncredit card, consumer banking and commercial\nbanking loans held for investment portfolios\nas of each balance sheet date. We also reserve\nfor the uncollectible portion of finance\ncharges and fees related to credit card loan\nreceivables in the allowance for credit losses\nconsistent with the methodology we use to\nestimate the allowance for credit losses on\nthe principal portion of our credit card loan\nreceivables. We also separately reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. We build our\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses, which is driven\nby charge-offs, changes in the allowance for\ncredit losses and changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments. The allowance\nfor credit losses was $15.3 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to $13.2 billion\nas of December 31, 2022.\n\nOur allowance for credit losses and reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments utilize\nmodels to derive a quantitative estimate of\ncredit losses that is supplemented with\nadditional qualitative considerations to\ncapture risks and uncertainties not included\nin the quantitative result. Our estimate of\nexpected credit losses, for all loan and\nunfunded lending commitments, includes a\nreasonable and supportable forecast period of\none year and then reverts over a one-year\nperiod to historical losses at each relevant\nloss component of the estimate. We use\nexternally produced consensus estimates as\ninputs for our forward-looking macroeconomic\nforecast and consider other forecasts and\nsources of uncertainty to develop the\nquantitative component. This quantitative\nresult is then supplemented qualitatively by\nmanagement for economic uncertainty, including\nthe consideration of alternative macroeconomic\nscenarios, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in the\nquantitative component. These adjustments\nrepresent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses.\n\nWe have an established process, using\nanalytical tools and management judgment, to\ndetermine our allowance for credit losses.\nSignificant management judgment is required to\ndetermine the relevant information and\nestimation methods used to arrive at our best\nestimate of lifetime credit losses.\nEstablishing the allowance on a quarterly\nbasis involves evaluating and forecasting both\ncredit and macroeconomic variables. The\nmacroeconomic forecast used to inform both\nquantitative and qualitative components of our\nallowance for credit losses estimate is\nsensitive to certain variables, such as the\nU.S. Unemployment Rate, and the U.S. Real\nGross Domestic Product (\u201cU.S. Real GDP\u201d)\nGrowth Rate assumptions. Our December 31, 2023\nallowance assumes that the quarterly average\nU.S. unemployment rate gradually increases to\napproximately 4.4% by the fourth quarter of\n2024 and annual U.S. Real GDP increases 1.0%\nin 2024.\n\nIn addition to macroeconomic factors, many\ncredit factors inform our allowance for credit\nlosses, including, but not limited to,\nhistorical loss and recovery experience,\nrecent trends in delinquencies and charge-\noffs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy\nfilings, the value of collateral underlying\nsecured loans, account seasoning, changes in\nour credit evaluation, underwriting and\ncollection management policies, seasonality,\ncredit bureau scores, current general economic\nconditions, changes in the legal and\nregulatory environment and uncertainties in\nforecasting and modeling techniques used in\nestimating our allowance for credit losses.\n\nWe have a governance framework supported by\nprocesses and controls intended to ensure that\nour estimate of the allowance for credit\nlosses is appropriate. Our governance\nframework provides for oversight of methods,\nmodels, qualitative adjustments, process\ncontrols and results. At least quarterly,\nrepresentatives from the Finance and Risk\nManagement organizations review and assess our\nallowance methodologies, key assumptions and\nthe appropriateness of the allowance for\ncredit losses. Groups independent of our\nestimation functions participate in the review\nand validation process. Tasks performed by\nthese groups include periodic review of the\nrationale for and quantification of inputs\nrequiring judgment as well as adjustments to\nresults.\n\nWe have model policies, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which govern\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for estimating\ncredit losses. The Model Risk Office validates\nall models and requires ongoing monitoring of\ntheir performance.\n\nIn addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses, on a quarterly basis, we review and\nassess our estimate of expected losses related\nto unfunded lending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable which are\ngenerally in our Commercial Banking business.\nThe factors impacting our assessment generally\nalign with those considered in our evaluation\nof the allowance for credit losses for the\nCommercial Banking business. The reserve for\nlosses on unfunded lending commitments is\nincluded in other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets and changes to it\nare recorded through the provision for credit\nlosses in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\n                                              \n  73    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nAlthough we examine a variety of externally\navailable data, as well as our internal loan\nperformance data, to determine our allowance\nfor credit losses and reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments, our estimation process is\nsubject to risks and uncertainties, including\na reliance on historical loss and trend\ninformation that may not be representative of\ncurrent conditions and indicative of future\nperformance as well as economic forecasts that\nmay not align with actual future economic\nconditions. Accordingly, our actual credit\nloss experience may not be in line with our\nexpectations.

We did not recognize any\ngoodwill impairment in 2023 or 2022. See \u201cItem\n8. Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u2014Note 6\u2014Goodwill and Other Intangible\nAssets\u201d for additional information.\n\nWe perform our goodwill impairment test\nannually on October 1 at a reporting unit\nlevel. We are also required to test goodwill\nfor impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-\nnot that an impairment may have occurred. An\nimpairment of a reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is\ndetermined based on the amount by which the\nreporting unit\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its\nfair value, limited to the amount of goodwill\nallocated to the reporting unit. We have four\nreporting units: Credit Card, Auto Finance,\nOther Consumer Banking, and Commercial\nBanking.\n\nFor the purpose of our goodwill impairment\ntesting, we calculate the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit using an allocated capital\napproach based on each reporting unit\u2019s\nspecific regulatory capital requirements,\neconomic capital requirements and underlying\nrisks. The carrying amount for a reporting\nunit is the sum of its respective capital\nrequirements, goodwill and other intangibles\nbalances. Consolidated stockholder\u2019s equity in\nexcess of the sum of all reporting units\ncapital requirements that is not identified\nfor future capital needs, such as dividends,\nshare buybacks, or other strategic\ninitiatives, is allocated to the reporting\nunits and the Other category and assumed to be\ndistributed to equity holders in future\nperiods.\n\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit\nis a subjective process that requires the use\nof estimates and the exercise of significant\njudgment. We calculate the fair value of our\nreporting units using a discounted cash flow\n(\u201cDCF\u201d) calculation, a form of the income\napproach. This DCF calculation uses projected\ncash flows based on each reporting unit\u2019s\ninternal forecast and the perpetuity growth\nmethod to calculate terminal values. Our DCF\ncalculation requires management to make\nestimates about future loan, deposit and\nrevenue growth, as well as credit losses and\ncapital rates. These cash flows and terminal\nvalues are then discounted using discount\nrates based on our external cost of capital\nwith adjustments for the risk inherent in each\nreporting unit. Discount rates used for our\nreporting units ranged from 8.3% to 12.4%, and\nwe applied a terminal year long-term growth\nrate of 3.8% to all reporting units. The\nreasonableness of our DCF calculation is\nassessed by reference to a market-based\napproach using comparable market multiples and\nrecent market transactions where available.\nThe usefulness of market data is inherently\nlimited due to the size and scope of our\noperations compared to most peer institutions\nand recent market transactions. The results of\nthe 2023 annual impairment test indicated that\nthe estimated fair values of the reporting\nunits exceeded their carrying amounts by\nbetween 12% and 121%. We also compare the\naggregate fair values of our reporting units\nto our market capitalization. Our assessment\nconsiders the level of premium expected to\nassume control of the Company in a market\ntransaction including anticipated cost savings\nand other synergies that would be realized in\na hypothetical transaction.\n\nThe results of the 2023 annual goodwill\nimpairment test for our Commercial Banking\nreporting unit concluded that, while the\nestimated fair value of this reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying amount, the percentage\nby which the estimated fair value of this\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying amount\nhad decreased to 12% from 17% in the 2022\nannual impairment test. The assumptions\nleveraged in the valuation of each reporting\nunit, including the Commercial Banking\nreporting unit, and the related risk of\nchanges in those assumptions are described\nfurther below.\n\nAssumptions used in estimating the fair value\nof a reporting unit are judgmental and\ninherently uncertain. A change in the economic\nconditions of a reporting unit, such as\ndeclines in business performance as a result\nof industry or macroeconomic trends or changes\nin our strategy, adverse impacts to loan or\ndeposit growth trends, decreases in revenue,\nincreases in expenses,\n                                              \n  74    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\ndeterioration in a significant loan portfolio,\nincreases in credit losses, increases in\ncapital requirements, deterioration of market\nconditions, declines in long-term growth\nexpectations, an increase in disposition\nactivity, adverse impacts of regulatory or\nlegislative changes or increases in the\nestimated cost of capital could cause the\nestimated fair values of our reporting units\nto decline in the future, and increase the\nrisk of a goodwill impairment in a future\nperiod. We perform sensitivity analyses around\ncertain assumptions in order to assess the\nreasonableness of the assumptions and the\nresulting estimated fair values.\n\nWe have a governance framework supported by\nprocesses and controls intended to ensure that\nthe accounting and disclosure for goodwill is\nappropriate. Our governance framework provides\nfor oversight of assumptions, forecast inputs,\nmethods, process controls and results.\n                                              \n  Fair Value                                  \n                                              \nFair value, also referred to as an exit price,\nis defined as the price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n\nLevel 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices\n(unadjusted) in active markets for identical\nassets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Valuation is based on observable\nmarket-based inputs other than Level 1 prices,\nsuch as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices in markets that are\nnot active, or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially the\nfull term of the assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 3: Valuation is generated from\ntechniques that use significant assumptions\nnot observable in the market. Valuation\ntechniques include pricing models, DCF\nmethodologies or similar techniques.\n\nThe degree of management judgment involved in\ndetermining the fair value of a financial\ninstrument is dependent upon the availability\nof quoted prices in active markets or\nobservable market parameters. When quoted\nprices and observable data in active markets\nare not fully available, management judgment\nis necessary to estimate fair value. Changes\nin market conditions, such as reduced\nliquidity in the capital markets or changes in\nsecondary market activities, may reduce the\navailability and reliability of quoted prices\nor observable data used to determine fair\nvalue.\n\nWe have developed policies and procedures to\ndetermine when markets for our financial\nassets and liabilities are inactive if the\nlevel and volume of activity has declined\nsignificantly relative to normal conditions.\nIf markets are determined to be inactive, it\nmay be appropriate to adjust price quotes\nreceived. When significant adjustments are\nrequired to price quotes or inputs, it may be\nappropriate to utilize an estimate based\nprimarily on unobservable inputs.\n\nSignificant judgment may be required to\ndetermine whether certain financial\ninstruments measured at fair value are\nclassified as Level 2 or Level 3. In making\nthis determination, we consider all available\ninformation that market participants use to\nmeasure the fair value of the financial\ninstrument, including observable market data,\nindications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the\nvaluation techniques and significant inputs\nused. Based upon the specific facts and\ncircumstances of each instrument or instrument\ncategory, judgments are made regarding the\nsignificance of the Level 3 inputs to the\ninstruments\u2019 fair value measurement in its\nentirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. We\ndiscuss changes in the valuation inputs and\nassumptions used in determining the fair value\nof our financial instruments, including the\nextent to which we have relied on significant\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value and\nour process for corroborating these inputs, in\n\u201cItem 8.

The FVC\nregularly reviews and approves our fair\nvaluations to ensure that our valuation\npractices are consistent with industry\nstandards and adhere to regulatory and\naccounting guidance.\n\nWe have model policies, established by an\nindependent Model Risk Office, which govern\nthe validation of models and related\nsupporting documentation to ensure the\nappropriate use of models for pricing and fair\nvalue measurements. The Model Risk Office\nvalidates all models and requires ongoing\nmonitoring of their performance.\n\nThe fair value governance process is set up in\na manner that allows the Chairperson of the\nFVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot\nbe resolved by the FVC to a more senior\ncommittee called the Valuations Advisory\nCommittee (\u201cVAC\u201d) for resolution. The VAC is\nchaired by the Chief Financial Officer and\nincludes other members of senior manageme nt.\nThere were no disputes escalated to the VAC\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\n                                              \n  Customer Rewards Reserve                    \n                                              \nWe offer products, primarily credit cards,\nwhich include programs that allow members to\nearn rewards based on account activity that\ncan be redeemed for cash (primarily in the\nform of statement credits), gift cards,\ntravel, or covering eligible charges. The\namount of rewards that a customer earns varies\nbased on the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program and product. The majority of\nour rewards do not expire and there is no\nlimit on the amount of rewards an eligible\ncard member can earn. Customer rewards costs,\nwhich we generally record as an offset to\ninterchange income, are driven by various\nfactors such as card member purchase volume,\nthe terms and conditions of the rewards\nprogram and rewards redemption cost. We\nestablish a customer rewards reserve that\nreflects management\u2019s judgment regarding\nrewards earned that are expected to be\nredeemed and the estimated redemption cost.\n\nWe use financial models to estimate ultimate\nredemption rates of rewards earned by current\ncard members based on historical redemption\ntrends, current enrollee redemption behavior,\ncard product type, year of program enrollment,\nenrollment tenure and card spend levels. Our\ncurrent assumption is that the vast majority\nof all rewards earned will eventually be\nredeemed. We use the weighted-average\nredemption cost during the previous twelve\nmonths, adjusted as appropriate for recent\nchanges in redemption costs, including changes\nrelated to the mix of rewards redeemed, to\nestimate future redemption costs. We\ncontinually evaluate our reserve and\nassumptions based on developments in\nredemption patterns, changes to the terms and\nconditions of the rewards program and other\nfactors. While the rewards liability is\nsensitive to changes in assumptions for\nredemption rates and costs and involves\nmanagement judgment, we believe portfolio\ncharacteristics and historical performance are\nthe best indication of future reward\nredemption behavior and are the primary basis\nfor our estimate. We recognized customer\nrewards expense of $8.2 billion, $7.6 billion\nand $6.4 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Our customer rewards reserve,\nwhich is included in other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets, totaled $7.4\nbillion and $6.8 billion as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nWe have a governance framework supported by\nprocesses and controls that are intended to\nensure that our rewards liability estimate is\nappropriate and reliable. Our governance\nframework provides for oversight of\nassumptions, inputs, methods, process controls\nand results. Additional controls are performed\nto ensure all underlying data used to derive\nthe rewards liability is complete and\naccurate.\n                                              \n  76    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                       \n  ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS  \n                                       \nAccounting Standards Issued but Not Adopted as\nof December 31, 2023\n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                                Effective     \n                                January 1,    \n                                2025, with    \n                                early         \n                                adoption      \n                                permitted,    \n                                using either  \n                                the           \n                                prospective   \n  Income Tax                    or            \n  Disclosures    Requires       retrospecti\u2026  \n  Accounting     entities to    transition    \n  Standards      provide        method.       \n  Update         additional     We plan to    \n  (\u201cASU\u201d) No.    information    adopt this    \n  2023-09,       in the         standard on   \n  Income         income tax     its           \n  Taxes          rate           effective     \n  (Topic         reconcilia\u2026    date using a  \n  740):Impro\u2026    and make       prospective   \n  to Income      additional     transition    \n  Tax            disclosures    method.

The Basel III Capital\nRules implement certain capital requirements\npublished by the Basel Committee, along with\ncertain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and\nother capital provisions.\n\nAs a BHC with total consolidated assets of at\nleast $250 billion but less than $700 billion\nand not exceeding any of the applicable risk-\nbased thresholds, the Company is a Category\nIII institution under the Basel III Capital\nRules.\n\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III\ninstitution, is a Category III bank. Moreover,\nthe Bank, as an insured depository\ninstitution, is subject to PCA capital\nregulations.\n                                              \n  Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules            \n                                              \nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%,\na Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and a total\ncapital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in\nrelation to risk-weighted assets. In addition,\nwe must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of\n4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage\nratio of 3.0%. We are also subject to the\ncapital conservation buffer requirement and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement,\neach as described below. Our capital and\nleverage ratios are calculated based on the\nBasel III standardized approach framework.\n\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of\nAOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted\nfor a Category III institution.

Under the\nStress Capital Buffer Rule, the Company\u2019s\n\u201cstandardized approach capital conservation\nbuffer\u201d includes its stress capital buffer\nrequirement (as described below), any G-SIB\nSurcharge (which is not applicable to us) and\nthe countercyclical capital buffer requirement\n(which is currently set at 0%) . Any\ndetermination to increase the countercyclical\ncapital buffer generally would be effective\ntwelve months after the announcement of such\nan increase, unless the Federal Banking\nAgencies set an earlier effective date.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stress capital buffer\nrequirement is recalibrated every year based\non the Company\u2019s supervisory stress test\nresults. In particular, the Company\u2019s stress\ncapital buffer requirement equals, subject to\na floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference\nbetween the Company\u2019s starting CET1 capital\nratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital\nratio under the severely adverse scenario of\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress test\nplus (ii) the ratio of the Company\u2019s projected\nfour quarters of common stock dividends (for\nthe fourth to seventh quarters of the planning\nhorizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets\nfor the quarter in which the Company\u2019s\nprojected CET1 capital ratio reaches its\nminimum under the supervisory stress test.\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2022 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023 was\n3.1%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework were 7.6%,\n9.1% and 11.1%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2022 through September 30,\n2023.\n                                              \n  78    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the Company\u2019s 2023 supervisory stress\ntest results, the Company\u2019s stress capital\nbuffer requirement for the period beginning on\nOctober 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024 is\n4.8%. Therefore, the Company\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus the standardized approach\ncapital conservation buffer for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital and total capital ratios under\nthe stress capital buffer framework are 9.3%,\n10.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the period\nfrom October 1, 2023 through September 30,\n2024.\n\nThe Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply\nto the Bank. Pursuant to the OCC\u2019s capital\nregulations, which are only applicable to the\nBank, the capital conservation buffer for the\nBank continues to be fixed at 2.5%.\nAccordingly, the Bank\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirements plus its capital conservation\nbuffer for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and\ntotal capital ratios are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%,\nrespectively.\n\nIf the Company or the Bank fails to maintain\nits capital ratios above the minimum capital\nrequirements plus the applicable capital\nconservation buffer requirements, it will face\nincreasingly strict automatic limitations on\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus\npayments to certain executive officers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, the Company and the Bank eac h\nexceeded the minimum capital requirements and\nthe capital conservation buffer requirements\napplicable to them, and the Company and the\nBank were each \u201c well-capitalized. \u201d The\n\u201cwell-capitalized\u201d standards applicable to the\nCompany are established in the Federal\nReserve\u2019s regulations, and the \u201cwell-\ncapitalized\u201d standards applicable to the Bank\nare established in the OCC\u2019s PCA capital\nrequirements.\n                                              \n  CECL Transition Rule                        \n                                              \nThe Federal Banking Agencies adopted the CECL\nTransition Rule that provides banking\ninstitutions an optional five-year transition\nperiod to phase in the impact of the CECL\nstandard on their regulatory capital, the CECL\nTransition Election. We adopted the CECL\nstandard (for accounting purposes) as of\nJanuary 1, 2020, and made the CECL Transition\nElection (for regulatory capital purposes) in\nthe first quarter of 2020. Therefore, the\napplicable amounts presented in this Report\nreflect such election.\n\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

             \nThis element of the Framework sets the\nfoundation for the methods for governing risk\ntaking and the interactions within and among\nour three lines of defense.\n\nWe established a risk governance structure and\naccountabilities to effectively and\nconsistently oversee the management of risks\nacross the Company. Our Board of Directors,\nChief Executive Officer and management\nestablish the tone at the top regarding the\nculture of the Company, including management\nof risk. Management reinforces expectations at\nthe various levels of the organization.\n                                              \n  Strategy and Risk Alignment                 \n                                              \nOur strategy is informed by and aligned with\nrisk appetite, from development to execution.\nThe Chief Executive Officer develops the\nstrategy with input from the first, second,\nand third lines of defense, as well as the\nBoard of Directors. The strategic planning\nprocess considers relevant changes to the\nCompany\u2019s overall risk profile.\n\nOur Board of Directors approves a Risk\nAppetite Statement for the Company to set\nforth the high-level principles that govern\nrisk taking at the Company. The Risk Appetite\nStatement defines the Board of Directors\u2019\ntolerance for certain risk outcomes at an\nenterprise level and enables senior management\nto manage and report within these boundaries.\nThis Risk Appetite Statement is also supported\nby risk category specific risk appetite\nstatements as well as metrics and, where\nappropriate, Board Limits and Board\nNotification Thresholds.\n                                              \n  Risk Identification                         \n                                              \nThe first line of defense and certain Support\nFunctions identify new and emerging risks,\nincluding concentration of risk, across the\nrelevant risk categories associated with their\nbusiness activities and objectives, in\nconsultation with IRM. Risk identification\nalso must be informed by major changes in\ninfrastructure or organization, introduction\nof new products and services, acquisitions of\nbusinesses, or substantial changes in the\ninternal or external environment.\n\nIRM and certain Support Functions, where\nappropriate, provide effective challenge in\nthe risk identification process. IRM is also\nresponsible for identifying our material\naggregate risks on an ongoing basis.\n                                              \n  84    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Assessment, Measurement and Response        \n                                              \nManagement assesses risks associated with our\nactivities. Risks identified are assessed to\nunderstand the severity of each risk and\nlikelihood of occurrence under both normal and\nstressful conditions. Risk severity is\nmeasured through modeling and other\nquantitative estimation approaches, as well as\nqualitative approaches, based on management\njudgment. As part of the risk assessment\nprocess, the first and second lines of defense\nalso evaluate the effectiveness of the\nexisting control environment and mitigation\nstrategies.\n\nManagement determines the appropriate risk\nresponse. Risks may be mitigated or accepted.\nActions taken to respond to the risk include\nimplementing new controls, enhancing existing\ncontrols, developing additional mitigation\nstrategies to reduce the impact of the risk,\nand/or monitoring the risk.\n                                              \n  Monitoring and Testing                      \n                                              \nManagement periodically monitors risks to\nevaluate and measure how the risk is affecting\nour strategy and business objectives, in\nalignment with risk appetite, including\nestablished concentration risk limits. The\nscope and frequency of monitoring activities\ndepends on the results of relevant risk\nassessments, as well as specific business risk\noperations and activities.\n\nThe first line of defense is required to\nevaluate the effectiveness of risk management\npractices and controls through testing and\nother activities. IRM and Support Functions,\nas appropriate, assess the first line of\ndefense\u2019s evaluation of risk management, which\nmay include conducting effective challenge,\nperforming independent monitoring, or\nconducting risk or control validations. The\nthird line of defense provides independent\nassurance for first and second line risk\nmanagement practices and controls.\n                                              \n  Aggregation, Reporting and Escalation       \n                                              \nRisk aggregation supports strategic decision\nmaking and risk management practices through\ncollectively reporting risks across different\nlevels of the Company and providing a\ncomprehensive view of performance against risk\nappetite. Our risk aggregation processes are\ndesigned to aggregate risk information from\nlower levels of the business hierarchy to high\nlevels and to aggregate risk information to\ndetermine material risk themes.\n\nMaterial risks, new or emerging risks,\naggregate risks, risk appetite metrics and\nother measures across all risk categories are\nreported to the appropriate governance forum\nno less than quarterly. Material risks are\nreported to the Board of Directors and senior\nmanagement committees no less than quarterly.\n                                              \n   Capital and Liquidity Management           \n   (including Stress Testing)                 \n                                              \nOur capital management processes are linked to\nits risk management practices, including the\nenterprise-wide identification, assessment and\nmeasurement of risks to ensure that all\nrelevant risks are incorporated in the\nassessment of the Company's capital adequacy.\nWe use identified risks to inform key aspects\nof the Company\u2019s capital planning, including\nthe development of stress scenarios, the\nassessment of the adequacy of post-stress\ncapital levels, and the appropriateness of\npotential capital actions considering the\nCompany\u2019s capital objectives. We quantify\ncapital needs through stress testing,\nregulatory capital, economic capital and\nassessments of market considerations. In\nassessing its capital adequacy, we identify\nhow and where our material risks are accounted\nfor within the capital planning process.\nMonitoring and escalation processes exist for\nkey capital thresholds and metrics to\ncontinuously monitor capital adequacy.\n\nWe manage liquidity risk by applying our\nLiquidity Adequacy Framework (the \u201cLiquidity\nFramework\u201d). The Liquidity Framework uses\ninternal and regulatory stress testing and the\nevaluation of other balance sheet metrics to\nconfirm that we maintain a fortified balance\nsheet that is resilient to uncertainties that\nmay arise as a consequence of systemic,\nidiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events.\n                                              \n  Risk Data and Enabling Technology           \n                                              \nRisk data and technology provides the basis\nfor risk reporting and is used in decision\nmaking and to monitor and review changes to\nour risk profile.

Consequently, we\ntry to ensure our credit portfolio is\nresilient to economic downturns. Our most\nimportant tool in this endeavor is sound\nunderwriting. In unsecured consumer loan\nunderwriting, we generally assume that loans\nwill be subject to an environment in which\nlosses are higher than those prevailing at the\ntime of underwriting. In commercial\nunderwriting, we generally require strong cash\nflow, collateral, covenants, and guarantees.\nIn addition to sound underwriting, we\ncontinually monitor our portfolio and take\nsteps to collect or work out distressed loans.\n\nThe Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer,\nin conjunction with the Chief Credit Officers,\nis responsible for establishing credit risk\npolicies and procedures, including\nunderwriting and hold guidelines and credit\napproval authority, and monitoring credit\nexposure and performance of our lending\nrelated transactions. Our Chief Credit\nOfficers are responsible for evaluating the\nrisk implications of credit strategy and the\noversight of credit for both the existing\nportfolio and any new credit investments. They\nalso have formal approval authority for\nvarious types and levels of credit decisions,\nincluding individual commercial loan\ntransactions. Division Presidents within each\nsegment are responsible for managing the\ncredit risk within their divisions and\nmaintaining processes to control credit risk\nand comply with credit policies and\nguidelines. In addition, the Chief Credit and\nFinancial Risk Officer establishes policies,\ndelegates approval authority and monitors\nperformance for non-loan credit exposure\nentered into with financial counterparties or\nthrough the purchase of credit sensitive\nsecurities in our investment portfolio.\n\nOur credit policies establish standards in\nfive areas: customer selection, underwriting,\nmonitoring, remediation and portfolio\nmanagement. The standards in each area provide\na framework comprising specific objectives and\ncontrol processes. These standards are\nsupported by detailed policies and procedures\nfor each component of the credit process.\nStarting with customer selection, our goal is\nto generally provide credit on terms that\ngenerate above hurdle returns. We use a number\nof quantitative and qualitative factors to\nmanage credit risk, including setting credit\nrisk limits and guidelines for each of our\nlines of business. We monitor performance\nrelative to these guidelines and report\nresults and any required mitigating actions to\nappropriate senior management committees and\nour Board of Directors.\n                                              \n   Liquidity Risk Management                  \n                                              \nWe recognize that liquidity risk is embedded\nwithin our day-to-day and strategic decisions.\nLiquidity is essential for banks to meet\ncustomer withdrawals, account for balance\nsheet changes, and provide funding for growth.\nWe have acquired and built deposit gathering\nbusinesses and actively monitor our funding\nconcentration. We manage our liquidity risk,\nwhich is driven by both internal and external\nfactors, centrally and establish quantitative\nrisk limits to continually assess our\nliquidity adequacy.\n\nThe Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer,\nin conjunction with the Head of Liquidity,\nMarket and Capital Risk Oversight, is\nresponsible for the establishment of liquidity\nrisk management policies and standards for\ngovernance and monitoring of liquidity risk at\na corporate level. We assess liquidity\nstrength by evaluating several different\nbalance sheet metrics under severe stress\nscenarios to ensure we can withstand\nsignificant funding degradation. Results are\nreported to the Asset Liability Committee\nmonthly and to the Risk Committee no less than\nquarterly. We also continuously monitor market\nand economic conditions to evaluate emerging\nstress conditions and to develop appropriate\naction plans in accordance with our\nContingency Funding Plan (\u201cCFP\u201d) and our\nRecovery Plan.\n\nWe use internal and regulatory stress testing\nand the evaluation of other balance sheet\nmetrics within our Liquidity Framework to\nconfirm we maintain a fortified balance sheet.\nWe rely on a combination of stable and\ndiversified funding sources, along with a\nstockpile of liquidity reserves, to\neffectively manage our liquidity risk. We\nmaintain a sizable liquidity reserve of cash\nand cash equivalents, high-quality\nunencumbered securities and investment\nsecurities and certain loans that are either\nreadily-marketable or pledgeable. We also\ncontinue to maintain access to secured and\nunsecured debt markets through regular\nissuance.\n                                              \n   Market Risk Management                     \n                                              \nWe recognize that interest rate and foreign\nexchange risk are present in our business due\nto the nature of our assets and liabilities.\nMarket risk is inherent from the financial\ninstruments associated with our business\noperations and activities including loans,\ndeposits, securities, short-term borrowings,\nlong-term debt and derivatives.

The market risk position is\ncalculated and analyzed against pre-\nestablished limits. We use industry accepted\ntechniques to analyze and measure interest\nrate and foreign exchange risk and we perform\nsensitivity analysis to identify our risk\nexposures under a broad range of scenarios.\nResults are reported to the Asset Liability\nCommittee monthly and to the Risk Committee no\nless than quarterly.\n\nManagement is authorized to utilize financial\ninstruments as outlined in our policy to\nactively manage market risk exposure.\nInvestment securities and derivatives are the\nmain levers for the management of interest\nrate risk. In addition, we also use\nderivatives to manage our foreign exchange\nrisk.\n                                              \n   Operational Risk Management                \n                                              \nWe recognize the criticality of managing\noperational risk on both a strategic and day-\nto-day basis and that there are heightened\nexpectations from our regulators and our\ncustomers. We have implemented appropriate\noperational risk management policies,\nstandards, processes and controls to enable\nthe delivery of high quality and consistent\ncustomer experiences and to achieve business\nobjectives in a controlled manner.\n\nThe Chief Operational Risk Officer, in\ncollaboration with the CTRO, is responsible\nfor establishing and overseeing our\nOperational Risk Management Program. The\nprogram establishes practices for assessing\nthe operational risk profile and executing key\ncontrol processes for operational risks. These\nrisks include topics such as internal and\nexternal fraud, cyber and technology risk,\ndata management, model risk, third-party\nmanagement, and business continuity.\nOperational Risk Management and Technology\nRisk Management enforce these practices and\ndelivers reporting of operational risk results\nto senior business leaders, the executive\ncommittee and the Board of Directors.

Areas of concern have\nexpanded to include company policies,\npractices and values and, with the growing use\nof social and digital platforms, public\ncorporations face a new level of scrutiny and\nchannels for activism and advocacy. The\nheightened expectations of internal and\nexternal stakeholders have made corporate\nculture, values and conduct pressure points\nfor individuals and advocates voicing concerns\nor seeking change. We manage both strategic\nand tactical reputation issues and build our\nrelationships with government officials,\nmedia, community and consumer advocates,\ncustomers and other constituencies to help\nstrengthen the reputations of both our Company\nand industry. Our actions include implementing\npro-customer practices in our business and\nserving low to moderate income communities in\nour market area consistent with a quality bank\nand an innovative technology leader.

Our\nprimary loan products include credit cards,\nauto loans and commercial lending products.\n\n\u2022 Credit cards: We originate both prime and\nsubprime credit cards through a variety of\nchannels. Our credit cards generally have\nvariable interest rates. Credit card accounts\nare primarily underwritten using an automated\nunderwriting system based on predictive models\nthat we have developed. The underwriting\ncriteria, which are customized for individual\nproducts and marketing programs, are\nestablished based on an analysis of the net\npresent value of expected revenues, expenses\nand losses, subject to further analysis using\na variety of stress conditions. Underwriting\ndecisions are generally based on credit bureau\ninformation, including payment history, debt\nburden and credit scores, such as Fair Isaac\nCorporation (\u201cFICO\u201d) scores, and on other\nfactors, such as applicant income. We maintain\na credit card securitization program and\nselectively sell charged-off credit card\nloans.\n\n\u2022 Auto: We originate both prime and subprime\nauto loans through a network of auto dealers\nand direct marketing. Our auto loans have\nfixed interest rates and loan terms of 75\nmonths or less, but can go up to 84 months.\nLoan size limits are customized by program and\nare generally less than $75,000. Similar to\ncredit card accounts, the underwriting\ncriteria are customized for individual\nproducts and marketing programs and based on\nanalysis of net present value of expected\nrevenues, expenses and losses, and are subject\nto maintaining resilience under a variety of\nstress conditions. Underwriting decisions are\ngenerally based on an applicant\u2019s income,\nestimated net disposable income, and credit\nbureau information including FICO scores,\nalong with collateral characteristics such as\nloan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratio. We maintain an\nauto securitization program.\n\n\u2022 Commercial: We offer a range of commercial\nlending products, including loans secured by\ncommercial real estate and loans to middle\nmarket commercial and industrial companies.\nOur commercial loans may have a fixed or\nvariable interest rate; however, the majority\nof our commercial loans have variable rates.\nOur underwriting standards require an analysis\nof the borrower\u2019s financial condition and\nprospects, as well as an assessment of the\nindustry in which the borrower operates. Where\nrelevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying\ncollateral and guarantees. We maintain\nunderwriting guidelines and limits for major\ntypes of borrowers and loan products that\nspecify, where applicable, guidelines for debt\nservice coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and\nstandard covenants and conditions. We assign a\nrisk rating and establish a monitoring\nschedule for loans based on the risk profile\nof the borrower, industry segment, source of\nrepayment, the underlying collateral and\nguarantees, if any, and current market\nconditions. Although we generally retain the\ncommercial loans we underwrite, we may\nsyndicate positions for risk mitigation\npurposes, including bridge financing\ntransactions we have underwritten. In\naddition, we originate and service multifamily\ncommercial real estate loans which are sold to\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises where we\nretain certain levels of residual risk after\nthe loans are sold.\n                                              \n  89    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\nPortfolio and Geographic Composition of Loans\nHeld for Investment\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for\ninvestment, including loans held in our\nconsolidated trusts, and loans held for sale.\nThe information presented in this section\nexcludes loans held for sale, which totaled\n$854 million and $203 million as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTable 15 presents the composition of our\nportfolio of loans held for investment by\nportfolio segment as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\n\nTable 15: Portfolio Composition of Loans Held\nfor Investment\n                                              \n           De\u2026                 De\u2026            \n           31,                 31,            \n           20\u2026                 20\u2026            \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  (\u2026                %                   %     \n  in       Lo\u2026     of          Lo\u2026     of     \n  m\u2026              To\u2026                 To\u2026     \n  C\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  D\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026    $  14\u2026    46\u2026  %    $  13\u2026    42\u2026  %  \n  c\u2026                                          \n  I\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       6,\u2026    2.1          6,\u2026    2.0     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       15\u2026    48\u2026          13\u2026    44\u2026     \n  c\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  A\u2026       74\u2026    23\u2026          78\u2026    25\u2026     \n  R\u2026       1,\u2026    0.5          1,\u2026    0.5     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       75\u2026    23\u2026          79\u2026    25\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  B\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026                                          \n  m\u2026       34\u2026    10\u2026          37\u2026    12\u2026     \n  r\u2026                                          \n  e\u2026                                          \n  C\u2026                                          \n  a\u2026       56\u2026    17\u2026          57\u2026    18\u2026     \n  i\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  c\u2026       90\u2026    28\u2026          94\u2026    30\u2026     \n  b\u2026                                          \n  T\u2026                                          \n  l\u2026                                          \n  h\u2026    $  32\u2026    10\u2026  %    $  31\u2026    10\u2026  %  \n  f\u2026                                          \n  i\u2026                                          \n                                              \n                                              \n  90    Capital One Financial Corporation     \n        (COF)                                 \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 16 presents the maturities of our loans\nheld for investment portfolio as of December\n31, 2023.

Trends in\ndelinquency rates are the key credit quality\nindicator for our credit card and retail\nbanking loan portfolios as changes in\ndelinquency rates can provide an early warning\nof changes in potential future credit losses.\nThe key indicator we monitor when assessing\nthe credit quality and risk of our auto loan\nportfolio is borrower credit scores as they\nprovide insight into borrower risk profiles,\nwhich give indications of potential future\ncredit losses. The key credit quality\nindicator for our commercial loan portfolios\nis our internal risk ratings as we generally\nclassify loans that have been delinquent for\nan extended period of time and other loans\nwith significant risk of loss as\nnonperforming. In addition to these credit\nquality indicators, we also manage and monitor\nother credit quality metrics such as level of\nnonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.\n\nWe underwrite most consumer loans using\nproprietary models, which typically include\ncredit bureau data, such as borrower credit\nscores, application information and, where\napplicable, collateral and deal structure\ndata. We continuously adjust our management of\ncredit lines and collection strategies based\non customer behavior and risk profile changes.\nWe also use borrower credit scores for\nsubprime classification, for competitive\nbenchmarking and, in some cases, to drive\nproduct segmentation decisions.\n\nTable 21 provides details on the credit scores\nof our domestic credit card and auto loan\nportfolios as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n                                              \n  Table 21: Credit Score Distribution         \n                                              \n                                              \n  (Percent\u2026                                   \n  of            December         December     \n  portfoli\u2026     31, 2023         31, 2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Domestic                                    \n  credit                                      \n  card\u2014Ref\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             68  %            69  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  660 or              32               31     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n  Auto\u2014At                                     \n  originat\u2026                                   \n  FICO                                        \n  scores:(\u2026                                   \n  Greater             53  %            53  %  \n  than 660                                    \n  621 - 660           20               20     \n  620 or              27               27     \n  below                                       \n  Total              100  %           100  %  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Percentages represent period-end loans\nheld for investment in each credit score\ncategory.

In determining\nthe risk rating of a particular loan, some of\nthe factors considered are the borrower\u2019s\ncurrent financial condition, historical and\nprojected future credit performance, prospects\nfor support from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\n\nWe present information in the section below on\nthe credit performance of our loan portfolio,\nincluding the key metrics we use in tracking\nchanges in the credit quality of our loan\nportfolio.

We\ncharge off loans as a reduction to the\nallowance for credit losses when we determine\nthe loan is uncollectible and record\nsubsequent recoveries of previously charged\noff amounts as increases to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Uncollectible finance charges\nand fees are reversed through revenue and\ncertain fraud losses are recorded in other\nnon-interest expense. Generally, costs to\nrecover charged off loans are recorded as\ncollection expenses as incurred and are\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense. Our charge-off policy for loans\nvaries based on the loan type.

The ASU\neliminates the accounting guidance for\ntroubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDR\u201d) and\nestablishes disclosure requirements for\ncertain loan refinancing and restructurings\nfor borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty, which results in a more than\ninsignificant impact to the timing or amount\nof contractual cash flows.\n\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, a\nmodification was deemed a TDR when the\ncontractual terms of a loan agreement were\nmodified by granting a concession to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty.\nASU 2022-02 eliminated the concession\nrequirement for modifications. After the\nadoption of ASU 2022-02, a financial\ndifficulty modification (\u201cFDM\u201d) occurs when a\nmodification in the form of principal\nforgiveness, interest rate reduction, an\nother-than-insignificant payment delay, a term\nextension or a combination of these\nmodifications is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty.\n\nThe types of modifications we offer to\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty\nhave not changed as a result of the adoption\nof ASU 2022-02. As part of our loss mitigation\nefforts, we may provide short-term (one to\ntwelve months) or long-term (greater than\ntwelve months) modifications to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty to improve\nlong-term collectability of the loan and to\navoid the need for repossession or foreclosure\nof collateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications, including FDMs, when estimating\nthe credit quality of our loan portfolio and\nestablishing allowance levels. For our\nCommercial Banking customers, loan\nmodifications are also considered in the\nassignment of an internal risk rating.\n\nIn our Credit Card business, the majority of\nour FDMs receive an interest rate reduction\nand are placed on a fixed payment plan not\nexceeding 60 months. If the customer does not\ncomply with the modified payment terms, then\nthe credit card loan agreement may revert to\nits original payment terms, generally\nresulting in any loan outstanding being\nreflected in the appropriate delinquency\ncategory and charged off in accordance with\nour standard charge-off policy.\n\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority\nof our FDMs receive an extension, an interest\nrate reduction, principal reduction, or a\ncombination of these modifications.\n\nIn our Commercial Banking business, the\nmajority of our FDMs receive an extension. A\nportion of FDMs receive an interest rate\nreduction, principal reduction, or a\ncombination of modifications.\n\nFor additional information on accounting\nstandards adopted during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, see Item 8. Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note\n1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nFor more information on FDMs in 2023 and TDRs\nin 2022, see Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data\u2014Note 3\u2014Loans.\u201d\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement\u2019s current estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the contractual terms of\nour loans held for investment as of each\nbalance sheet date. Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. We also estimate expected credit\nlosses related to unfunded lending commitments\nthat are not unconditionally cancellable.

For\neach of these programs, the ability to borrow\nutilizing these sources is dependent on\nmeeting the respective membership\nrequirements. Our borrowing capacity in each\nprogram is a function of the collateral the\nBank has posted with each counterparty,\nincluding any respective haircuts applied to\nthat collateral.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we pledged both loans\nand securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum\nborrowing capacity of $32.1 billion, of which\n$50 million was used.

We are exposed to\nmarket risk primarily from the following\noperations and activities:\n\n\u2022 Traditional banking activities of deposit\ngathering and lending;\n\n\u2022 Asset/liability management activities\nincluding the management of investment\nsecurities, short-term and long-term\nborrowings and derivatives;\n\n\u2022 Foreign operations in the U.K. and Canada\nwithin our Credit Card business; and\n\n\u2022 Customer accommodation activities within our\nCommercial Banking business.\n\nWe have enterprise-wide risk management\npolicies and limits, approved by our Board of\nDirectors, which govern our market risk\nmanagement activities. Our objective is to\nmanage our exposure to market risk in\naccordance with these policies and limits\nbased on prevailing market conditions and\nlong-term expectations. We provide additional\ninformation below about our primary sources of\nmarket risk, our market risk management\nstrategies and the measures that we use to\nevaluate these exposures.\n                                              \n  Interest Rate Risk                          \n                                              \nInterest rate risk represents exposure to\nfinancial instruments whose values vary with\nthe level or volatility of interest rates. We\nare exposed to interest rate risk primarily\nfrom the differences in the timing between the\nmaturities or repricing of assets and\nliabilities. We manage our interest rate risk\nprimarily by entering into interest rate swaps\nand other derivative instruments which could\ninclude caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts.\n                                              \n  105    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nWe use various industry standard market risk\nmeasurement techniques and analyses to\nmeasure, assess and manage the impact of\nchanges in interest rates on our net interest\nincome and our economic value of equity and\nchanges in foreign exchange rates on our non-\ndollar-denominated funding and non-dollar\nequity investments in foreign operations.\n                                              \n  Net Interest Income Sensitivity             \n                                              \nOur net interest income sensitivity measure\nestimates the impact of hypothetical\ninstantaneous movements in interest rates\nrelative to our baseline interest rate\nforecast on our projected 12-month net\ninterest income. Net interest income\nsensitivity metrics are derived using the\nfollowing key assumptions:\n\n\u2022 In addition to our existing assets,\nliabilities and derivative positions, we\nincorporate expected future business growth\nassumptions. These assumptions include loan\nand deposit growth, pricing, plans for\nprojected changes in our funding mix and our\nsecurities and cash position from our internal\ncorporate outlook that is used in our\nfinancial planning process.\n\n\u2022 The analysis assumes this forecast of\nexpected future business growth remains\nunchanged between the baseline rate forecast\nand rate shock scenarios, including no changes\nto our interest rate risk management\nactivities like securities and hedging\nactions.\n\n\u2022 We incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit\nre-pricing, which includes pricing lags and\nchanges in deposit beta and mix as interest\nrates change, and the prepayment sensitivity\nof our mortgage securities to the level of\ninterest rates. In our models, deposit betas\nand mortgage security prepayments vary\ndynamically based on the level of interest\nrates and by product type.\n\n\u2022 In instances where an interest rate scenario\nwould result in a rate less than 0.00%, we\nassume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This\nassumption applies only to jurisdictions that\ndo not have a practice of employing negative\npolicy rates. In jurisdictions that have\nnegative policy rates, we do not floor\ninterest rates at 0.00%.\n\nAt the current level of interest rates, our\nnet interest income is expected to increase in\nhigher rate scenarios and decrease in lower\nrate scenarios. Our current sensitivity to\nboth upward and downward shocks is largely\nunchanged as compared to December 31, 2022, as\nour asset mix shift toward credit card and\ninterest-bearing cash balances, which reprice\nrapidly, was offset by an increase in deposit\nbeta, which was driven by higher interest\nrates and mix shift toward higher rate deposit\nproducts. In the contexts used in this\nsection, \u201cbeta\u201d refers to the change in\ndeposit rate paid relative to the federal\nfunds rate.\n\nAs part of our ongoing evaluation of our\ninterest rate risk modeling capabilities, we\nenhanced our mortgage prepayment model in the\nfourth quarter of 2023 to improve how we\nestimate the expected prepayment behavior\nacross various interest rate scenarios. This\nenhancement had the effect of slowing down the\nforecasted prepayment speed when the\nunderlying mortgage coupons on our existing\nmortgage securities are well below prevailing\n(market) mortgage rates, which resulted in\nslightly lower net interest income sensitivity\nas of December 31, 2023.\n                                              \n  106    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n  Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity        \n                                              \nOur economic value of equity sensitivity\nmeasure estimates the impact of hypothetical\ninstantaneous movements in interest rates on\nthe net present value of our assets and\nliabilities, including derivative exposures.\nEconomic value of equity sensitivity metrics\nare derived using the following key\nassumptions:\n\n\u2022 The analysis includes only existing assets,\nliabilities and derivative positions and does\nnot incorporate business growth assumptions or\nprojected balance sheet changes.\n\n\u2022 Similar to our net interest income\nsensitivity measure, we incorporate the\ndynamic nature of deposit repricing and\nattrition, which includes pricing lags and\nchanges in deposit beta as interest rates\nchange and the prepayment sensitivity of our\nmortgage securities to the level of interest\nrates. In our models, deposit betas and\nmortgage security prepayments vary dynamically\nbased on the level of interest rates and by\nproduct type.\n\n\u2022 Balance attrition assumptions for loans,\nincluding credit card, auto and commercial\nloans, remain unchanged between the baseline\ninterest rate forecast and interest rate shock\nscenarios as those loans are mainly floating\nrate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and\nhence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the\nlevel of interest rates.\n\n\u2022 For assets and liabilities with embedded\noptionality, such as mortgage securities and\ndeposit balances, we utilize monte carlo\nsimulations to assess economic value with\nindustry-standard term structure modeling of\ninterest rates.\n\n\u2022 Our calculations of net present value apply\nappropriate spreads over the benchmark yield\ncurve for select assets and liabilities to\ncapture the inherent risks (including credit\nrisk) to discount expected interest and\nprincipal cash flows.\n\n\u2022 In instances where an interest rate scenario\nwould result in a rate less than 0.00%, we\nassume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This\nassumption applies only to jurisdictions that\ndo not have a practice of employing negative\npolicy rates. In jurisdictions that have\nnegative policy rates, we do not floor\ninterest rates at 0.00%.\n\nOur current economic value of equity\nsensitivity profile demonstrates that our\neconomic value of equity decreases in higher\ninterest rate scenarios and increases in lower\ninterest rate scenarios. The decrease in\nhigher rate scenarios is due to the declines\nin the projected value of our fixed rate\nassets being only partially offset by\ncorresponding movements in the projected value\nof our deposits and other liabilities. The\npace of economic value of equity decrease is\nlarger for the +200 bps scenario as our\ndeposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly\nin higher interest rate environments. Our\ncurrent economic value of equity sensitivity\nbecame more negative in higher interest rate\nscenarios and more positive in lower interest\nrate scenarios as compared to December 31,\n2022, primarily due to an increase in deposit\nbeta driven by higher interest rates and mix\nshift towards higher rate deposit products,\nand a modeling change for our mortgage\nsecurity prepayments forecast. As described\nabove for net interest income sensitivity, the\nmortgage prepayment modeling change slowed\ndown the prepayment speed forecast and\nincreased the duration of the mortgage\nsecurities on our balance sheet, which\nresulted in a modestly more negative economic\nvalue of equity sensitivity in higher rate\nscenarios as of December 31, 2023.\n                                              \n  107    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n\nTable 33 shows the estimated percentage impact\non our projected baseline net interest income\nand our current economic value of equity\ncalculated under the methodology described\nabove as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n                                              \n   Table 33: Interest Rate Sensitivity        \n   Analysis                                   \n                                              \n                                              \n                December         December     \n                31, 2023         31, 2022     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  projected                                   \n  baseline                                    \n  net                                         \n  interest                                    \n  income:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis              0.7  %           0.4  %  \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis              0.8              0.8     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis          0.4              0.4     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis         -0.5             -0.7     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis             -0.9             -1.3     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis             -2.0             -2.6     \n  points                                      \n  Estimated                                   \n  impact on                                   \n  economic                                    \n  value of                                    \n  equity:                                     \n  +200                                        \n  basis             -8.4             -4.3     \n  points                                      \n  +100                                        \n  basis             -3.7             -1.5     \n  points                                      \n  +50 basis         -1.8             -0.7     \n  points                                      \n  \u201350 basis          1.6              0.4     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013100                                        \n  basis              2.9              0.6     \n  points                                      \n  \u2013200                                        \n  basis              4.0             -0.2     \n  points                                      \n                                              \nIn addition to these industry standard\nmeasures, we also consider the potential\nimpact of alternative interest rate scenarios,\nsuch as larger rate shocks, higher than +/-\n200 bps, as well as steepening and flattening\nyield curve scenarios in our internal interest\nrate risk management decisions. We also\nregularly review the sensitivity of our\ninterest rate risk metrics to changes in our\nkey modeling assumptions, such as our loan and\ndeposit balance forecasts, mortgage\nprepayments and deposit repricing.\n                                              \n  Limitations of Market Risk Measures         \n                                              \nThe interest rate risk models that we use in\nderiving these measures incorporate\ncontractual information, internally-developed\nassumptions and proprietary modeling\nmethodologies, which project borrower and\ndepositor behavior patterns in certain\ninterest rate environments. Other market\ninputs, such as interest rates, market prices\nand interest rate volatility, are also\ncritical components of our interest rate risk\nmeasures. We regularly evaluate, update and\nenhance these assumptions, models and\nanalytical tools as we believe appropriate to\nreflect our best assessment of the market\nenvironment and the expected behavior patterns\nof our existing assets and liabilities.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in any\nmethodology used to estimate the exposure to\nchanges in market interest rates. The\nsensitivity analysis described above\ncontemplates only certain movements in\ninterest rates and is performed at a\nparticular point in time based on our existing\nbalance sheet and, in some cases, expected\nfuture business growth and funding mix\nassumptions. The strategic actions that\nmanagement may take to manage our balance\nsheet may differ significantly from our\nprojections, which could cause our actual\nearnings and economic value of equity\nsensitivities to differ substantially from the\nabove sensitivity analysis.\n\nFor further information on our interest rate\nexposures, see \u201cItem 8.

We are exposed to foreign exchange\nrisk primarily from the intercompany funding\ndenominated in pound sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) and the\nCanadian dollar (\u201cCAD\u201d) that we provide to our\nbusinesses in the U.K. and Canada and net\nequity investments in those businesses. We are\nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk due to\nchanges in the dollar-denominated value of\nfuture earnings and cash flows from our\nforeign operations and from our Euro\n(\u201cEUR\u201d)-denominated borrowings.\n\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany\nfunding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose\nour earnings to foreign exchange transaction\nrisk. We manage these transaction risks by\nusing forward foreign currency derivatives and\ncross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures.\nWe measure our foreign exchange transaction\nrisk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar\nappreciation shock against the value of the\nnon-dollar denominated intercompany funding\nand EUR-denominated borrowings and their\nrelated hedges, which shows the impact to our\nearnings from foreign exchange risk. Our\nnominal intercompany funding outstanding was\n973 million GBP and 785 million GBP as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and\n1.6 billion CAD and 1.7 billion CAD as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our\nnominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding\nwere 1.3 billion EUR as of both December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\n\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign\noperations expose our balance sheet and\ncapital ratios to translation risk in AOCI. We\nmanage our translation risk by entering into\nforeign currency derivatives designated as net\ninvestment hedges. We measure these exposures\nby applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation\nshock, which we believe approximates a\nsignificant adverse shock over a one-year time\nhorizon, against the value of the equity\ninvested in our foreign operations net of\nrelated net investment hedges where\napplicable. Our gross equity exposures in our\nU.K. and Canadian operations were 2.2 billion\nGBP and 1.9 billion GBP as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, and 2.4 billion\nCAD and 2.2 billion CAD as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nAs a result of our derivative management\nactivities, we believe our net exposure to\nforeign exchange risk is minimal.

We offset the majority of the market\nrisk of these customer accommodation\nderivatives by entering into offsetting\nderivatives transactions with other\ncounterparties. We use value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d)\nas the primary method to measure the market\nrisk in our customer accommodation derivative\nactivities on a daily basis. VaR is a\nstatistical risk measure used to estimate the\npotential loss from movements observed in the\nrecent market environment. We employ a\nhistorical simulation approach using the most\nrecent 500 business days and use a 99 percent\nconfidence level and a holding period of one\nbusiness day.

Internal control over\nfinancial reporting is a process designed by,\nor under the supervision of, the Company\u2019s\nprincipal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, and effected by the Company\u2019s Board\nof Directors, management and other personnel,\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for\nexternal reporting purposes in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nCapital One\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions\nare recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that the Company\u2019s receipts\nand expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the\nCompany\u2019s management and directors; and (iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use or disposition of the\nCompany\u2019s assets that could have a material\neffect on its financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n\nManagement conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on the framework in\n\u201c2013 Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework\u201d\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission\n(\u201cCOSO\u201d), commonly referred to as the \u201c2013\nFramework.\u201d\n\nBased on this assessment, management concluded\nthat, as of December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting was\neffective based on the criteria established by\nCOSO in the 2013 Framework. Additionally,\nbased upon management\u2019s assessment, the\nCompany determined that there were no material\nweaknesses in its internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, has been audited by Ernst &\nYoung LLP, an independent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in their\naccompanying report, which expresses an\nunqualified opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023.\n                                     \n  /s/ RICHARD D.

Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\nare required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control\nbased on the assessed risk, and performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control\nOver Financial Reporting\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to\npermit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures\nof the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n                        \n  /s/Ernst & Young LLP  \n  Tysons, Virginia      \n  February 22, 2024     \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                        \n                                              \n  123    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC    \n   ACCOUNTING FIRM                            \n                                              \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors\nof Capital One Financial Corporation\n                                              \n   Opinion on the Financial Statements        \n                                              \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets of Capital One Financial\nCorporation (the Company) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of income, comprehensive income,\nchanges in stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2023, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated\nfinancial statements\u201d).

Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements.

McLean, Virginia, is a\ndiversified financial services holding company\nwith banking and non-banking subsidiaries.\nCapital One Financial Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cCapital One\u201d)\noffer a broad array of financial products and\nservices to consumers, small businesses and\ncommercial clients through digital channels,\nbranch locations, caf\u00e9s and other distribution\nchannels.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Capital One Financial\nCorporation\u2019s principal operating subsidiary\nwas Capital One, National Association\n(\u201cCONA\u201d). On October 1, 2022, the Company\ncomplet ed the merger of Capital One Bank\n(USA), National Association (\u201cCOBNA\u201d), with\nand into CONA, with CONA as the surviving\nentity (the \u201cBank Merger\u201d).\nThe Company is hereafter collectively referred\nto as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour.\u201d References to the\n\u201cBank\u201d shall mean and refer to (i) CONA from\nand after the Bank Merger and (ii) CONA and\nCOBNA collectively prior to the Bank Merger.\nWe also offer products outside of the United\nStates of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) principally through\nCapital One (Europe) plc (\u201cCOEP\u201d), an indirect\nsubsidiary of CONA organized and located in\nthe United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), and through a\nbranch of CONA in Canada. Both COEP and our\nCanadian branch of CONA have the authority to\nprovide credit card loans.\nOur principal operations are organized for\nmanagement reporting purposes into threemajor\nbusiness segments, which are defined primarily\nbased on the products and services provided or\nthe types of customer served: Credit Card,\nConsumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We\nprovide details on our business segments, the\nintegration of any recent material\nacquisitions into our business segments, and\nthe allocation methodologies and accounting\npolicies used to derive our business segment\nresults in \u201cNote 17\u2014Business Segments and\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements have been prepared in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles\nin the U.S. (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of\nthe consolidated financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. GAAP requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and in the related\ndisclosures. These estimates are based on\ninformation available as of the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements. While\nmanagement makes its best judgments, actual\namounts or results could differ from these\nestimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include\nthe accounts of Capital One Financial\nCorporation and all other entities in which we\nhave a controlling financial interest. We\ndetermine whether we have a controlling\nfinancial interest in an entity by first\nevaluating whether the entity is a voting\ninterest entity (\u201cVOE\u201d) or a variable interest\nentity (\u201cVIE\u201d). All significant intercompany\naccount balances and transactions have been\neliminated.\nVoting Interest Entities\nVOEs are entities that have sufficient equity\nand provide the equity investors voting rights\nthat give them the power to make significant\ndecisions relating to the entity\u2019s operations.\nSince a controlling financial interest in an\nentity is typically obtained through ownership\nof a majority voting interest, we consolidate\nour majority-owned subsidiaries and other\nvoting interest entities in which we hold,\ndirectly or indirectly, more than 50% of the\nvoting rights or where we exercise control\nthrough other contractual rights.\nInvestments in which we do not hold a\ncontrolling financial interest but have\nsignificant influence over the entity\u2019s\nfinancial and operating decisions are\naccounted for under the equity method. If we\ndo not have significant influence, we measure\nequity investments at fair value with changes\nin fair value recorded through net income,\nexcept those that do not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value (for which a\nmeasurement alternative is applied). We report\nequity investments in other assets on our\nconsolidated balance sheets and include our\nshare of income or loss and dividends from\nthose investments in other non-interest income\nin our consolidated statements of income.The\ncarrying value of other investments included\nin other assets, excluding tax advantage\ninvestments, totaled $ 1.0billion and $\n901million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, which primarily included equity\ninvestments measured using the alternative\nmeasurement method and equity method\ninvestments.

The entity that is\ndeemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE is\nrequired to consolidate the VIE. An entity is\ndeemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE\nif that entity has both (i) the power to\ndirect the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic\nperformance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb\nlosses or the right to receive benefits that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE.\nIn determining whether we are the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE, we consider both\nqualitative and quantitative factors regarding\nthe nature, size and form of our involvement\nwith the VIE, such as our role in establishing\nthe VIE and our ongoing rights and\nresponsibilities; our economic interests,\nincluding debt and equity investments,\nservicing fees and other arrangements deemed\nto be variable interests in the VIE; the\ndesign of the VIE, including the\ncapitalization structure, subordination of\ninterests, payment priority, relative share of\ninterests held across various classes within\nthe VIE\u2019s capital structure and the reasons\nwhy the interests are held by us.\nWe perform on-going reassessments to evaluate\nwhether changes in an entity\u2019s capital\nstructure or changes in the nature of our\ninvolvement with the entity result in a change\nto the VIE designation or a change to our\nconsolidation conclusion. See \u201cNote 5\u2014Variable\nInterest Entities and Securitizations\u201d for\nfurther details.\nBalance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets\nand Liabilities\nDerivative contracts that we execute\nbilaterally in the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d)\nmarket or are centrally cleared are generally\ngoverned by enforceable master netting\nagreements where we generally have the right\nto offset exposure with the same counterparty.\nEither counterparty can generally request to\nnet settle all contracts through a single\npayment upon default on, or termination of,\nany one contract. We elect to offset the\nderivative assets and liabilities under master\nnetting agreements for balance sheet\npresentation where a right of setoff exists.\nFor derivative contracts entered into under\nmaster netting agreements for which we have\nnot been able to confirm the enforceability of\nthe setoff rights, or those not subject to\nmaster netting agreements, we do not offset\nour derivative positions for balance sheet\npresentation. See \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities\u201d for more\ndetails.\nWe also elect to present securities purchased\nor sold under resale or repurchase agreements\non a net basis when a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement exists and other\napplicable criteria are met. Security\ncollateral received from or pledged to the\ncounterparties are not eligible for netting\nand are presented gross in our consolidated\nbalance sheet. See \u201cNote 8\u2014Deposits and\nBorrowings\u201d and \u201cNote 9\u2014Derivative Instruments\nand Hedging Activities\u201d for more details.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and due\nfrom banks, interest-bearing deposits and\nother short-term investments, all of which, if\napplicable, have stated maturities of three\nmonths or less when acquired.\nSecurities Resale and Repurchase Agreements\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\nand securities loaned or sold under agreements\nto repurchase, principally U.S. government and\nagency obligations, are not accounted for as\nsales but as collateralized financing\ntransactions and recorded at the amounts at\nwhich the securities were acquired or sold,\nplus accrued interest. We continually monitor\nthe market value of these securities and\ndeliver additional collateral to or obtain\nadditional collateral from counterparties, as\nappropriate.

The accounting\nand measurement framework for our investment\nsecurities differs depending on the security\nclassification.\nWe classify securities as available for sale\nor held to maturity based on our investment\nstrategy and management\u2019s assessment of our\nintent and ability to hold the securities\nuntil maturity. We did not have any securities\nthat were classified as held to maturity as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nWe report securities available for sale on our\nconsolidated balance sheets at fair value. The\namortized cost of investment securities\nreflects the amount for which the security was\nacquired, adjusted for accrued interest,\namortization of premiums, discounts, and net\ndeferred fees and costs, any applicable fair\nvalue hedge accounting adjustments, collection\nof cash, and charge-offs. Unrealized gains or\nlosses are recorded, net of tax, as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (\u201cAOCI\u201d). Unamortized premiums,\ndiscounts and other basis adjustments for\navailable for sale securities are generally\nrecognized in interest income over the\ncontractual lives of the securities using the\ninterest method. However, premiums on certain\ncallable investment securities are amortized\nto the earliest call date. We record purchases\nand sales of investment securities available\nfor sale on a trade date basis. Realized gains\nor losses from the sale of debt securities are\ncomputed using the first-in first-out method\nof identification, and are included in non-\ninterest income in our consolidated statements\nof income. We elect to present accrued\ninterest for securities available for sale\nwithin interest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nAn individual debt security is impaired when\nthe fair value of the security is less than\nits amortized cost. If we intend to sell an\navailable for sale security in an unrealized\nloss position or it is more likely than not\nthat we will be required to sell the security\nprior to recovery of its amortized cost basis,\nany allowance for credit losses is reversed\nthrough our provision for credit losses and\nthe difference between the amortized cost\nbasis of the security and its fair value is\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nFor impaired debt securities that we have both\nthe intent and ability to hold, the securities\nare evaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. The allowance for credit losses on our\ninvestment securities is recognized through\nour provision for credit losses and limited by\nthe unrealized losses of a security measured\nas the difference between the security\u2019s\namortized cost and fair value. See further\ndiscussion below under the \u201cAllowance for\nCredit Losses - Available for Sale Investment\nSecurities\u201d section of this Note.\nWe charge off any portion of an investment\nsecurity that we determine is uncollectible.\nThe amortized cost basis, excluding accrued\ninterest, is charged off through the allowance\nfor credit losses. Accrued interest is charged\noff as a reduction to interest income.\nRecoveries of previously charged off principal\namounts are recognized in our provision for\ncredit losses when received.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Available for\nSale Investment Securities\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\nthat represents management\u2019s current estimate\nof expected credit losses over the contractual\nterms of our investment securities classified\nas available for sale. When an investment\nsecurity available for sale is impaired due to\ncredit factors, we recognize that impairment\nthrough the provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and\ncorrespondingly establish an allowance for\ncredit losses on our consolidated balance\nsheets. Credit losses recognized in the\nallowance for credit losses are limited to the\namount by which the investment security\u2019s\namortized cost basis exceeds its fair value.\nInvestment securities in unrealized gain\npositions do not have any allowance for credit\nlosses as the investment security could be\nsold at its fair value to prevent realization\nof any credit losses. We exclude accrued\ninterest from the fair value and amortized\ncost basis of an investment security for\npurposes of measuring impairment. Charge-offs\nof uncollectible amounts of investment\nsecurities are deducted from the allowance for\ncredit losses.\nFor certain of our securities available for\nsale, we have determined that there is no risk\nof impairment due to credit factors. These\ninvestment securities include high quality\ndebt instruments that are issued and\nguaranteed by the United States government and\nits agencies, certain government-sponsored\nenterprises, and certain foreign sovereign\ngovernments or\n                                              \n  135    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nsupranational organizations. Management\nperforms periodic assessments to reevaluate\nthis conclusion by considering any changes in\nhistorical losses, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\n\nWe evaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at\nthe individual security level and determine\nwhether any portion of the decline in fair\nvalue is due to a credit loss. We make this\ndetermination through the use of quantitative\nand qualitative analyses. Our qualitative\nanalysis includes factors such as the extent\nto which fair value is less than amortized\ncost, any changes in the security\u2019s credit\nrating, past defaults or delayed payments, and\nadverse conditions impacting the security or\nissuer. A credit loss exists to the extent\nthat management does not expect to recover the\namortized cost basis.\n\nFor investment securities which require\nfurther assessment, we perform a quantitative\nanalysis using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology and compare the present value of\nexpected future cash flows to the security\u2019s\namortized cost basis. Projected future cash\nflows reflect management\u2019s best estimate and\nare based on our understanding of past events,\ncurrent conditions, reasonable and supportable\nforecasts, and are discounted by the\nsecurity\u2019s effective interest rate adjusted\nfor prepayments. The allowance for credit\nlosses for investment securities reflects the\ndifference by which the amortized cost basis\nexceeds the present value of future cash flows\nand is limited to the amount by which the\nsecurity\u2019s amortized cost exceeds its fair\nvalue. See \u201cNote 2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for\nadditional information.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for\ninvestment, including loans held in our\nconsolidated securitization trusts, and loans\nheld for sale and is divided into three\nportfolio segments: credit card, consumer\nbanking and commercial banking loans. Credit\ncard loans consist of domestic and\ninternational credit card loans. Consumer\nbanking loans consist of auto and retail\nbanking loans. Commercial banking loans\nconsist of commercial and multifamily real\nestate loans as well as commercial and\nindustrial loans.\nLoan Classification\nWe classify loans as held for investment or\nheld for sale based on our investment strategy\nand management\u2019s intent and ability with\nregard to the loans, which may change over\ntime. The accounting and measurement framework\nfor loans differs depending on the loan\nclassification, whether we elect the fair\nvalue option, whether the loans are originated\nor purchased and whether purchased loans are\nconsidered to have experienced a more-than-\ninsignificant deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination. The presentation within the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows is based\non management\u2019s intent at acquisition or\norigination. Cash flows related to loans that\nare acquired or originated with the intent to\nhold for investment are included in cash flows\nfrom investing activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows. Cash flows related\nto loans that are acquired or originated with\nthe intent to sell are included in cash flows\nfrom operating activities on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.\nLoans Held for Investment\nLoans that we have the ability and intent to\nhold for the foreseeable future and loans\nassociated with consolidated securitization\ntransactions are classified as held for\ninvestment. Loans classified as held for\ninvestment, except for credit card loans, are\nreported at their amortized cost basis,\nexcluding accrued interest. For these loans,\nwe elect to present accrued interest within\ninterest receivable on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For credit card loans\nclassified as held for investment, earned\nfinance charges and fees are included in\neither loans held for investment (if they have\nbeen billed to the customer) or interest\nreceivable (if they have not yet been billed\nto the customer).\nInterest income is recognized on performing\nloans on an accrual basis. We defer loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts on originated loans, premiums and\ndiscounts on purchased loans and loan\ncommitment fees. We recognize these amounts in\ninterest income as yield adjustments over the\nlife of the loan and/or commitment period\nusing the interest method. For credit card\nloans, loan origination fees and direct loan\norigination costs are amortized on a straight-\nline basis over a 12-month period. The\namortized cost of loans held for investment is\nsubject to our allowance for credit losses\nmethodology described below under the\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\u201d section of this Note.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans that we intend to sell or for which we\ndo not have the ability and intent to hold for\nthe foreseeable future are classified as held\nfor sale. Multifamily commercial real estate\nloans originated with the intent to sell to\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises\n                                              \n  136    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nare accounted for under the fair value option.\nWe elect the fair value option on these loans\nas part of our management of interest rate\nrisk along with the corresponding forward sale\ncommitments. Loan origination fees and direct\nloan origination costs are recognized as\nincurred and are reported in other non-\ninterest income in the consolidated statements\nof income. Interest income is calculated based\non the loan's stated rate of interest and is\nreported in interest income in the\nconsolidated statements of income. Fair value\nadjustments are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\n\nAll other loans classified as held for sale\nare recorded at the lower of cost or fair\nvalue. Loan origination fees, direct loan\norigination costs and any discounts and\npremiums are deferred until the loan is sold\nand are then recognized as part of the total\ngain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans\nheld for sale is generally determined on an\naggregate portfolio basis for each loan type,\nhowever, fair value may be determined on an\nindividual basis when circumstances warrant.\nFair value adjustments are recorded in other\nnon-interest income in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\n\nIf a loan is transferred from held for\ninvestment to held for sale, then on the\ntransfer date, any decline in fair value\nrelated to credit is recorded as a charge-off\nand any remaining allowance for credit losses\nis reversed through our provision for credit\nlosses. The loan is then reclassified to held\nfor sale at its amortized cost at the date of\nthe transfer. A valuation allowance is\nestablished, if needed, such that the loan\nheld for sale is recorded at the lower of cost\nor fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we\nreport write-downs or recoveries in fair value\nup to the carrying value at the date of\ntransfer and realized gains or losses on loans\nheld for sale in our consolidated statements\nof income as a component of other non-interest\nincome. We calculate the gain or loss on loan\nsales as the difference between the proceeds\nreceived and the carrying value of the loans\nsold, net of the fair value of any interests\nretained.\n\nLoans Acquired\n\nAll purchased loans, including loans\ntransferred in a business combination, are\ninitially recorded at fair value, which\nincludes consideration of expected future\nlosses, as of the date of the acquisition. To\ndetermine the fair value of loans at\nacquisition, we estimate discounted\ncontractual cash flows due using an observable\nmarket rate of interest, when available,\nadjusted for factors that a market participant\nwould consider in determining fair value. In\ndetermining fair value, contractual cash flows\nare adjusted to include prepayment estimates\nbased upon historical payment trends,\nforecasted default rates and loss severities\nand other relevant factors. The difference\nbetween the fair value and the contractual\ncash flows is recorded as a loan premium or\ndiscount, which may relate to either credit or\nnon-credit factors, at acquisition.\n\nWe account for purchased loans under the\naccounting guidance for purchased financial\nassets with credit deterioration when, at the\ntime of purchase, the loans have experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination. These loans\nare herein referred to as purchased credit-\ndeteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d) loans and require the\nrecognition of an allowance for credit losses\nat the time of acquisition.\n\nWe recognize an allowance for credit losses on\npurchased loans that have not experienced a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since origination at the time\nof purchase through earnings in a manner that\nis consistent with originated loans. The\npolicies relating to the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans is described below in the\n\u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\u201d section of this Note.\nLoan Modifications and Restructurings\nCapital One adopted Accounting Standards\nUpdate (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2022-02, Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures on January 1, 2023, and elected\nthe modified retrospective adoption method.\nThe ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for\ntroubled debt restructurings, and establishes\ndisclosure requirements for certain loan\nrefinancings and restructurings for borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty. We provide\ninformation on modified loans, including the\nperformance of those loans subsequent to\nmodification, in \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans.\u201d\n\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide modifications to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty to improve\nlong-term collectability of the loan and to\navoid the need for foreclosure or repossession\nof collateral, if any. Loan modifications to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty in\nthe form of principal forgiveness, an interest\nrate reduction, a delay in payment, including\npayment deferrals or a term extension are\nreported as a Financial Difficulty\nModification (\u201cFDM\u201d). As restructurings\noffered to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty are typically not at market terms,\nFDMs are generally accounted for as a\ncontinuation of the existing loan.

These loan\nmodifications typically include short-term\npayment deferrals, an extension of the loan\nterm, a reduction in the interest rate, a\nreduction in the loan balance, or a\ncombination of these modifications. See \u201cNote\n3\u2014Loans\u201d for additional information on our\nloan modifications and restructurings.\nDelinquent and Nonperforming Loans\nThe entire balance of a loan is considered\ncontractually delinquent if the minimum\nrequired payment is not received by the first\nstatement cycle date equal to or following the\ndue date specified on the customer\u2019s billing\nstatement. Delinquency is reported on loans\nthat are 30or more days past due. Interest and\nfees continue to accrue on past due loans\nuntil the date the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, if applicable. For loan\nmodifications, delinquency and nonaccrual\nstatus are reported in accordance with the\nrevised terms of the loans. We generally place\nconsumer and commercial loans on nonaccrual\nstatus when we believe the collectability of\ninterest and principal is not reasonably\nassured.\n\nNonperforming loans generally include loans\nthat have been placed on nonaccrual status.\nLoans classified as held for sale are excluded\nfrom nonperforming classification\nconsideration.\n\nOur policies for classifying loans as\nnonperforming, by loan category, are as\nfollows:\n\n\u2022 C redit card loans: As permitted by\nregulatory guidance issued by the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council\n(\u201cFFIEC\u201d), our policy is generally to exempt\ncredit card loans from being classified as\nnonperforming, as these loans are generally\ncharged off in the period the account becomes\n180days past due. Consistent with industry\nconventions, we generally continue to accrue\ninterest and fees on delinquent credit card\nloans until the loans are charged off, though\nany amounts deemed uncollectible are reserved\nfor in our allowance for credit losses.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We classify consumer\nbanking loans as nonperforming when we\ndetermine that the collectability of all\ninterest and principal on the loan is not\nreasonably assured, which is generally when\nthe loan becomes 90days past due.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans : We classify\ncommercial banking loans as nonperforming as\nof the date we determine that the\ncollectability of all interest and principal\non the loan is not reasonably assured.\n\n\u2022 Modified loans and troubled debt\nrestructurings: Modified loans, including TDRs\nfor periods ending on or before December 31,\n2022 and FDMs for periods beginning on or\nafter January 1, 2023, that are current at the\ntime of the restructuring remain in accrual\nstatus if there is demonstrated performance\nprior to the restructuring and continued\nperformance under the modified terms is\nexpected. Otherwise, the modified loan is\nclassified as nonperforming.\n\nInterest and fees accrued but not collected at\nthe date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status\nare reversed against earnings. In addition,\nthe amortization of deferred loan fees, costs,\npremiums and discounts is suspended. Interest\nand fee income are subsequently recognized\nonly upon the receipt of cash payments.\nHowever, if there is doubt regarding the\nultimate collectability of loan principal,\ncash received is generally applied against the\nprincipal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual\nloans are generally returned to accrual status\nwhen all principal and interest is current and\nrepayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest is reasonably assured,\nor when the loan is both well-secured and in\nthe process of collection and collectability\nis no longer doubtful.\n                                              \n  138    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nCharge-Offs\nWe charge off loans when we determine that the\nloan is uncollectible. The amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, is charged\noff as a reduction to the allowance for credit\nlosses based on the time frames presented\nbelow. Accrued interest on loans other than\ncredit card loans determined to be\nuncollectible is reversed as a reduction of\ninterest income when the loan is classified as\nnonperforming. For credit card loans, accrued\ninterest is charged off simultaneously with\nthe charge-off of other components of\namortized cost and as a reduction of interest\nincome. When received, recoveries of\npreviously charged off amounts are recorded as\nan increase to the allowance for credit losses\n(see the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nHeld for Investment\u201d section of this Note for\ninformation on how we account for expected\nrecoveries). Costs to recover charged off\nloans are recorded as collection expense and\nincluded in our consolidated statements of\nincome as a component of other non-interest\nexpense as incurred. Our charge-off time\nframes by loan type are presented below.\n\n\u2022 Credit card loans : We generally charge off\ncredit card loans in the period the account\nbecomes 180days past due. We charge off\ndelinquent credit card loans for which\nrevolving privileges have been revoked as part\nof loan workout when the account becomes\n120days past due. Credit card loans in\nbankruptcy are generally charged off by the\nend of the month following 30days after the\nreceipt of a complete bankruptcy notification\nfrom the bankruptcy court. Credit card loans\nof deceased account holders are generally\ncharged off 5days after receipt of\nnotification.\n\n\u2022 Consumer banking loans: We generally charge\noff consumer banking loans at the earlier of\nthe date when the account is a specified\nnumber of days past due or upon repossession\nof the underlying collateral. Our charge-off\nperiod for auto loans is 120days past due.\nSmall business banking loans generally charge\noff at 120days past due or based on the date\nthe amortized cost basis is deemed\nuncollectible. Auto loans that have not been\npreviously charged off where the borrower has\nfiled for bankruptcy and the loan has not been\nreaffirmed charge off in the period that is\n60days from the bankruptcy notification date,\nregardless of delinquency status. Auto loans\nthat have not been previously charged off and\nhave been discharged under Chapter 7\nbankruptcy are charged off at the end of the\nmonth in which the bankruptcy discharge\noccurs. Remaining consumer loans generally are\ncharged off within 40days of receipt of\nnotification from the bankruptcy court. In\ncertain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is\nwritten down to the collateral value and the\ncharged off amount is reported as principal\nreduction. Impairment is determined using the\npresent value of expected cash flows or a\ncollateral evaluation for certain auto loans\nwhere the collateral value is lower than the\namortized cost. Consumer loans of deceased\naccount holders are charged off by the end of\nthe month following 60days of receipt of\nnotification.\n\n\u2022 Commercial banking loans: We charge off\ncommercial loans in the period we determine\nthat the amortized cost basis is\nuncollectible.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for\nInvestment\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses\n(\u201callowance\u201d) that represents management\u2019s\ncurrent estimate of expected credit losses\nover the contractual terms of our loans held\nfor investment. We measure the allowance on a\nquarterly basis through consideration of past\nevents, including historical experience,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts.\n\nWe measure current expected credit losses\n(\u201cCECL\u201d) over the contractual terms of our\nloans. The contractual terms are adjusted for\nexpected prepayments but are not extended for\nrenewals or extensions, except when an\nextension or renewal arises from a borrower\noption that is not unconditionally\ncancellable.\n\nWe aggregate loans sharing similar risk\ncharacteristics into pools for purposes of\nmeasuring expected credit losses. Pools are\nreassessed periodically to confirm that all\nloans within each pool continue to share\nsimilar risk characteristics. Expected credit\nlosses for loans that do not share similar\nrisk characteristics with other financial\nassets are measured individually.\n\nExpected recoveries of amounts previously\ncharged off or expected to be charged off are\nrecognized within the allowance, with a\ncorresponding reduction to our provision for\ncredit losses. At times expected recoveries\nmay result in a negative allowance. We limit\nthe allowance recovery expectations to amounts\npreviously charged off and expected to be\ncharged off. Charge-offs of uncollectible\namounts result in a reduction to the allowance\nand recoveries of previously charged off\namounts result in an increase to the\nallowance.\n                                              \n  139    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWhen developing an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information, or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Judgment is applied to\nthe development and duration of reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts used in our estimation\nof lifetime losses. We estimate expected\ncredit losses over the duration of those\nforecasts and then revert, on a rational and\nsystematic basis, to historical losses at each\nrelevant loss component of the estimate.\nExpected losses for contractual terms\nextending beyond the reasonable and\nsupportable forecast and reversion periods are\nbased on those historical losses.\n\nManagement will consider and may qualitatively\nadjust for conditions, changes and trends in\nloan portfolios that may not be captured in\nmodeled results. These adjustments are\nreferred to as qualitative factors and\nrepresent management\u2019s judgment of the\nimprecision and risks inherent in the\nprocesses and assumptions used in establishing\nthe allowance for credit losses. Management\u2019s\njudgment may involve an assessment of current\nand forward-looking conditions including but\nnot limited to changes in lending policies and\nprocedures, nature and volume of the\nportfolio, external factors, and uncertainty\nas it relates to economic, model or forecast\nrisks, where not already captured in the\nmodeled results.\n\nExpected credit losses for collateral-\ndependent loans are based on the fair value of\nthe underlying collateral. When we intend to\nliquidate the collateral, the fair value of\nthe collateral is adjusted for expected costs\nto sell. A loan is deemed to be a collateral-\ndependent loan when (i) we determine\nforeclosure or repossession of the underlying\ncollateral is probable, or (ii) foreclosure or\nrepossession is not probable, but the borrower\nis experiencing financial difficulty and we\nexpect repayment to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the\ncollateral. The allowance for a collateral-\ndependent loan reflects the difference between\nthe loan\u2019s amortized cost basis and the fair\nvalue (less selling costs, where applicable)\nof the loan\u2019s underlying collateral.\n\nOur credit card and consumer banking loan\nportfolios consist of smaller-balance,\nhomogeneous loans. The consumer banking loan\nportfolio is divided into two primary\nportfolio segments: auto loans and retail\nbanking loans. We assess our credit card and\nconsumer banking loan portfolios based on\ncommon risk characteristics, such as\norigination year, contract type, interest\nrate, borrower credit score and geography. The\ncommercial banking loan portfolio is primarily\ncomposed of larger-balance, non-homogeneous\nloans. These loans are subject to reviews that\nresult in internal risk ratings. In assessing\nthe risk rating of a particular commercial\nbanking loan, among the factors we consider\nare the financial condition of the borrower,\ngeography, collateral performance, historical\nloss experience and industry-specific\ninformation that management believes is\nrelevant in determining and measuring expected\ncredit losses. Subjective assessment and\ninterpretation are involved. Emphasizing one\nfactor over another or considering additional\nfactors could impact the risk rating assigned\nto that commercial banking loan.\n\nFor consumer banking and commercial banking\nloans, the contractual period typically does\nnot include renewals or extensions because the\nrenewals and extensions are generally not at\nthe borrower\u2019s exclusive option to exercise.\nThe undrawn credit exposure associated with\nour credit card loans is unconditionally\ncancellable. For this reason, expected credit\nlosses are measured based only on the drawn\nbalance at each quarterly measurement date and\nnot on the undrawn exposure. Because credit\ncard loans do not have a defined contractual\nlife, management estimates both the volume and\napplication of payments to determine a\ncontractual life of the drawn balance at the\nmeasurement date over which expected credit\nlosses are developed for credit card loans.\n\nFor consumer banking and commercial banking\nloans, we have made a policy election to not\nmeasure an allowance on accrued interest for\nloans held for investment because we reverse\nuncollectible accrued interest in a timely\nmanner. See the \u201cDelinquent and Nonperforming\nLoans\u201d and \u201cCharge-Offs - Loans\u201d sections of\nthis Note for information on what we consider\ntimely. For credit card loans, we do not make\nthis election, and we reserve for\nuncollectible accrued interest relating to\ncredit card loans in the allowance.\n                                              \n  140    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe allowance related to credit card and\nconsumer banking loans assessed on a pooled\nbasis is based on a modeled calculation, which\nis supplemented by management judgment as\ndescribed above. Because of the homogeneous\nnature of our consumer loan portfolios, the\nallowance is based on the aggregated portfolio\nsegment evaluations. The allowance is\nestablished through a process that begins with\nestimates of historical losses in each pool\nbased upon various statistical analyses, with\nadjustments for current conditions and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions, which includes expected economic\nconditions. Loss forecast models are utilized\nto estimate expected credit losses and\nconsider several portfolio indicators\nincluding, but not limited to, expected\neconomic conditions, historical loss\nexperience, account seasoning, the value of\ncollateral underlying secured loans, estimated\nforeclosures or defaults based on observable\ntrends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings,\nunemployment, borrower credit scores and\ngeneral business trends. Management also\nconsiders an evaluation of overall portfolio\ncredit quality based on indicators such as\nchanges in our credit evaluation, underwriting\nand collection management policies, the effect\nof other external factors such as competition\nand legal and regulatory requirements, general\neconomic conditions and business trends, and\nuncertainties in forecasting and modeling\ntechniques used in estimating our allowance.\n\nThe allowance related to commercial banking\nloans assessed on a pooled basis is based on\nour historical loss experience for loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics and consideration\nof the current credit quality of the\nportfolio, which is supplemented by management\njudgment as described above. These are\nadjusted for current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of\nconditions likely to cause future losses which\nvary from historical levels. We apply internal\nrisk ratings to commercial banking loans,\nwhich we use to assess credit quality and\nderive a total loss estimate based on an\nestimated probability of default (\u201cdefault\nrate\u201d) and loss given default (\u201closs\nseverity\u201d). Management may also apply judgment\nto adjust the loss factors derived, taking\ninto consideration both quantitative and\nqualitative factors, including general\neconomic conditions, industry-specific and\ngeographic trends, portfolio concentrations,\ntrends in internal credit quality indicators,\nand current and past underwriting standards\nthat have occurred but are not yet reflected\nin the historical data underlying our loss\nestimates.\n\nThe allowance related to smaller-balance\nhomogeneous credit card and consumer banking\nloans whose terms have been modified is\ncalculated on a pool basis using historical\nloss experience, adjusted for current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of conditions likely to cause future\nlosses which vary from historical levels for\nthe respective class of assets. The allowance\nrelated to consumer banking loans that are\nassessed at a loan-level is determined based\non key considerations that include the\nborrower\u2019s overall financial condition,\nresources and payment history, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, and when applicable, the estimated\nrealizable value of any collateral. The\nallowance related to commercial banking loans\nthat are assessed at a loan-level is generally\ndetermined in accordance with our policy for\nestimating expected credit losses for\ncollateral-dependent loans as described above.\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures\nIn addition to the allowance, we also measure\nexpected credit losses related to unfunded\nlending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable in our Commercial\nBanking business. This reserve is measured\nusing the same measurement objectives as the\nallowance for loans held for investment and is\nrecorded within other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. These commitments\nare segregated by risk according to our\ninternal risk rating scale, which we use to\nassess credit quality and derive an expected\ncredit loss estimate. We assess these risk\nclassifications, taking into consideration\nboth quantitative and qualitative factors,\nincluding historical loss experience, adjusted\nfor current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of conditions likely to\ncause future losses which vary from historical\nlevels, and utilization assumptions to\nestimate the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. Expected credit losses are not\nmeasured on unfunded lending commitments that\nare unconditionally cancellable, including all\nof our unfunded credit card and consumer\nbanking lending commitments and certain of our\nunfunded commercial banking lending\ncommitments.\n\nDetermining the appropriateness of the\nallowance and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is complex and requires judgment\nby management about the effect of matters that\nare inherently uncertain. Subsequent\nevaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of\nthe factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments in future\nperiods. See \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments\u201d for additional information.\n                                              \n  141    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nSecuritization of Loans\nOur loan securitization activities primarily\ninvolve the securitization of credit card and\nauto loans, which provides a source of funding\nfor us. Loan securitization involves the\ntransfer of a pool of loan receivables from\nour portfolio to a trust. The trust then sells\nundivided interests in the pool of loan\nreceivables to third-party investors through\nthe issuance of debt securities and transfers\nthe proceeds from the debt issuance to us as\nconsideration for the loan receivables\ntransferred. The debt securities are\ncollateralized by the loan receivables\ntransferred from our portfolio. We remove\nloans from our consolidated balance sheets if\nsecuritizations qualify as sales to\nunconsolidated VIEs, recognize assets retained\nand liabilities assumed at fair value and\nrecord a gain or loss on the transferred\nloans. Alternatively, if the transfer does not\nqualify as a sale but instead is considered a\nsecured borrowing, the assets will remain on\nour consolidated balance sheets with an\noffsetting liability recognized for the amount\nof proceeds received.See \u201cNote 5\u2014Variable\nInterest Entities and Securitizations\u201d for\nadditional details.\nPremises, Equipment and Leases\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold\nimprovements, are carried at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and amortization.\nLand is carried at cost.

Depreciation and\namortization expenses are calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets. Useful lives for premises\nand equipment are generally estimated as\nfollows:\n                                              \n  Premises and          Useful Lives          \n  Equipment                                   \n  Buildings and         5-39years             \n  improvements                                \n  Furniture and         3-10years             \n  equipment                                   \n  Computer software     3years                \n  Leasehold             Lesser of the useful  \n  improvements          life or the           \n                        remaining lease term  \n                                              \nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are\nexpensed as incurred and gains or losses upon\ndisposition are recognized in our consolidated\nstatements of income as realized. See \u201cNote\n7\u2014Premises, Equipment and Leases\u201d for\nadditional information.\nLeases\nLease classification is determined at\ninception for all lease transactions with an\ninitial term greater than one year. Operating\nleases are included as right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d)\nassets within other assets, and operating\nlease liabilities are classified as other\nliabilities on our consolidated balance\nsheets. Finance leases are included in\npremises and equipment, and other borrowings\non our consolidated balance sheets. Our\noperating lease expense is included in\noccupancy and equipment within non-interest\nexpense in our consolidated statements of\nincome. Lease expense for minimum lease\npayments are recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. See \u201cNote\n7\u2014Premises, Equipment and Leases\u201d for\nadditional information.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred, plus\nthe fair value of any non-controlling\ninterests in the acquiree, over the fair value\nof the net assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed as of the acquisition date and is\nassigned to one or more reporting units at\nacquisition. A reporting unit is defined as an\noperating segment, or a business unit that is\none level below an operating segment. We have\nfourreporting units: Credit Card, Auto\nFinance, Other Consumer Banking, and\nCommercial Banking. Goodwill is not amortized\nbut is tested for impairment at the reporting\nunit level annually or more frequently if\nadverse circumstances indicate that it is more\nlikely than not that the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value. These\nindicators could include a sustained,\nsignificant decline in the Company\u2019s stock\nprice, a decline in expected future cash\nflows, significant disposition activity, a\nsignificant adverse change in the economic or\nbusiness environment, and the testing for\nrecoverability of a significant asset group,\namong others.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are\namortized on either an accelerated or\nstraight-line basis over their estimated\nuseful lives and are evaluated for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying amount of the assets may\nnot be recoverable. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and\nOther Intangible Assets\u201d for additional\ninformation.\n                                              \n  142    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) are\ninitially recorded at fair value when mortgage\nloans are sold or securitized in the secondary\nmarket and the right to service these loans is\nretained for a fee. Commercial MSRs are\nsubsequently accounted for under the\namortization method. We evaluate for\nimpairment as of each reporting date and\nrecognize any impairment in other non-interest\nincome. See \u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets\u201d for additional information.\nForeclosed Property and Repossessed Assets\nForeclosed property and repossessed assets\nobtained through our lending activities\ntypically include commercial real estate or\npersonal property, such as automobiles, and\nare recorded at net realizable value. For\nforeclosed property and repossessed assets, we\ngenerally reclassify the loan to repossessed\nassets upon repossession of the property in\nsatisfaction of the loan. Net realizable value\nis the estimated fair value of the underlying\ncollateral less estimated selling costs and is\nbased on appraisals, when available.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, foreclosed\nproperty and repossessed assets are recorded\nat the lower of our initial cost basis or net\nrealizable value, which is routinely monitored\nand updated. Any changes in net realizable\nvalue and gains or losses realized from\ndisposition of the property are recorded in\nother non-interest expense. See \u201cNote 16\u2014Fair\nValue Measurement\u201d for details.\nRestricted Equity Investments\nWe have investments in Federal Home Loan Banks\n(\u201cFHLB\u201d) stock and in Federal Reserve Bank\nstock. These investments, which are included\nin other assets on our consolidated balance\nsheets, are not marketable, are carried at\ncost, and are reviewed for impairment if there\nis any indicator of impairment.\nLitigation\nWe establish reserves for litigation-related\nmatters that arise from the ordinary course of\nour business activities when it is probable\nthat a loss associated with a claim or\nproceeding has been incurred and the amount of\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated.\nProfessional service costs, including fees for\nattorneys and experts, expected to be incurred\nin connection with a loss contingency are\nexpensed as services are provided. See \u201cNote\n18\u2014Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and\nOthers\u201d for additional information.\nCustomer Rewards Reserve\n\nWe offer products, primarily credit cards,\nwhich include programs that allow members to\nearn rewards based on account activity that\ncan be redeemed for cash (primarily in the\nform of statement credits), gift cards,\ntravel, or covering eligible charges. The\namount of reward that a customer earns varies\nbased on the terms and conditions of the\nrewards program and product. When rewards are\nearned by a customer, rewards expense is\ngenerally recorded as an offset to interchange\nincome, with a corresponding increase to the\ncustomer rewards reserve. The customer rewards\nreserve is computed based on the estimated\nfuture cost of earned rewards that are\nexpected to be redeemed and is reduced as\nrewards are redeemed. In estimating the\ncustomer rewards reserve, we consider\nhistorical redemption and spending behavior,\nas well as the terms and conditions of the\ncurrent rewards programs, among other factors.\nOur customer rewards reserve assumes the vast\nmajority of all rewards earned will eventually\nbe redeemed.\n\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest Income and Fees\nInterest income and fees on loans and\ninvestment securities are recognized based on\nthe contractual provisions of the underlying\narrangements.\nLoan origination fees, direct loan origination\ncosts, premiums and discounts on loans held\nfor investment are deferred and generally\namortized into interest income as yield\nadjustments over the contractual life and/or\ncommitment period using the interest method.\nCosts deferred include, among other things,\nincentives paid to our network of auto dealers\nfor loan referrals. In certain circumstances,\nwe elect to factor prepayment estimates into\nthe calculation of the constant effective\nyield necessary to apply the interest method.\nPrepayment estimates are based on historical\nprepayment data, existing and forecasted\ninterest rates,\n                                              \n  143    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nand economic data. For credit card loans, loan\norigination fees and direct loan origination\ncosts are amortized on a straight-line basis\nover a 12-month period.\n\nThe unamortized premiums, discounts and other\nbasis adjustments on investment securities are\nincluded as components of the investment\nsecurities\u2019 carrying value and are generally\nrecognized in interest income as yield\nadjustments over the contractual lives of the\nsecurities using the interest method. However,\npremiums for certain callable investment\nsecurities are amortized to the earliest call\ndate.\n\nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans\nare recorded in revenue when earned and\npresented on our consolidated balance sheets\nwithin either loan receivables (if they have\nbeen billed to the customer) or interest\nreceivable (if they have not yet been billed\nto the customer). Annual membership fees are\nclassified as service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees in our consolidated\nstatements of income and are deferred and\namortized into income over 12months on a\nstraight-line basis.\nInterchange Income\nInterchange income generally represents fees\nfor standing ready to authorize and providing\nsettlement on credit and debit card\ntransactions processed through the MasterCard\u00ae\n(\u201cMasterCard\u201d) and Visa\u00ae (\u201cVisa\u201d) interchange\nnetworks. The levels and structure of\ninterchange rates set by MasterCard and Visa\ncan vary based on cardholder purchase volumes,\namong other factors. We recognize interchange\nincome upon settlement. See \u201cNote 17\u2014Business\nSegments and Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers\u201d for additional details.\nCard Partnership Agreements\nWe have contractual agreements with certain\nretailers and other partners to provide\nlending and other services to a mutual\ncustomer base. We primarily issue private-\nlabel and cobrand credit card loans to these\ncustomers over the terms of the partnership\nagreements.\n\nCertain partners assist in or perform\nmarketing activities on our behalf and promote\nour products and services to their customers.\nAs compensation for providing these services,\nwe often pay royalties, bounties or other\nspecial bonuses to these partners. Our\npayments to partners are generally recorded as\nreductions of revenue or as marketing\nexpenses, depending on their nature. Our\ncredit card partnership agreements may also\nprovide for profit or revenue sharing payments\nwhich are presented as a reduction of the\nrelated revenue line item(s) when owed to the\npartner.\n\nWhen a partner agrees to share a portion of\nthe credit losses associated with the\npartnership, we evaluate the contractual\nprovisions for the loss share payments as well\nas applicable accounting guidance to determine\nwhether to present the sharing of losses on a\ngross or net basis in our consolidated\nfinancial statements. When loss sharing\namounts due from partners are presented on a\nnet basis, they are recorded as a reduction to\nour provision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income and reduce\nthe charge-off amounts that we report. The\nallowance for credit losses attributable to\nthese portfolios is also reduced by the\nexpected reimbursements from these partners\nfor loss sharing amounts. See \u201cNote\n4\u2014Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\u201d for additional\ninformation related to our loss sharing\narrangements.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe are authorized to issue stock\u2013based\ncompensation to employees and directors in\nvarious forms, primarily as restricted stock\nunits (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and performance share units\n(\u201cPSUs\u201d). In addition, we also issue cash-\nsettled RSUs which are not counted against the\ncommon shares reserved for issuance or\navailable for issuance because they are\nsettled in cash.\nFor awards settled in shares, we generally\nrecognize compensation expense on a straight-\nline basis over the award\u2019s requisite service\nperiod based on the fair value of the award at\nthe grant date. If an award settled in shares\ncontains a performance condition with graded\nvesting, we recognize compensation expense\nusing the accelerated attribution method.\nRestricted stock units that are cash-settled\nare accounted for as liability awards which\nresults in quarterly expense fluctuations\nbased on changes in our stock price through\nthe date that the awards are settled. Awards\nto participants that are eligible for\nretirement or become eligible during the\nvesting period are expensed immediately or\nover the time period between the grant date\nand when the participant becomes retirement\neligible, respectively. Stock-based\ncompensation expense is included in salaries\nand associate benefits in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\n                                              \n  144    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFor RSUs and PSUs, the fair value of stock-\nbased compensation used in determining\ncompensation expense will generally equal the\nfair market value of our common stock on the\ndate of grant. Certain share-settled awards\nhave discretionary vesting conditions which\nresult in the remeasurement of these awards at\nfair value each reporting period and the\npotential for compensation expense to\nfluctuate with changes in our stock price. See\n\u201cNote 13\u2014Stock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d for\nadditional details.\nMarketing Expenses\nMarketing expense includes the cost of our\nvarious promotional efforts to attract and\nretain customers such as advertising,\npromotional materials, and certain customer\nincentives, including spend-based bonuses. We\nexpense marketing costs as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize the current and deferred tax\nconsequences of all transactions that have\nbeen recognized in the financial statements\nusing the provisions of the enacted tax laws.\nCurrent income tax expense represents our\nestimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the\ncurrent period and includes income tax expense\nrelated to our uncertain tax positions, as\nwell as tax-related interest and penalties.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax basis of assets\nand liabilities and are measured using the\nenacted tax rates and laws that will be in\neffect when the differences are expected to\nreverse. We record valuation allowances to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. We\nrecord the effect of remeasuring deferred tax\nassets and liabilities due to a change in tax\nrates or laws as a component of income tax\nexpense related to continuing operations for\nthe period in which the change is enacted. We\nrelease income tax effects stranded in AOCI\nwhen an entire portfolio of the type of item\nis sold, terminated or extinguished. Income\ntax benefits are recognized when, based on\ntheir technical merits, they are more likely\nthan not to be sustained upon examination. The\namount recognized is the largest amount of\nbenefit that is more likely than not to be\nrealized upon settlement. See \u201cNote 15\u2014Income\nTaxes\u201d for additional details.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated and reported\nunder the \u201ctwo-class\u201d method. The \u201ctwo-class\u201d\nmethod is an earnings allocation method under\nwhich earnings per share is calculated for\neach class of common stock and participating\nsecurity considering both dividends declared\nor accumulated and participation rights in\nundistributed earnings as if all such earnings\nhad been distributed during the period. We\nhave unvested share-based payment awards which\nhave a right to receive non-forfeitable\ndividends and are therefore deemed to be\nparticipating securities.\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by\ndividing net income, after deducting dividends\non preferred stock and participating\nsecurities as well as undistributed earnings\nallocated to participating securities, by the\naverage number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period, net of any treasury shares.\nWe calculate diluted earnings per share in a\nsimilar manner after consideration of the\npotential dilutive effect of common stock\nequivalents on the average number of common\nshares outstanding during the period. Common\nstock equivalents include stock options, RSUs\nand PSUs. Common stock equivalents are\ncalculated based upon the treasury stock\nmethod using an average market price of common\nshares during the period. Dilution is not\nconsidered when a net loss is reported. Common\nstock equivalents that have an antidilutive\neffect are excluded from the computation of\ndiluted earnings per share. See \u201cNote\n12\u2014Earnings Per Common Share\u201d for additional\ndetails.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAll derivative financial instruments, whether\ndesignated in a qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationship or not, are reported at their\nfair value on our consolidated balance sheets\nas either assets or liabilities. See \u201cNote\n9\u2014Derivative Instruments and Hedging\nActivities\u201d for additional details.\n                                              \n  145    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFair Value\nFair value, also referred to as an exit price,\nis defined as the price that would be received\nfor an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. See\n\u201cNote 16\u2014Fair Value Measurement\u201d for\nadditional information.\nAccounting for Acquisitions\nWe account for business combinations under the\nacquisition method of accounting. Under the\nacquisition method, tangible and intangible\nidentifiable assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed and any non-controlling interest in\nthe acquiree are recorded at fair value as of\nthe acquisition date, with limited exceptions.\nTransaction costs and costs to restructure the\nacquired company are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill is recognized as the excess of the\nacquisition price over the estimated fair\nvalue of the identifiable net assets acquired.\nLikewise, if the fair value of the net assets\nacquired is greater than the acquisition\nprice, a bargain purchase gain is recognized\nand recorded in other non-interest income.\nIf the acquired set of activities and assets\ndo not meet the accounting definition of a\nbusiness, the transaction is accounted for as\nan asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition,\nthe assets acquired are recorded at the\npurchase price plus any transaction costs\nincurred and no goodwill is recognized.\n                                              \n  146    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nAccounting Standards Adopted During the Twelve\nMonths Ended December 31, 2023\n                                              \n                                Adoption      \n                                Timing and    \n  Standard       Guidance       Financial     \n                                Statement     \n                                Impacts       \n                                We adopted    \n                                this          \n                                guidance in   \n                                the first     \n                 Eliminates     quarter of    \n                 accounting     2023 using a  \n                 guidance       modified      \n                 for            retrospecti\u2026  \n                 troubled       adoption      \n                 debt           method,       \n                 restructur\u2026    which         \n                 (\u201cTDRs\u201d) by    results in a  \n                 creditors,     cumulative-\u2026  \n  Modified       and            adjustment    \n  Borrowings     enhances       to retained   \n  Experienci\u2026    disclosure     earnings in   \n  Financial      requiremen\u2026    the period    \n  Difficulty     for certain    of adoption   \n  and Vintage    loan           and           \n  Disclosures    refinancin\u2026    prospective   \n  ASU No.        and            application   \n  2022-02,       restructur\u2026    of the        \n  Financial      by             enhanced      \n  Instruments    creditors      disclosure    \n  - Credit       when a         requirement\u2026  \n  Losses         borrower is    Our adoption  \n  (Topic         experienci\u2026    of this       \n  326):Troub\u2026    financial      standard did  \n  Debt           difficulty.    not have a    \n  Restructur\u2026    Requires an    material      \n  and Vintage    entity to      impact on     \n  Disclosures    disclose       our           \n  Issued         current-pe\u2026    consolidated  \n  March 2022     gross          financial     \n                 write-offs     statements.   \n                 by year of     See \u201cNote     \n                 origination    3\u2014Loans\u201d and  \n                 for            \u201cNote         \n                 financing      4\u2014Allowance   \n                 receivables    for Credit    \n                 and net        Losses and    \n                 investments    Reserve for   \n                 in leases.

and manage\nour exposure to credit risk. We discuss these\nrisks and our credit quality indicator for\neach portfolio segment below.\n\nCredit Card\n\nOur credit card loan portfolio is highly\ndiversified across millions of accounts and\nnumerous geographies without significant\nindividual exposure. We therefore generally\nmanage credit risk based on portfolios with\ncommon risk characteristics. The risk in our\ncredit card loan portfolio correlates to broad\neconomic trends, such as the U.S. unemployment\nrate and U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product\n(\u201cGDP\u201d) growth rate, as well as consumers\u2019\nfinancial condition, all of which can have a\nmaterial effect on credit performance. The key\nindicator we assess in monitoring the credit\nquality and risk of our credit card loan\nportfolio is delinquency trends, including an\nanalysis of loan migration between delinquency\ncategories over time.\nThe table below presents our credit card\nportfolio by delinquency status as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 3.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n      $      $      $      $      $      $    \n                                              \n                                              \n  153    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nConsumer Banking\nOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists\nof auto and retail banking loans.

We assign internal risk ratings\nto loans based on relevant information about\nthe ability of the borrowers to repay their\ndebt. In determining the risk rating of a\nparticular loan, some of the factors\nconsidered are the borrower\u2019s current\nfinancial condition, historical and projected\nfuture credit performance, prospects for\nsupport from financially responsible\nguarantors, the estimated realizable value of\nany collateral and current economic trends.\nThe scale based on our internal risk rating\nsystem is as follows:\n\n\u2022 Noncriticized: Loans that have not been\ndesignated as criticized, frequently referred\nto as \u201cpass\u201d loans.\n\n\u2022 Criticized performing: Loans in which the\nfinancial condition of the obligor is\nstressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or\ncollateral values. The borrower currently has\nadequate capacity to meet near-term\nobligations; however, the stress, left\nunabated, may result in deterioration of the\nrepayment prospects at some future date.\n\n\u2022 Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not\nadequately protected by the current net worth\nand paying capacity of the obligor or the\ncollateral pledged, if any. Loans classified\nas criticized nonperforming have a well-\ndefined weakness, or weaknesses, which\njeopardize the full repayment of the debt.\nThese loans are characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain a credit loss\nif the deficiencies are not corrected and are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status.\n\nWe use our internal risk rating system for\nregulatory reporting, determining the\nfrequency of credit exposure reviews, and\nevaluating and determining the allowance for\ncredit losses. Generally, loans that are\ndesignated as criticized performing and\ncriticized nonperforming are reviewed\nquarterly by management to determine if they\nare appropriately classified/rated and whether\nany impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are\nalso generally reviewed, at least annually, to\ndetermine the appropriate risk rating. In\naddition, we evaluate the risk rating during\nthe renewal process of any loan or if a loan\nbecomes past due.\n\nThe following table presents our commercial\nbanking portfolio of loans held for investment\nby internal risk ratings as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022. The internal risk rating status\nincludes all past due loans, both performing\nand nonperforming.\nTable 3.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by\nInternal Risk Ratings\n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n  156    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Criticized exposures correspond to the\n\u201cSpecial Mention,\u201d \u201cSubstandard\u201d and\n\u201cDoubtful\u201d asset categories defined by bank\nregulatory authorities.\n                                              \n  157    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFinancial Difficulty Modifications to\nBorrowers\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may\nprovide short-term (one to twelve months) or\nlong-term (greater than twelve months)\nmodifications to a borrower experiencing\nfinancial difficulty to improve long-term\ncollectability of the loan and to avoid the\nneed for repossession or foreclosure of\ncollateral.\n\nWe consider the impact of all loan\nmodifications when estimating the credit\nquality of our loan portfolio and establishing\nallowance levels. For our Commercial Banking\ncustomers, loan modifications are also\nconsidered in the assignment of an internal\nrisk rating.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage\nDisclosures using the modified retrospective\nadoption method. The ASU eliminates the\naccounting guidance for TDRs and enhances\ndisclosure requirements for certain loan\nrefinancings and restructurings by creditors\nwhen a borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The types of modifications we\noffer borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty did not change as a result of ASU\n2022-02. Under this new accounting guidance,\nFDMs are accumulated and the performance of\neach loan that received a FDM is reported on a\nrolling twelve month basis.

A default\noccurs if a FDM is either 90 days or more\ndelinquent, has been charged off, or has been\nreclassified from accrual to nonaccrual\nstatus. Loans that entered a modification\nprogram in any stage of delinquency are\nincluded in the aging table above. Loans that\nentered a modification program while in\ndefault are not considered to have\nsubsequently defaulted for purposes of this\ndisclosure. The allowance for any FDMs that\nhave subsequently defaulted is measured using\nthe same methodology as the allowance for\nloans held for investment.

Expected recoveries of\namounts previously charged off or expected to\nbe charged off are recognized within the\nallowance. Significant judgment is applied in\nour estimation of lifetime credit losses. When\ndeveloping an estimate of expected credit\nlosses, we use both quantitative and\nqualitative methods in considering all\navailable information relevant to assessing\ncollectability. This may include internal\ninformation, external information or a\ncombination of both relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Our estimate of\nexpected credit losses includes a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period of one year\nand then reverts over a one-year period to\nhistorical losses at each relevant loss\ncomponent of the estimate. Management will\nconsider and may qualitatively adjust for\nconditions, changes and trends in loan\nportfolios that may not be captured in modeled\nresults. These adjustments are referred to as\nqualitative factors and represent management\u2019s\njudgment of the imprecision and risks inherent\nin the processes and assumptions used in\nestablishing the allowance for credit losses.\nFor credit card loans, finance charges and\nfees are charged off simultaneously with the\ncharge-off of other components of amortized\ncost as a reduction of revenue. Total net\nrevenue was reduced by $ 1.9billion, $\n946million and $ 629million in 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively, for finance charges and\nfees charged-off as uncollectible.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our\nCommercial Banking business that are not\nunconditionally cancellable by us and for\nwhich we estimate expected credit losses in\nestablishing a reserve. This reserve is\nmeasured using the same measurement objectives\nas the allowance for loans held for\ninvestment. We build or release the reserve\nfor unfunded lending commitments through the\nprovision for credit losses in our\nconsolidated statements of income, and the\nrelated reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments is included in other liabilities\non our consolidated balance sheets.\nSee \u201cNote 1\u2014Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d for further discussion of the\nmethodology and policies for determining our\nallowance for credit losses for each of our\nloan portfolio segments, as well as\ninformation on our reserve for unfunded\nlending commitments.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for\nUnfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the\nallowance for credit losses and reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments by portfolio\nsegment for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021.

The initial allowance of PCD\nloans was $ 32million, $ 10million and $\n6million for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n(3) Impact from the adoption of ASU No.\n2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures as of January 1, 2023.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU No.\n2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures using the modified\nretrospective approach, which consists of\nimplementing disclosure requirements\nprospectively as of the adoption date. The ASU\nrequires public entities to disclose current-\nperiod gross charge-offs by year of\norigination for financing receivables, with an\nexception for credit cards as they are\nrevolving in nature.\n\nWe charge off loans when we determine that the\nloan is uncollectible. The amortized cost\nbasis, excluding accrued interest, is charged\noff as a reduction to the allowance for credit\nlosses in accordance with our accounting\npolicies.

Our primary\ninvolvement with VIEs is related to our\nsecuritization transactions in which we\ntransfer assets to securitization trusts. We\nprimarily securitize credit card and auto\nloans, which provide a source of funding for\nus and enable us to transfer a certain portion\nof the economic risk of the loans or related\ndebt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is referred to as the\nprimary beneficiary and is required to\nconsolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs\nin which we are involved have been\nconsolidated in our financial statements.\nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated\nVIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily\nconsist of cash, loan receivables and the\nrelated allowance for credit losses, which we\nreport on our consolidated balance sheets\nunder restricted cash for securitization\ninvestors, loans held in consolidated trusts\nand allowance for credit losses, respectively.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary\nsource of funds to settle its obligations.\nCreditors of these VIEs typically do not have\nrecourse to our general credit. Liabilities\nprimarily consist of debt securities issued by\nthe VIEs, which we report under securitized\ndebt obligations on our consolidated balance\nsheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities\nreflected on our consolidated balance sheets\nand our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum\nexposure to loss is estimated based on the\nunlikely event that all of the assets in the\nVIEs become worthless and we are required to\nmeet the maximum amount of any remaining\nfunding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in\nwhich we had continuing involvement or held a\nsignificant variable interest, aggregated\nbased on VIEs with similar characteristics as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022. We separately\npresent information for consolidated and\nunconsolidated VIEs.\nTable 5.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and\nUnconsolidated VIEs\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       23       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       10       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       33       \u2026       2\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  168    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026                \u2026                   \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026       A\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       of       \u2026       of       \u2026  \n         \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026       L\u2026       \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  0    $   0    $  0  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       0        0       0  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       0        0       0  \n                                              \n         \u2026       19       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       10       0        0       0  \n         0        0       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       29       \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026    $  1\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Excludes insignificant VIEs from\npreviously exited businesses.\n\n(2) Represents the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities of the VIE, which includes the\nseller\u2019s interest and repurchased notes held\nby other related parties.\n\n(3) In certain investment structures, we\nconsolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its\nprimary asset an investment in an\nunconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we\ndisclose the carrying amount of assets and\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheets\nas unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating\nour exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are\ngenerally the operating entities generating\nthe exposure. The carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities included in the unconsolidated\nVIE columns above related to these investment\nstructures were $ 2.6billion of assets and $\n989million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2023 and $ 2.3billion of assets and $\n616million of liabilities as of December 31,\n2022.\n\n(4) Primarily consists of variable interests\nin companies that promote renewable energy\nsources and other equity method investments.\n\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are\ntransferred to a trust, which generally meets\nthe definition of a VIE. We engage in\nsecuritization activities as an issuer and an\ninvestor. Our primary securitization issuance\nactivity includes credit card and auto\nsecuritizations, conducted through\nsecuritization trusts which we consolidate.\nOur continuing involvement in these\nsecuritization transactions mainly consists of\nacting as the primary servicer and holding\ncertain retained interests.\n\nIn our multifamily agency business, we\noriginate multifamily commercial real estate\nloans and transfer them to government-\nsponsored enterprises (\u201cGSEs\u201d) who may, in\nturn, securitize them. We retain the related\nMSR and service the transferred loans pursuant\nto the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an\ninvestor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and\nABS in our investment securities portfolio,\nwhich represent variable interests in the\nrespective securitization trusts from which\nthose securities were issued. We do not\nconsolidate the securitization trusts employed\nin these transactions as we do not have the\npower to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance\nof these securitization trusts. We exclude\nthese VIEs from the tables within this note\nbecause we do not consider our continuing\ninvolvement with these VIEs to be significant\nas we either solely invest in securities\nissued by the VIE and were not involved in the\ndesign of the VIE or no transfers have\noccurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our\nmaximum exposure to loss as a result of our\ninvolvement with these VIEs is the carrying\nvalue of the MSRs and investment securities on\nour consolidated balance sheets as well as our\ncontractual obligations under loss sharing\narrangements. See \u201cNote 18\u2014Commitments,\nContingencies, Guarantees and Others\u201d for\ninformation about the loss sharing agreements,\n\u201cNote 6\u2014Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d\nfor information related to our MSRs associated\nwith these securitizations and \u201cNote\n2\u2014Investment Securities\u201d for more information\non the securities held in our investment\nsecurities portfolio. In addition, where we\nhave certain lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business with entities that\ncould be VIEs, we have also excluded these\nVIEs from the tables presented in this note.\nSee \u201cNote 3\u2014Loans\u201d for additional information\nregarding our lending arrangements in the\nnormal course of business.\n                                              \n  169    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe table below presents our continuing\ninvolvement in certain securitization-related\nVIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 5.2: Continuing Involvement in\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\n                                              \n  (Doll\u2026                                      \n  in                                          \n  milli\u2026                                      \n  Decem\u2026                                      \n  31,           Credit                        \n  2023:           Card             Auto       \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  held                                        \n  by        $   14,029         $  4,014       \n  third\u2026                                      \n  inves\u2026                                      \n  Recei\u2026                                      \n  in the        26,404            4,839       \n  trusts                                      \n  Cash                                        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  spread             0               19       \n  or                                          \n  reser\u2026                                      \n  accou\u2026                                      \n  Retai\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Servi\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  retai\u2026                                      \n  Decem\u2026                                      \n  31,                                         \n  2022:                                       \n  Secur\u2026                                      \n  held                                        \n  by        $   12,976         $  3,997       \n  third\u2026                                      \n  inves\u2026                                      \n  Recei\u2026                                      \n  in the        24,367            4,682       \n  trusts                                      \n  Cash                                        \n  balan\u2026                                      \n  of                                          \n  spread             0               23       \n  or                                          \n  reser\u2026                                      \n  accou\u2026                                      \n  Retai\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  inter\u2026                                      \n  Servi\u2026                Yes              Yes  \n  retai\u2026                                      \n                                              \nCredit Card Securitizations\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card\nloans which provides a source of funding for\nus. Credit card securitizations involve the\ntransfer of credit card receivables to\nsecuritization trusts. These trusts then issue\ndebt securities collateralized by the\ntransferred receivables to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nin our credit card securitizations and\ncontinue to service the receivables in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we\nsecuritize a portion of our auto loans which\nprovides a source of funding for us. Auto\nsecuritizations involve the transfer of auto\nloans to securitization trusts. These trusts\nthen issue debt securities collateralized by\nthe transferred loans to third-party\ninvestors. We hold certain retained interests\nand continue to service the loans in these\ntrusts. We consolidate these trusts because we\nare deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we\nhave the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the trusts, and the right to\nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb\nlosses that could potentially be significant\nto the trusts.\n\nOther VIEs\n\nAffordable Housing Entities\n\nAs part of our community reinvestment\ninitiatives, we invest in private investment\nfunds that make equity investments in\nmultifamily affordable housing properties. We\nreceive affordable housing tax credits for\nthese investments. The activities of these\nentities are financed with a combination of\ninvested equity capital and debt. We account\nfor our investments in qualified affordable\nhousing projects using the proportional\namortization method, where costs of the\ninvestment are amortized over the period in\nwhich the investor expects to receive tax\ncredits and other tax benefits, and the\nresulting amortization is recognized as a\ncomponent of income tax expense attributable\nto continuing operations. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized\namortization of $ 682million and $ 637million,\nrespectively, and tax credits of $ 721million\nand $ 664million, respectively, associated\nwith these investments within income tax\nprovision. The carrying value of our equity\ninvestments in these qualified affordable\nhousing projects was $ 5.5billion and $\n4.9billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.

We consolidate the VIEs in\nwhich we have the power to direct the\nactivities that most significantly impact the\nVIE\u2019s economic performance and where we have\nthe obligation to absorb losses or right to\nreceive benefits that could be potentially\nsignificant to the VIE. We consolidate other\ninvestments and CDEs that are not considered\nto be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling\nfinancial interest.

An impairment of a\nreporting unit\u2019s goodwill is determined based\non the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s\ncarrying value exceeds its fair value, limited\nto the amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit.\n\nThe fair value of reporting units is\ncalculated using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology, a form of the income approach.\nThe calculation uses projected cash flows\nbased on each reporting unit\u2019s internal\nforecast and uses the perpetuity growth method\nto calculate terminal values. These cash flows\nand terminal values are then discounted using\nappropriate discount rates, which are largely\nbased on our external cost of equity with\nadjustments for risk inherent in each\nreporting unit. The carrying amount for a\nreporting unit is the sum of its respective\ncapital requirements, goodwill and other\nintangibles balances. Capital is allocated\nbased on each reporting unit\u2019s specific\nregulatory capital requirements, economic\ncapital requirements, and underlying risks.\nConsolidated stockholder\u2019s equity in excess of\nthe sum of all reporting unit\u2019s capital\nrequirements that is not identified for future\ncapital needs, such as dividends, share\nbuybacks, or other strategic initiatives, is\nallocated to the reporting units and the Other\ncategory and assumed distributed to equity\nholders in future periods. Our discounted cash\nflow analysis requires management to make\njudgments about future loan and deposit\ngrowth, revenue growth, credit losses, and\ncapital rates. The reasonableness of our fair\nvalue calculation is assessed by reference to\na market-based approach using comparable\nmarket multiples and recent market\ntransactions where available.\n                                              \n  173    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nIntangible Assets\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we\nrecorded intangible assets that include PCCR,\nsponsorship, customer and merchant\nrelationships, partnership, trade names, and\nother customer contract intangibles.

The majority of our\nleases are operating leases of office space,\nretail bank branches and caf\u00e9s. Our operating\nleases expire at various dates through 2071,\nalthough some have extension or termination\noptions, and we assess the likelihood of\nexercising such options. If it is reasonably\ncertain that we will exercise the options,\nthen we include the impact in the measurement\nof our right-of-use assets and lease\nliabilities.\nOur right-of-use assets and lease liabilities\nfor operating leases are included in other\nassetsand other liabilitieson our consolidated\nbalance sheets. As most of our operating\nleases do not provide an implicit rate, we use\nour incremental borrowing rate in determining\nthe present value of future lease payments.\nOur operating lease expense is included in\noccupancy and equipment within non-interest\nexpense in our consolidated statements of\nincome. Total operating lease expense consists\nof operating lease cost, which is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term,\nand variable lease cost, which is recognized\nbased on actual amounts incurred. We also\nsublease certain premises, and sublease income\nis included in other non-interest income in\nour consolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables present information about\nour operating lease portfolio and the related\nlease costs as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 7.2 Operating Lease Portfolio\n                                              \n

Our primary market\nrisks stem from the impact on our earnings and\neconomic value of equity due to changes in\ninterest rates and, to a lesser extent,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. We manage\nour interest rate sensitivity by employing\nseveral techniques, which include changing the\nduration and re-pricing characteristics of\nvarious assets and liabilities by using\ninterest rate derivatives. We also use foreign\ncurrency derivatives to limit our earnings and\ncapital exposures to foreign exchange risk by\nhedging exposures denominated in foreign\ncurrencies. We primarily use interest rate and\nforeign currency swaps to perform these\nhedging activities, but we may also use a\nvariety of other derivative instruments,\nincluding caps, floors, options, futures and\nforward contracts, to manage our interest rate\nand foreign exchange risks. We designate these\nrisk management derivatives as either\nqualifying accounting hedges or free-standing\nderivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are\nfurther designated as fair value hedges, cash\nflow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-\nstanding derivatives are economic hedges that\ndo not qualify for hedge accounting.\nWe also offer interest rate, commodity,\nforeign currency derivatives and other\ncontracts as an accommodation to our customers\nwithin our Commercial Banking business. We\nenter into these derivatives with our\ncustomers primarily to help them manage their\ninterest rate risks, hedge their energy and\nother commodities exposures, and manage\nforeign currency fluctuations. We offset the\nsubstantial majority of the market risk\nexposure of our customer accommodation\nderivatives through derivative transactions\nwith other counterparties.\nSee below for additional information on our\nuse of derivatives and how we account for\nthem:\n\u2022 Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas fair value hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to changes in the fair\nvalue of certain financial assets and\nliabilities, which fluctuate in value as a\nresult of movements in interest rates. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as\nfair value hedges are presented in the same\nline item in our consolidated statements of\nincome as the earnings effect of the hedged\nitems. We enter into receive-fixed, pay-float\ninterest rate swaps to hedge changes in the\nfair value of outstanding fixed rate debt and\ndeposits due to fluctuations in market\ninterest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed,\nreceive-float interest rate swaps to hedge\nchanges in the fair value of fixed rate\ninvestment securities.\n\u2022 Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives\nas cash flow hedges when they are used to\nmanage our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to forecasted transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives\ndesignated as cash flow hedges are recorded as\na component of AOCI. Those amounts are\nreclassified into earnings in the same period\nduring which the hedged forecasted\ntransactions impact earnings and presented in\nthe same line item in our consolidated\nstatements of income as the earnings effect of\nthe hedged items. We enter into receive-fixed,\npay-float interest rate swaps and interest\nrate floors to modify the interest rate\ncharacteristics of designated credit card and\ncommercial loans from floating to fixed in\norder to reduce the impact of changes in\nforecasted future cash flows due to\nfluctuations in market interest rates. We also\nenter into foreign currency forward contracts\nto hedge our exposure to variability in cash\nflows related to intercompany borrowings\ndenominated in foreign currencies.\n\u2022 Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment\nhedges to manage the foreign currency exposure\nrelated to our net investments in foreign\noperations that have functional currencies\nother than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the\nfair value of net investment hedges are\nrecorded in the translation adjustment\ncomponent of AOCI, offsetting the translation\ngain or loss from those foreign operations. We\nexecute net investment hedges using foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge the\ntranslation exposure of the net investment in\nour foreign operations under the forward\nmethod.\n\u2022 Free-Standing Derivatives: Our free-standing\nderivatives primarily consist of our customer\naccommodation derivatives and other economic\nhedges. The customer accommodation derivatives\nand the related offsetting contracts are\nmainly interest rate, commodity and foreign\ncurrency contracts. The other free-standing\nderivatives are primarily used to economically\nhedge the risk of changes in the fair value of\nour commercial mortgage loan origination and\npurchase commitments as well as other\ninterests held. Changes in the fair value of\nfree-standing derivatives are recorded in\nearnings as a component of other non-interest\nincome.\n                                              \n  179    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of\ncredit risk that stems from the potential\nfailure of a counterparty to perform according\nto the terms of the contract, including making\npayments due upon maturity of certain\nderivative instruments. We execute our\nderivative contracts primarily in OTC markets.\nWe also execute interest rate and commodity\nfutures in the exchange-traded derivative\nmarkets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both\ntrades cleared through central counterparty\nclearinghouses (\u201cCCPs\u201d) and uncleared\nbilateral contracts. The Chicago Mercantile\nExchange (\u201cCME\u201d), the Intercontinental\nExchange (\u201cICE\u201d) and the LCH Group (\u201cLCH\u201d) are\nour CCPs for our centrally cleared contracts.\nIn our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter\ninto agreements directly with our derivative\ncounterparties.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk\nassociated with derivative instruments by\nentering into legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements, where applicable, and\nexchanging collateral with our counterparties,\ntypically in the form of cash or high-quality\nliquid securities. We exchange collateral in\ntwo primary forms: variation margin, which\nmitigates the risk of changes in value due to\ndaily market movements and is exchanged daily,\nand initial margin, which mitigates the risk\nof potential future exposure of a derivative\nand is exchanged at the outset of a\ntransaction and adjusted daily. We exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin on our\ncleared derivatives. For uncleared bilateral\nderivatives executed after September 1, 2021\nand in scope for initial margin, we exchange\nvariation margin and initial margin.\n\nThe amount of collateral exchanged for\nvariation margin is dependent upon the fair\nvalue of the derivative instruments as well as\nthe fair value of the pledged collateral and\nwill vary over time as market variables\nchange. The amount of the initial margin\nexchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation\nof initial margin exposure, as prescribed by\n1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators\u2019 margin\nrules for uncleared derivatives (\u201cPR Rules\u201d)\nor 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and\n2) the fair value of the pledged collateral;\nit will vary over time as market variables\nchange. When valuing collateral, an estimate\nof the variation in price and liquidity over\ntime is subtracted in the form of a \u201chaircut\u201d\nto discount the value of the collateral\npledged. Our exposure to derivative\ncounterparty credit risk, at any point in\ntime, is equal to the amount reported as a\nderivative asset on our balance sheet. The\nfair value of our derivatives is adjusted on\nan aggregate basis to take into consideration\nthe effects of legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and any associated\ncollateral received or pledged. See Table 9.3\nfor our net exposure associated with\nderivatives.\n\nThe terms under which we collateralize our\nexposures differ between cleared exposures and\nuncleared bilateral exposures.\n\n\u2022 CCPs : We clear eligible OTC derivatives\nwith CCPs as part of our regulatory\nrequirements. We also clear exchange-traded\ninstruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures\ncommission merchants (\u201cFCMs\u201d) serve as the\nintermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require\nthat we post initial and variation margin\nthrough our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-\npayment or default. Initial margin is required\nby CCPs as collateral against potential losses\non our exchange-traded and cleared derivative\ncontracts and variation margin is exchanged on\na daily basis to account for mark-to-market\nchanges in those derivative contracts. For\nCME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives,\nvariation margin cash payments are required to\nbe characterized as settlements. Our FCM\nagreements governing these derivative\ntransactions include provisions that may\nrequire us to post additional collateral under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral Counterparties : We enter into\nmaster netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with bilateral derivative\ncounterparties, where applicable, to mitigate\nthe risk of default. These bilateral\nagreements typically provide the right to\noffset exposure with the same counterparty and\nrequire the party in a net liability position\nto post collateral. Agreements with certain\nbilateral counterparties require both parties\nto maintain collateral in the event the fair\nvalues of uncleared derivatives exceed\nestablished exposure thresholds. Certain of\nthese bilateral agreements include provisions\nrequiring that our debt maintain a credit\nrating of investment grade or above by each of\nthe major credit rating agencies. In the event\nof a downgrade of our debt credit rating below\ninvestment grade, some of our counterparties\nwould have the right to terminate their\nderivative contract and close out existing\npositions.\n                                              \n  180    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation\nadjustments (\u201cCVAs\u201d) on our derivative assets\nto reflect the credit quality of our\ncounterparties. We consider collateral and\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements\nthat mitigate our credit exposure to each\ncounterparty in determining CVAs, which may be\nadjusted due to changes in the fair values of\nthe derivative contracts, collateral, and\ncreditworthiness of the counterparty.

adjustments on\ndiscontinued hedges.\n\n(2) Changes in fair values of cross-currency\nswaps attributable to changes in cross-\ncurrency basis spreads are excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded\nin other comprehensive income (\u201cOCI\u201d). The\ninitial value of the excluded component is\nrecognized in earnings over the life of the\nswap under the amortization approach.\n\n(3) See \u201cNote 10\u2014Stockholders\u2019 Equity\u201d for the\neffects of cash flow and net investment hedges\non AOCI and amounts reclassified to net\nincome, net of tax.\n\n(4) We recognized a loss of $ 66million and $\n17million for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, and gain of $ 163million for year\nended December 31, 2021, on foreign exchange\ncontracts reclassified from AOCI. These\namounts were largely offset by the foreign\ncurrency transaction gains (losses) on our\nforeign currency denominated intercompany\nfunding included in other non-interest income\non our consolidated statements of income .\n\nIn the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify\ninto earnings an after-tax loss of $\n712million recorded in AOCI as of December 31,\n2023 associated with cash flow hedges of\nforecasted transactions. This amount will\nlargely offset the cash flows associated with\nthe forecasted transactions hedged by these\nderivatives. The maximum length of time over\nwhich forecasted transactions were hedged was\napproximately 9.2years as of December 31,\n2023. The amount we expect to reclassify into\nearnings may change as a result of changes in\nmarket conditions and ongoing actions taken as\npart of our overall risk management strategy.\n                                              \n  186    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nFree-Standing Derivatives\nThe net impacts to our consolidated statements\nof income related to free-standing derivatives\nare presented below for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

Adequacy\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to the\nregulatory capital requirements established by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (\u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d),\nrespectively (the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d).\nThe Basel III Capital Rules implement certain\ncapital requirements published by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (\u201cBasel\nCommittee\u201d), along with certain provisions of\nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and\nother capital provisions.\nAs a bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) with total\nconsolidated assets of at least $250 billion\nbut less than $700 billion and not exceeding\nany of the applicable risk-based thresholds,\nthe Company is a Category III institution\nunder the Basel III Capital Rules.\nThe Bank, as a subsidiary of a Category III\ninstitution, is a Category III bank. Moreover,\nthe Bank, as an insured depository\ninstitution, is subject to prompt corrective\naction (\u201cPCA\u201d) capital regulations.\nUnder the Basel III Capital Rules, we must\nmaintain a minimum common equity Tier 1\n(\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1\ncapital ratio of 6.0% and a total capital\nratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to\nrisk-weighted assets. In addition, we must\nmaintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and\na minimum supplementary leverage ratio of\n3.0%. We are also subject to the capital\nconservation buffer requirement and\ncountercyclical capital buffer requirement,\neach as described below. Our capital and\nleverage ratios are calculated based on the\nBasel III standardized approach framework.\nWe have elected to exclude certain elements of\naccumulated other comprehensive income\n(\u201cAOCI\u201d) from our regulatory capital as\npermitted for a Category III institution. For\ninformation on the recognition of AOCI in\nregulatory capital under the proposed changes\nto the Basel III Capital Rules, see \u201cPart\nI\u2014Item 1. Business\u2014Supervision and\nRegulation\u2014Basel III Finalization Proposal.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d)\n(collectively, \u201cFederal Banking Agencies\u201d)\nadopted a final rule (\u201cCECL Transition Rule\u201d)\nthat provides banking institutions an optional\nfive-year transition period to phase in the\nimpact of the CECL standard on their\nregulatory capital (the \u201cCECL Transition\nElection\u201d). We adopted the CECL standard (for\naccounting purposes) as of January 1, 2020,\nand made the CECL Transition Election (for\nregulatory capital purposes) in the first\nquarter of 2020. Therefore, the applicable\namounts presented in this Report reflect such\nelection.\nPursuant to the CECL Transition Rule, a\nbanking institution could elect to delay the\nestimated impact of adopting CECL on its\nregulatory capital through December 31, 2021\nand then phase in the estimated cumulative\nimpact from January 1, 2022 through December\n31, 2024. For the \u201cday 2\u201d ongoing impact of\nCECL during the initial two years, the Federal\nBanking Agencies used a uniform \u201cscaling\nfactor\u201d of 25% as an approximation of the\nincrease in the allowance under the CECL\nstandard compared to the prior incurred loss\nmethodology. Accordingly, from January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2021, electing banking\ninstitutions were permitted to add back to\ntheir regulatory capital an amount equal to\nthe sum of the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL adoption\nimpact and 25% of the increase in the\nallowance since the adoption of the CECL\nstandard. From January 1, 2022 through\nDecember 31, 2024, the after-tax \u201cday 1\u201d CECL\nadoption impact and the cumulative \u201cday 2\u201d\nongoing impact are being phased in to\nregulatory capital at 25% per year.

As of December 31,\n2023, under the Amended and Restated 2004\nStock Incentive plan (\u201c2004 Plan\u201d), we are\nauthorized to issue 81million common shares in\nvarious forms, primarily share-settled RSUs,\nPSUs and non-qualified stock options. Of this\namount, approximately 23million shares remain\navailable for future issuance as of December\n31, 2023. The 2004 Plan permits the use of\nnewly issued shares or treasury shares upon\nthe settlement of options and stock-based\nincentive awards, and we generally settle by\nissuing new shares.\nWe also issue cash-settled restricted stock\nunits. These cash-settled units are not\ncounted against the common shares authorized\nfor issuance or available for issuance under\nthe 2004 Plan. Cash-settled units vesting\nduring 2023, 2022 and 2021 resulted in cash\npayments to associates of $ 4million, $\n8million and $ 7million, respectively. There\nwas no unrecognized compensation cost for\nunvested cash-settled units as of December 31,\n2023.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\nrecognized during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n513million, $ 314million and $ 331million,\nrespectively. The total income tax benefit for\nstock-based compensation recognized during\n2023, 2022 and 2021 was $ 99million, $\n75million and $ 62million, respectively.\nIn addition, we maintain an Associate Stock\nPurchase Plan (\u201cPurchase Plan\u201d), which is a\ncompensatory plan under the accounting\nguidance for stock-based compensation. Related\nto the Purchase Plan, we recognized\ncompensation expense of $ 39million, $\n36million and $ 33million for 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. We also maintain a\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan,\nwhich allows participating stockholders to\npurchase additional shares of our common stock\nthrough automatic reinvestment of dividends or\noptional cash investments.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Share\nUnits\nRSUs represent share-settled awards that do\nnot contain performance conditions and are\ngranted to certain employees at no cost to the\nrecipient. RSUs generally vest over three\nyearsfrom the date of grant; however, some\nRSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the first\nor third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs\nare subject to forfeiture until certain\nrestrictions have lapsed, including continued\nemployment for a specified period of time.\nPSUs represent share-settled awards that\ncontain performance conditions and are granted\nto certain employees at no cost to the\nrecipient. PSUs generally vest over three\nyearsfrom the date of grant; however, some\nPSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the third\nanniversary of the grant date. The number of\nPSUs that vest over three yearscan be reduced\nby 50% or 100% depending on whether specific\nperformance goals are met during the vesting\nperiod. The number of three-yearcliff vesting\nPSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent\nupon meeting specific performance goals over a\nthree-yearperiod. These PSUs also include an\nopportunity to receive from 0% to 150% of the\ntarget number of common shares.\nA recipient of an RSU or PSU is entitled to\nreceive a share of common stock after the\napplicable restrictions lapse and is generally\nentitled to receive cash payments or\nadditional shares of common stock equivalent\nto any dividends paid on the underlying common\nstock during the period the RSU or PSU is\noutstanding, but is not entitled to voting\nrights. Generally, the value of RSUs and PSUs\nwill equal the fair value of our common stock\non the date of grant and the expense is\nrecognized over the vesting period. Certain\nPSUs have discretionary vesting conditions and\nare remeasured at fair value each reporting\nperiod.\n                                              \n  194    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nThe following table presents a summary of 2023\nactivity for RSUs and PSUs.\nTable 13.1: Summary of Restricted Stock Units\nand Performance Share Units\n                                              \n                    Wei\u2026               Weig\u2026  \n                    Gra\u2026               Grant  \n                    Date                Date  \n         Res\u2026       Fair    Per\u2026        Fair  \n  (S\u2026    Sto\u2026       Val\u2026    Sha\u2026       Value  \n  in     Uni\u2026        per    Uni\u2026         per  \n  th\u2026    Uni\u2026       Unit    Uni\u2026        Unit  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Un\u2026                                         \n  as                                          \n  of     5,0\u2026    $  124\u2026    1,7\u2026    $  125.\u2026  \n  Ja\u2026                                         \n  1,                                          \n  20\u2026                                         \n  Gr\u2026    3,7\u2026       113\u2026    1,0\u2026       115.\u2026  \n  Ve\u2026    -2,\u2026       124\u2026    -811       111.\u2026  \n  Fo\u2026    -247       124\u2026     -18       123.\u2026  \n  Un\u2026                                         \n  as                                          \n  of     6,4\u2026    $  118\u2026    1,9\u2026    $  125.\u2026  \n  De\u2026                                         \n  31,                                         \n  20\u2026                                         \n                                              \n_________\n(1) Granted and vested include adjustments for\nachievement of specific performance goals for\nPSUs granted in prior periods.\n(2) The weighted-average grant date fair value\nof RSUs was $ 141.71and $ 127.37in 2022 and\n2021, respectively.

Investment\nstrategies and asset allocations are based on\ncareful consideration of plan liabilities, the\nplan\u2019s funded status and our financial\ncondition. Investment performance and asset\nallocation are measured and monitored on a\ndaily basis.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our plan\nassets totaled $ 241million and $ 227million,\nrespectively. We invested substantially all\nour plan assets in common collective trusts,\nwhich primarily consist of domestic and\ninternational equity securities, government\nsecurities and corporate and municipal bonds.\nOur plan assets were classified as Level 2 in\nthe fair value hierarchy as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022.

We record valuation allowances to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount that\nis more likely than not to be realized. We\nrecord the effect of remeasuring deferred tax\nassets and liabilities due to a change in tax\nrates or laws as a component of income tax\nexpense related to continuing operations for\nthe period in which the change is enacted. We\nrelease income tax effects stranded in AOCI\nwhen an entire portfolio of the type of item\nis sold, terminated or extinguished. Income\ntax benefits are recognized when, based on\ntheir technical merits, they are more likely\nthan not to be sustained upon examination. The\namount recognized is the largest amount of\nbenefit that is more likely than not to be\nrealized upon settlement.\nThe following table presents significant\ncomponents of the provision for income taxes\nattributable to continuing operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nTable 15.1: Significant Components of the\nProvision for Income Taxes Attributable to\nContinuing Operations\n                                              \n                Year                          \n               Ended                          \n  (Dol\u2026       Decem\u2026                          \n  in             31,                          \n  mill\u2026         2023        2022        2021  \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n  Curr\u2026                                       \n  inco\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026    $   1,423    $  2,125    $  2,173  \n  taxes                                       \n  State          382         423         485  \n  taxes                                       \n  Inte\u2026           76         104         152  \n  taxes                                       \n  Total                                       \n  curr\u2026    $   1,881    $  2,652    $  2,810  \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  Defe\u2026                                       \n  inco\u2026                                       \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  (ben\u2026                                       \n  Fede\u2026    $    -547    $   -662    $    490  \n  taxes                                       \n  State         -145        -112          91  \n  taxes                                       \n  Inte\u2026          -31           2          24  \n  taxes                                       \n  Total                                       \n  defe\u2026         -723        -772         605  \n  prov\u2026                                       \n  (ben\u2026                                       \n  Total                                       \n  inco\u2026    $   1,158    $  1,880    $  3,415  \n  tax                                         \n  prov\u2026                                       \n                                              \nThe international income tax provision is\nrelated to pre-tax earnings from foreign\noperations of approximately $ 230million, $\n462million and $ 677million in 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nTotal income tax provision does not reflect\nthe tax effects of items that are included in\nAOCI, which include a tax provision of $\n455million in 2023, and a tax benefit of $\n3.2billion and $ 985million in 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.

and 2022,\nrespectively. These operating loss\ncarryforwards were attributable to\nacquisitions, and all of $ 7million is\nexpected to be utilized. Under IRS rules, our\nability to utilize these losses against future\nincome is limited. The net tax values of our\nstate net operating loss carryforwards were $\n273million and $ 267million as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, and they will\nexpire from 2024 to 2042.

Of the total increase, $ 41million\nis related to the current year increase in our\nforeign tax credit carryforwards that will not\nbe realized prior to expiration and $ 8million\nis related to reducing state net operating\nlosses and interest carryforwards to the\namount we have determined is more likely than\nnot to be realized.\n\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties\nrelated to income taxes as a component of\nincome tax expense.

The fair\nvalue accounting guidance provides a three-\nlevel fair value hierarchy for classifying\nfinancial instruments. This hierarchy is based\non the markets in which the assets or\nliabilities trade and whether the inputs to\nthe valuation techniques used to measure fair\nvalue are observable or unobservable. The fair\nvalue measurement of a financial asset or\nliability is assigned a level based on the\nlowest level of any input that is significant\nto the fair value measurement in its entirety.\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy\nare described below:\n                                              \n              Valuation is based on quoted    \n  Level\u00a01:    prices (unadjusted) in active   \n              markets for identical assets    \n              or liabilities.                 \n              Valuation is based on           \n              observable market-based inputs  \n              other than Level 1 prices,      \n              such as quoted prices for       \n              similar assets or liabilities,  \n  Level\u00a02:    quoted prices in markets that   \n              are not active, or other        \n              inputs that are observable or   \n              can be corroborated by          \n              observable market data for      \n              substantially the full term of  \n              the assets or liabilities.      \n              Valuation is generated from     \n              techniques that use             \n              significant assumptions not     \n              observable in the market.       \n  Level\u00a03:    Valuation techniques include    \n              pricing models, discounted      \n              cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d)               \n              methodologies or similar        \n              techniques.                     \n                                              \nThe accounting guidance for fair value\nmeasurements requires that we maximize the use\nof observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in determining fair value.\nWe consider all available information,\nincluding observable market data, indications\nof market liquidity and orderliness, and our\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and\nsignificant inputs. Based upon the specific\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or\ninstrument category, judgments are made\nregarding the significance of the observable\nor unobservable inputs to the instruments\u2019\nfair value measurement in its entirety. If\nunobservable inputs are considered\nsignificant, the instrument is classified as\nLevel 3. The process for determining fair\nvalue using unobservable inputs is generally\nmore subjective and involves a high degree of\nmanagement judgment and assumptions. The\naccounting guidance provides for the\nirrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-\ncontract basis, to measure certain financial\nassets and liabilities at fair value at\ninception of the contract and record any\nsubsequent changes in fair value in earnings.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Recurring Basis\nThe following describes the valuation\ntechniques used in estimating the fair value\nof our financial assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThe determination of the leveling of financial\ninstruments in the fair value hierarchy is\nperformed at the end of each reporting period.\nInvestment Securities\nWe measure the fair value of our U.S. Treasury\nsecurities using quoted prices in active\nmarkets. For the majority of securities in\nother investment categories, we utilize\nmultiple vendor pricing services to obtain\nfair value measurements. We use a waterfall of\npricing vendors determined using our annual\nassessment of pricing service performance. A\npricing service may be considered as the\npreferred or primary pricing provider\ndepending on how closely aligned its prices\nare to other vendor prices, and how consistent\nthe prices are with other available market\ninformation. The price of each security is\nconfirmed by comparing such price to other\nvendor prices before it is finalized.\nRMBS and CMBS are generally classified as\nLevel 2 or 3. When significant assumptions are\nnot consistently observable, fair values are\nderived using the best available data. Such\ndata may include quotes provided by dealers,\nvaluation from external pricing services,\nindependent pricing models, or other model-\nbased valuation techniques, for example,\ncalculation of the present values of future\ncash flows incorporating assumptions such as\nbenchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds,\ncredit ratings and losses. Generally, the\nexternal pricing services utilize observable\nmarket data to the extent available. Pricing\nmodels may be used, which can vary by asset\nclass, and may also incorporate available\ntrade, bid and other market information.\nAcross asset classes, information such as\ntrader/dealer inputs, credit spreads, forward\ncurves and prepayment speeds are used to help\ndetermine appropriate valuations. Because many\nfixed income securities do not trade on a\ndaily basis, the pricing models may apply\navailable information through processes such\nas benchmarking curves, grouping securities\nbased on their characteristics and using\nmatrix pricing to prepare valuations. In\naddition, model processes are used by the\npricing services to develop prepayment\nassumptions.\n                                              \n  202    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nWe validate the pricing obtained from the\nprimary pricing providers through comparison\nof pricing to additional sources, including\nother pricing services, dealer pricing\nindications in transaction results and other\ninternal sources. Pricing variances among\ndifferent pricing sources are analyzed.\nAdditionally, on an on-going basis, we request\nmore detailed information from the valuation\nvendors to understand the pricing methodology\nand assumptions used to value the securities.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nWe use both exchange-traded and OTC\nderivatives to manage our interest rate,\nforeign currency and commodity risk exposures.\nWhen quoted market prices are available and\nused to value our exchange-traded derivatives,\nwe classify them as Level 1. However, the\nmajority of our derivatives do not have\nreadily available quoted market prices.\nTherefore, we value most of our derivatives\nusing vendor-based models. We primarily rely\non market observable inputs for these models,\nincluding, for example, interest rate yield\ncurves, credit curves, option volatility and\ncurrency rates. These inputs can vary\ndepending on the type of derivatives and\nnature of the underlying rate, price or index\nupon which the value of the derivative is\nbased. We typically classify derivatives as\nLevel 2 when significant inputs can be\nobserved in a liquid market and the model\nitself does not require significant judgment.\nWhen instruments are traded in less liquid\nmarkets and significant inputs are\nunobservable, such as interest rate swaps\nwhose remaining terms do not correlate with\nmarket observable interest rate yield curves,\nsuch derivatives are classified as Level 3. We\nconsider the impact of credit risk valuation\nadjustments when measuring the fair value of\nderivative contracts in order to reflect the\ncredit quality of the counterparty and our own\ncredit quality. Our internal pricing is\ncompared against additional pricing sources\nsuch as external valuation agents and other\ninternal sources. Pricing variances among\ndifferent pricing sources are analyzed and\nvalidated. These derivatives are included in\nother assets or other liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nLoans Held for Sale\nIn our commercial business, we originate\nmultifamily commercial real estate loans with\nthe intent to sell them to GSEs. We elect the\nfair value option for such loans as part of\nour management of interest rate risk in our\nmultifamily agency business. These held for\nsale loans are valued based on market\nobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nas Level 2. Unrealized gains and losses on\nthese loans are recorded in other non-interest\nincome in our consolidated statements of\nincome.\nRetained Interests in Securitizations\nWe have retained interests in various mortgage\nsecuritizations from previous acquisitions.\nOur retained interests primarily include\ninterest-only bonds and negative amortization\nbonds. We record these retained interests at\nfair value using market indications and\nvaluation models to calculate the present\nvalue of future cash flows. Due to the use of\nsignificant unobservable inputs such as\nprepayment and discount rate assumptions,\nretained interests in securitizations are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Assets\nWe offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan to eligible associates. In\naddition to participant deferrals, we make\ncontributions to the plan. Participants invest\nthese contributions in a variety of publicly\ntraded mutual funds.

Certain of\nthese unobservable inputs will, in isolation,\nhave a directionally consistent impact on the\nfair value of the instrument for a given\nchange in that input. Alternatively, the fair\nvalue of the instrument may move in an\nopposite direction for a given change in\nanother input. In general, an increase in the\ndiscount rate, default rates, loss severity or\ncredit spreads, in isolation, would result in\na decrease in the fair value measurement. In\naddition, an increase in default rates would\ngenerally be accompanied by a decrease in\nrecovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an\nincrease in liquidity spreads, and would lead\nto a decrease in the fair value measurement.\n\nTechniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value\nMeasureme nts\nThe following table presents the significant\nunobservable inputs used to determine the fair\nvalues of our Level 3 financial instruments on\na recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor\npricing services to obtain fair value for our\nsecurities. Several of our vendor pricing\nservices are only able to provide unobservable\ninput information for a limited number of\nsecurities due to software licensing\nrestrictions. Other vendor pricing services\nare able to provide unobservable input\ninformation for all securities for which they\nprovide a valuation. As a result, the\nunobservable input information for the\nsecurities available for sale presented below\nrepresents a composite summary of all\ninformation we are able to obtain. The\nunobservable input information for all other\nLevel 3 financial instruments is based on the\nassumptions used in our internal valuation\nmodels.\n                                              \n

to the nature of the various mortgage\nsecuritization structures in which we have\nretained interests, it is not meaningful to\npresent a consolidated weighted average for\nthe significant unobservable inputs.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\non a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe are required to measure and recognize\ncertain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThese assets are not measured at fair value on\nan ongoing basis but are subject to fair value\nadjustments in certain circumstances (for\nexample, from the application of lower of cost\nor fair value accounting or when we evaluate\nfor impairment). The following describes the\nvaluation techniques used in estimating the\nfair value of our financial assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis.\nNet Loans Held for Investment\nLoans held for investment that are recorded at\nfair value on our consolidated balance sheets\non a nonrecurring basis largely consist of\nimpaired loans for which impairment is\nmeasured based upon the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral. The fair value is\ndetermined using appraisal values that are\nobtained from independent appraisers, broker\npricing opinions or other available market\ninformation, adjusted for the estimated cost\nto sell. Due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs, these\n                                              \n  207    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nloans are classified as Level 3 under the fair\nvalue hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for\nindividually impaired collateralized loans\nheld for investment are recorded in provision\nfor credit losses in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale for which we have not\nelected the fair value option are carried at\nthe lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred\nfees and deferred origination costs, or fair\nvalue. These loans held for sale are valued\nbased on market observable inputs and are\ntherefore classified as Level 2. Fair value\nadjustments to these loans are recorded in\nother non-interest income in our consolidated\nstatements of income.\nOther Assets\nOther assets subject to nonrecurring fair\nvalue measurements include equity investments\naccounted for under the measurement\nalternative, other repossessed assets and\nlong-lived assets held for sale. The assets\nheld for sale are carried at the lower of the\ncarrying amount or fair value less costs to\nsell. The fair value is determined based on\nthe appraisal value, listing price of the\nproperty or collateral provided by independent\nappraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated\ncosts to sell. Due to the use of significant\nunobservable inputs, these assets are\nclassified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy. Fair value adjustments for these\nassets are recorded in other non-interest\nexpense in the consolidated statements of\nincome.\nThe following table presents the carrying\nvalue of the assets measured at fair value on\na nonrecurring basis and still held as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 , and for which a\nnonrecurring fair value measurement was\nrecorded during the year then ended.\nTable 16.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value\nMeasurements\n                                              \n              Dece\u2026                           \n                31,                           \n               2023                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n              Esti\u2026                           \n               Fair                    Total  \n              Value                           \n              Hier\u2026                           \n  (Dol\u2026       Level        Level              \n  in              2            3              \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held     $      0    $     545    $    545  \n  for                                         \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held           37            0          37  \n  for                                         \n  sale                                        \n  Other           0          214         214  \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total    $     37    $     759    $    796  \n                                              \n                                              \n              Dece\u2026                           \n                31,                           \n               2022                           \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n              Esti\u2026                           \n               Fair                    Total  \n              Value                           \n              Hier\u2026                           \n  (Dol\u2026       Level        Level              \n  in              2            3              \n  mill\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held     $      0    $     284    $    284  \n  for                                         \n  inve\u2026                                       \n  Loans                                       \n  held           11            0          11  \n  for                                         \n  sale                                        \n  Other           0          220         220  \n  asse\u2026                                       \n  Total    $     11    $     504    $    515  \n                                              \n__________\n(1) As of December 31, 2023, other assets\nincluded investments accounted for under\nmeasurement alternative of $ 46million,\nrepossessed assets of $ 45million, and long-\nlived assets held for sale and right-of-use\nassets totaling $ 123million.

The operations of acquired\nbusinesses have been integrated into or\nmanaged as a part of our existing business\nsegments.

Our customers typically include\ncompanies with annual revenues between $\n20million and $ 2billion.\n\u2022 Other category: Includes the residual impact\nof the allocation of our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group activities, such as management\nof our corporate investment portfolio,\nasset/liability management and oversight of\nour funds transfer pricing process, to our\nbusiness segments. Accordingly, net gains and\nlosses on our investment securities portfolio\nand certain trading activities are included in\nthe Other category. The Other category also\nincludes unallocated corporate expenses that\ndo not directly support the operations of the\nbusiness segments or for which the business\nsegments are not considered financially\naccountable in evaluating their performance,\nsuch as certain restructuring charges, as well\nas residual tax expense or benefit to arrive\nat the consolidated effective tax rate that is\nnot assessed to our primary business segments.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe report the results of each of our business\nsegments on a continuing operations basis. The\nresults of our individual businesses reflect\nthe manner in which management evaluates\nperformance and makes decisions about funding\nour operations and allocating resources.\nBusiness Segment Reporting Methodology\nThe results of our business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were\na stand-alone business. Our internal\nmanagement and reporting process used to\nderive our segment results employs various\nallocation methodologies, including funds\ntransfer pricing, to assign certain balance\nsheet assets, deposits and other liabilities\nand their related revenues and expenses\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to each\nbusiness segment. Our funds transfer pricing\nprocess managed by our centralized Corporate\nTreasury group provides a funds credit for\nsources of funds, such as deposits generated\nby our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking\nbusinesses, and a charge for the use of funds\nby each segment. The allocation is unique to\neach business segment and acquired business\nand is based on the composition of assets and\nliabilities. The funds transfer pricing\nprocess considers the interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics of assets and\nliabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically the methodology and assumptions\nutilized in the funds transfer pricing process\nare adjusted to reflect economic conditions\nand other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the\nbusiness segments. Due to the integrated\nnature of our business segments, estimates and\njudgments have been made in allocating certain\nrevenue and expense items. Transactions\nbetween segments are based on specific\ncriteria or approximate market rates. We\nregularly assess the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications\nused for segment reporting, which may result\nin the implementation of refinements or\nchanges in future periods.\nThe following is additional information on the\nprinciples and methodologies used in preparing\nour business segment results.\n\u2022 Net interest income: Interest income from\nloans held for investment and interest expense\nfrom deposits and other interest-bearing\nliabilities are reflected within each\napplicable business segment. Because funding\nand asset/liability management are managed\ncentrally by our Corporate Treasury group, net\ninterest income for our business segments also\n                                              \n  211    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nincludes the results of a funds transfer\npricing process that is intended to allocate a\ncost of funds used or credit for funds\nprovided to all business segment assets and\nliabilities, respectively, using a matched\nfunding concept. The taxable-equivalent\nbenefit of tax-exempt products is also\nallocated to each business unit with a\ncorresponding increase in income tax expense.\n\n\u2022 Non-interest income: Non-interest fees and\nother revenue associated with loans or\ncustomers managed by each business segment and\nother direct revenues are accounted for within\neach business segment.\n\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses: The provision\nfor credit losses is directly attributable to\nthe business segment in accordance with the\nloans each business segment manages.\n\n\u2022 Non-interest expense: Non-interest expenses\ndirectly managed and incurred by a business\nsegment are accounted for within each business\nsegment. We allocate certain non-interest\nexpenses indirectly incurred by business\nsegments, such as corporate support functions,\nto each business segment based on various\nfactors, including the actual cost of the\nservices from the service providers, the\nutilization of the services, the number of\nemployees or other relevant factors.\n\n\u2022 Goodwill and other intangible assets:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are\nassigned to one or more segments at\nacquisition. Intangible amortization is\nincluded in the results of the applicable\nsegment.\n\n\u2022 Income taxes: Income taxes are assessed for\neach business segment based on a standard tax\nrate with the residual tax expense or benefit\nto arrive at the consolidated effective tax\nrate included in the Other category.\n\n\u2022 Loans held for investment: Loans are\nreported within each business segment based on\nproduct or customer type served by that\nbusiness segment.\n\n\u2022 Deposits: Deposits are reported within each\nbusiness segment based on product or customer\ntype served by that business segment.\nSegment Results and Reconciliation\nWe may periodically change our business\nsegments or reclassify business segment\nresults based on modifications to our\nmanagement reporting methodologies or changes\nin organizational alignment.

Interchange\nfees are primarily from our Credit Card\nbusiness and are recognized upon settlement\nwith the interchange networks, net of rewards\nearned by customers. Service charges and other\ncustomer-related fees within our Consumer\nBanking business are primarily related to fees\nearned on consumer deposit accounts for\naccount maintenance and various transaction-\nbased services such as automated teller\nmachine (\u201cATM\u201d) usage. Service charges and\nother customer-related fees within our\nCommercial Banking business are mostly related\nto fees earned on treasury management and\ncapital markets services. Other contract\nrevenue in our Credit Card business consists\nprimarily of revenue from our partnership\narrangements. Other contract revenue in our\nConsumer Banking business consists primarily\nof revenue earned on certain marketing and\npromotional events from our auto dealers.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is\nincluded in non-interest income in our\nconsolidated statements of income.\nThe following table presents revenue from\ncontracts with customers and a reconciliation\nto non-interest income by business segment for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021.\nTable 17.2: Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers and Reconciliation to Segment\nResults\n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $   2    $  \u2026  \n         0       86       \u2026       -2       \u2026  \n         \u2026       1\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       5\u2026       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       34       \u2026       15       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026    $  15    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n  214    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  3\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -1    $  \u2026  \n         0       91       \u2026        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       74       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         \u2026       4\u2026       \u2026       -2       \u2026  \n         \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  4\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n                                              \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n         \u2026                                    \n \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \n         \u2026       C\u2026       \u2026       O\u2026       \u2026  \n         \u2026       B\u2026       \u2026                \u2026  \n                                              \n      $  \u2026    $  2\u2026    $  \u2026    $   0    $  \u2026  \n         0       1\u2026       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         \u2026       75       5        0       \u2026  \n         \u2026       5\u2026       \u2026       -1       \u2026  \n         \u2026       41       \u2026       -\u2026       \u2026  \n      $  \u2026    $  5\u2026    $  \u2026    $  -\u2026    $  \u2026  \n                                              \n__________\n\n(1) Some of our commercial investments\ngenerate tax-exempt income, tax credits or\nother tax benefits.

The contractual\namount of these commitments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to us should the\ncounterparty draw upon the commitment. We\ngenerally manage the potential risk of\nunfunded lending commitments by limiting the\ntotal amount of arrangements, monitoring the\nsize and maturity structure of these\nportfolios and applying the same credit\nstandards for all of our credit activities.\nFor unused credit card lines, we have not\nexperienced and do not anticipate that all of\nour customers will access their entire\navailable line at any given point in time.\nCommitments to extend credit other than credit\ncard lines generally require customers to\nmaintain certain credit standards. Collateral\nrequirements and loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios\nare the same as those for funded transactions\nand are established based on management\u2019s\ncredit assessment of the customer. These\ncommitments may expire without being drawn\nupon; therefore, the total commitment amount\ndoes not necessarily represent future funding\nrequirements.\nWe also issue letters of credit, such as\nfinancial standby, performance standby and\ncommercial letters of credit, to meet the\nfinancing needs of our customers. Standby\nletters of credit are conditional commitments\nissued by us to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party in a borrowing\narrangement. Commercial letters of credit are\nshort-term commitments issued primarily to\nfacilitate trade finance activities for\ncustomers and are generally collateralized by\nthe goods being shipped to the customer. These\ncollateral requirements are similar to those\nfor funded transactions and are established\nbased on management\u2019s credit assessment of the\ncustomer. Management conducts regular reviews\nof all outstanding letters of credit and the\nresults of these reviews are considered in\nassessing the adequacy of reserves for\nunfunded lending commitments.\nThe following table presents the contractual\namount and carrying value of our unfunded\nlending commitments as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022.

For those loss sharing agreements\nentered into as of and prior to December 31,\n2019, we amortize the liability recorded at\ninception into non-interest income as we are\nreleased from risk of having to make a payment\nand record our estimate of expected credit\nlosses each period through the provision for\ncredit losses in our consolidated statements\nof income. The liability recognized on our\nconsolidated balance sheets for these loss\nsharing agreements was $ 137million and $\n82million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. See \u201cNote 4\u2014Allowance for Credit\nLosses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending\nCommitments\u201d for information related to our\ncredit card partnership loss sharing\narrangements.\n                                              \n  216    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nLitigation\n\nIn accordance with the current accounting\nstandards for loss contingencies, we establish\nreserves for litigation related matters that\narise from the ordinary course of our business\nactivities when it is probable that a loss\nassociated with a claim or proceeding has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. None of the amounts we\ncurrently have recorded individually or in the\naggregate are considered to be material to our\nfinancial condition. Litigation claims and\nproceedings of all types are subject to many\nuncertain factors that generally cannot be\npredicted with assurance. Below we provide a\ndescription of potentially material legal\nproceedings and claims.\n\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, we\nare able to estimate reasonably possible\nlosses above existing reserves, and for other\ndisclosed matters, such an estimate is not\npossible at this time. For those matters below\nwhere an estimate is possible, management\ncurrently estimates the reasonably possible\nfuture losses beyond our reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2023 are approximately $\n200million. Our reserve and reasonably\npossible loss estimates involve considerable\njudgment and reflect that there is still\nsignificant uncertainty regarding numerous\nfactors that may impact the ultimate loss\nlevels. Notwithstanding, our attempt to\nestimate a reasonably possible range of loss\nbeyond our current accrual levels for some\nlitigation matters based on current\ninformation, it is possible that actual future\nlosses will exceed both the current accrual\nlevel and the range of reasonably possible\nlosses disclosed here. Given the inherent\nuncertainties involved in these matters,\nespecially those involving governmental\nagencies, and the very large or indeterminate\ndamages sought in some of these, there is\nsignificant uncertainty as to the ultimate\nliability we may incur from these litigation\nmatters and an adverse outcome in one or more\nof these matters could be material to our\nresults of operations or cash flows for any\nparticular reporting period.\nInterchange Litigation\nIn 2005, a putative class of retail merchants\nfiled antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard\nand Visa and several issuing banks, including\nCapital One, seeking both injunctive relief\nand monetary damages for an alleged conspiracy\nby defendants to fix the level of interchange\nfees. The networks and issuing banks entered\ninto settlement and judgment sharing\nagreements allocating the liabilities of any\njudgment or settlement arising from all\ninterchange-related cases.\n\nThe lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New\nYork for certain purposes and were settled in\n2012. The class settlement, however, was\ninvalidated by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit in June 2016,\nand the suit was bifurcated into separate\nclass actions seeking injunctive and monetary\nrelief, respectively. In addition, numerous\nmerchant groups opted out of the 2012\nsettlement.\n\nThe monetary relief class action settled for\n$5.5 billion. The settlement received final\napproval from the district court in December\n2019. The Second Circuit affirmed the\nsettlement in March 2023, and it is now final.\nSome of the merchants that opted out of the\nmonetary relief class have brought cases, and\nsome of those cases have settled and some\nremain pending. Visa created a litigation\nescrow account following its initial public\noffering of stock in 2008 that funds the\nportion of these settlements attributable to\nVisa-allocated transactions. Any settlement\namounts based on MasterCard-allocated\ntransactions that have not already been paid\nare reflected in our reserves. The claims by\nthe injunctive relief class have not been\nresolved.\n\nCybersecurity Incident\n\nOn July 29, 2019, we announced that on March\n22 and 23, 2019 an outside individual gained\nunauthorized access to our systems. This\nindividual obtained certain types of personal\ninformation relating to people who had applied\nfor our credit card products and to our credit\ncard customers (the \u201c2019 Cybersecurity\nIncident\u201d). As a result of the 2019\nCybersecurity Incident, we have been subject\nto numerous legal proceedings and other\ninquiries and could be the subject of\nadditional proceedings and inquiries in the\nfuture.\n\nConsumer class actions . We are named as a\ndefendant in 5putative consumer class action\ncases in Canadian courts alleging harm from\nthe 2019 Cybersecurity Incident and seeking\nvarious remedies, including monetary and\ninjunctive relief. The lawsuits allege breach\nof contract, negligence, violations of various\nprivacy laws and a variety of other legal\ncauses of action. In August 2021, a trial\ncourt in Ontario dismissed with prejudice one\nof these putative class actions, and on\nJanuary 31, 2024, the Court of Appeals of\nOntario affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision.\nThe Plaintiffs have sixty days to seek leave\nto appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of\nCanada should they seek an appeal. In the\nsecond quarter of 2022, a trial court in\nBritish Columbia preliminarily certified a\nclass of all impacted Canadian consumers\nexcept those in Quebec, which would allow the\ncase to proceed with discovery on a classwide\nbasis. The preliminary certification decision\nin British Columbia has been appealed. In the\nthird quarter of 2023, a trial court in Quebec\npreliminarily authorized a class of all\nimpacted consumers in\n                                              \n  217    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nQuebec. This decision also has been appealed.\nThe final two putative class actions, both of\nwhich are pending in Alberta, are continuing\nin parallel, but remain at a preliminary\nstage.\n\nGovernmental inquiries. In August 2020, we\nentered into consent orders with the Federal\nReserve and the OCC resulting from regulatory\nreviews of the 2019 Cybersecurity Incident and\nrelating to ongoing enhancements of our\ncybersecurity and operational risk management\nprocesses. We paid an $ 80million penalty to\nthe U.S. Treasury as part of the OCC\nagreement. The Federal Reserve agreement did\nnot contain a monetary penalty. The OCC lifted\nits consent order on August 31, 2022 and the\nFederal Reserve lifted its consent order on\nJuly 5, 2023. Canada\u2019s Office of Privacy\nCommissioner\u2019s (\u201cOPC\u201d) investigation into the\n2019 Cybersecurity Incident is still open.\n\nWalmart Litigation\n\nOn April 7, 2023, Walmart filed a lawsuit in\nthe Southern District of New York seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment that it has the\ncontractual right to early termination of the\ncredit card partnership agreement under which\nwe are the exclusive issuer of Walmart\u2019s\nprivate label and co-branded credit card\nprogram in the U.S. and share in certain\nrelated economics. On May 2, 2023, Walmart\nfiled an amended complaint in which it also\nalleges breach of contract and seeks damages\ncaused by any delay in termination. On May 4,\n2023, we filed an Answer and Counterclaim to\nWalmart\u2019s amended complaint, denying that\nWalmart has any right to terminate the\npartnership and alleging that Walmart has\nbreached its contractual obligations to\nCapital One.\n\nU.K. PPI Litigation\n\nIn the U.K., we previously sold payment\nprotection insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d). For several\nyears leading up to the claims submission\ndeadline of August 29, 2019 (as set by the\nU.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d)), we\nreceived customer complaints and regulatory\nclaims relating to PPI. COEP has materially\nresolved the PPI complaints and regulatory\nclaims received prior to the deadline. Some of\nthe claimants in the U.K. PPI regulatory\nclaims process have subsequently initiated\nlegal proceedings, seeking additional redress.\nWe are responding to these proceedings as we\nreceive them.\n\nSavings Account Litigation\n\nIn July 2023, Capital One was sued in a\nputative class action in the Eastern District\nof Virginia by savings account holders\nalleging breach of contract and a variety of\nother causes of action relating to Capital\nOne\u2019s introduction of a new savings account\nproduct with a higher interest rate than\nexisting savings account products. On November\n9, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss the\nlawsuit. In February 2024, Capital One was\nsued in similar putative class actions in the\nCentral District of California and the\nSouthern District of Ohio alleging breach of\ncontract and other causes of action. Capital\nOne intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nlawsuits.\n\nOther Pending and Threatened Litigation\n\nIn addition, we are commonly subject to\nvarious pending and threatened legal actions\nrelating to the conduct of our normal business\nactivities. In the opinion of management, the\nultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising\nout of all such other pending or threatened\nlegal actions is not expected to be material\nto our consolidated financial position or our\nresults of operations.\n\nOther Contingencies\n\nDeposit Insurance Assessments\n\nOn November 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a\nrule to implement a special assessment to\nrecover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund\n(\u201cDIF\u201d) arising from the protection of\nuninsured depositors in connection with the\nsystemic risk determination announced on March\n12, 2023, following the closures of Silicon\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC will\ncollect the special assessment at an annual\nrate of approximately 13.4 basis points\n(\u201cbps\u201d) over eight quarterly assessment\nperiods, beginning with the first quarter of\n2024 with the first payment due on June 28,\n2024. The FDIC may shorten or extend the\nassessment period based on adjustments to its\nloss estimates for the resolutions of Silicon\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. The special\nassessment base is equal to an insured\ndepository institution\u2019s estimated uninsured\ndeposits reported on its Consolidated Reports\nof Condition and Income as of December 31,\n2022 (\u201c2022 Call Report\u201d), adjusted to exclude\nthe first $5 billion of uninsured deposits. We\nrecognized $ 289million in operating expense\nin the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with\nthe special assessment based on our 2022 Call\nReport, which was revised and refiled during\n2023.\n                                              \n  218    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n                                              \nTable of Contents\n                                              \n      CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION       \n                                              \n                                              \n       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL        \n       STATEMENTS                             \n                                              \nIn the preamble to the final rule, the FDIC\nannounced that it will conduct a review of the\nreporting methodology for estimated uninsured\ndeposits and related items. It is reasonably\npossible amendments will be needed to our 2022\nCall Report due to legal and regulatory\ndevelopments, which could result in additional\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment that we estimate could be as much\nas $ 150million. The ultimate amount of\nexpenses associated with the special\nassessment will also be impacted by the\nfinalization of the losses incurred by the\nFDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank\nand Signature Bank.\n                                              \n  219    Capital One Financial Corporation    \n         (COF)                                \n
