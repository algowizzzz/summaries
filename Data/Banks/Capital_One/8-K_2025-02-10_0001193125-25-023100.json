The Merger Agreement provides \nthat, upon the terms and subject to the       \nconditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, \n(a) Merger Sub will merge with and into       \nDiscover (the \u201cMerger\u201d), with Discover        \ncontinuing as the surviving corporation in the\nMerger; (b) immediately following the Merger, \nDiscover, as the surviving entity, will merge \nwith and into Capital One (the \u201cSecond Step   \nMerger\u201d and together with the Merger, the     \n\u201cMergers\u201d), with Capital One continuing as the\nsurviving corporation in the Second Step      \nMerger; and (c) immediately following the     \nSecond Step Merger, Discover Bank, a wholly-  \nowned Delaware-chartered bank subsidiary of   \nDiscover, will merge with and into Capital    \nOne\u2019s wholly owned national bank subsidiary,  \nCapital One, National Association (the \u201cBank  \nMerger\u201d and together with the Merger and the  \nSecond Step Merger, the \u201cTransaction\u201d), with  \nCapital One, National Association continuing  \nas the surviving entity in the Bank Merger.   \nThe Merger Agreement was unanimously approved \nby the board of directors of each of Capital  \nOne and Discover. In connection with the      \nproposed Mergers, Capital One filed with the  \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d)\na registration statement on Form S-4containing\na joint proxy statement/prospectus, as        \namended, and filed a definitive joint proxy   \nstatement/prospectus with the SEC dated       \nJanuary 6, 2025 (the \u201cjoint proxy             \nstatement/prospectus\u201d), which Capital One and \nDiscover first mailed to their respective     \nstockholders on or about January 6, 2025. Each\nof Capital One and Discover will hold a       \nspecial meeting of stockholders on February   \n18, 2025 to consider certain proposals related\nto the Merger Agreement as further described  \nin the joint proxy statement/prospectus (the  \n\u201cSpecial Meetings\u201d). Pursuant to the Merger   \nAgreement, subject to the receipt of the      \nrequisite stockholder approvals at the Special\nMeetings, and as a result of the closing      \nconditions related to the requisite regulatory\napprovals not yet having been satisfied, the  \noutside date under the Merger Agreement will  \nbe automatically extended to May 19, 2025.    \nLitigation Related to the Mergers Following   \nthe announcement of the Merger Agreement, as  \nof the date of this Current Report on Form    \n8-K,three lawsuits challenging the Mergers    \nhave been filed (each, a \u201cLawsuit\u201d and,       \ncollectively, the \u201cLawsuits\u201d). The first      \nLawsuit, captioned Siegelv. Duncan et al.(No. \n2025CH00000020), was filed in Illinois Circuit\nCourt on January 27, 2025. The second Lawsuit,\nStonev. Discover Financial Services et al.(No.\n650327/2025) was filed in New York Superior   \nCourt on January 29, 2025. The third Lawsuit, \nCollinsv. Discover Financial Services et      \nal.(No. 650550/2025) was filed in New York    \nSuperior Court on January 29, 2025. In        \naddition, Capital One and Discover have       \nreceived demand letters from counsel          \nrepresenting purported stockholders of Capital\nOne or Discover, respectively (the \u201cDemand    \nLetters\u201d and, together with the Lawsuits, the \n\u201cMatters\u201d). The Matters each allege that,     \namong other things, the joint proxy           \nstatement/prospectus contains certain         \ndisclosure deficiencies and/or incomplete     \ninformation regarding the Mergers. Capital One\nand Discover believe that the claims asserted \nin the Matters are without merit and          \nsupplemental disclosures are not required or  \nnecessary under applicable laws. However, in  \norder to avoid the risk that the Matters delay\nor otherwise adversely affect the Mergers, and\nto minimize the costs, risks and uncertainties\ninherent in litigation, and without admitting \nany liability or wrongdoing, Capital One and  \nDiscover are supplementing the joint proxy    \nstatement/prospectus as described in this     \nCurrent Report on Form 8-K.Nothing in this    \nCurrent Report on Form 8-Kshall be deemed an  \nadmission of the legal necessity or           \nmateriality under applicable laws of any of   \nthe disclosures set forth herein. To the      \ncontrary, Capital One and Discover            \nspecifically deny all allegations in the      \nMatters that any additional disclosure was or \nis required. Supplemental Disclosures to Joint\nProxy Statement/Prospectus The additional     \ndisclosures (the \u201csupplemental disclosures\u201d)  \nin this Current Report on Form 8-Ksupplement  \nthe disclosures contained in the joint proxy  \nstatement/prospectus and should be read in    \nconjunction with the disclosures contained in \nthe joint proxy statement/prospectus, which   \nshould be read in its entirety. To the extent \nthat 1                                        \n                                              \ninformation set forth in the supplemental     \ndisclosures differs from or updates           \ninformation contained in the joint proxy      \nstatement/prospectus, the information in this \nCurrent Report on Form 8-Kshall supersede or  \nsupplement the information contained in the   \njoint proxy statement/prospectus. All page    \nreferences are to the joint proxy             \nstatement/prospectus and terms used but not   \notherwise defined herein shall have the       \nmeanings ascribed to such terms in the joint  \nproxy statement/prospectus.

Mr. Maheras,\nreferring to the discussions with Capital One,\ninformed the directors of his view that one   \nsuch inquiry likely merited further           \nconsideration, whereas the other inquiries had\nthus far largely been speculative inquiries   \nfrom investment bankers. For the sake of      \nefficiency given the circumstances, the board \ndetermined to assemble a subset of            \nindependentdirectors to take the lead on      \nevaluating actionable inquiries and pursuing  \ndiscussions in advance of further             \nconsideration of such inquiries by the board. \nFollowing this meeting, this subset of        \nindependentdirectors was identified and it    \nincluded Mr. Maheras, Jeffrey Aronin, Gregory \nCase, Michael Shepherd and Mark Thierer (such \ndirectors collectively, the \u201cDiscover director\nsubgroup\u201d). On October 3, 2023, the Discover  \ndirector subgroup met as a group for the first\ntime, and Mr. Maheras updated the Discover    \ndirector subgroup on the inquiries received   \nand discussions held to date, including those \nwith Capital One.                             \n                                              \n      The disclosure under the heading \u201cThe   \n      Mergers\u2014Background of the Mergers\u201d in   \n  2.  the joint proxy statement/prospectus    \n      is hereby supplemented by amending and  \n      restating the second full paragraph on  \n      Page 65 as follows:                     \n                                              \nThroughout the period between February 13,    \n2024 and February 18, 2024, the parties and   \ntheir advisors continued their due diligence  \nmeetings and negotiation of the terms of the  \npotential transaction. Representatives of     \nWachtell Lipton and Sullivan & Cromwell       \nexchanged numerous drafts of the merger       \nagreement reflecting various comments from the\nparties and these meetings and discussions.   \nWachtell Lipton\u2019s February 15, 2024 draft of  \nthe merger agreement proposed that the amount \nof the termination fee, payable if the merger \nagreement is terminated in certain            \ncircumstances involving alternative           \nacquisition proposals or changes in the       \nCapital One board recommendation or the       \nDiscover board recommendation, equal 4.0% of  \ntransaction equity value. Sullivan &          \nCromwell\u2019s February 16, 2024 draft of the     \nmerger agreement proposed that the termination\nfee amount equal 3.9% of transaction equity   \nvalue. The parties subsequently agreed to a   \ntermination fee amount equal to $1.38 billion,\nequivalent to approximately 3.9% of $35.3     \nbillion, the aggregate value of the merger    \nconsideration based on the closing price of   \nCapital One common stock on the NYSE on       \nFebruary 16, 2024, the last trading day before\nthe public announcement of the mergers.

Discover accepted Capital One\u2019s      \nproposal that the merger agreement provide for\na termination date 12 months following the    \nexecution of the merger agreement, to be      \nautomatically extended an additional three    \nmonths in certain circumstances for purposes  \nof obtaining the requisite regulatory         \napprovals. The parties engaged in detailed    \ndiscussions with respect to the merger        \nagreement\u2019s interim operating covenants given \nthe contemplated period between the signing   \nand closing of the potential transaction, with\nthese discussions focusing on Discover\u2019s      \nability to undertake additional borrowings,   \nenter into certain types of material          \nagreements and settle litigation and the      \nplanned disposition of Discover\u2019s student loan\nportfolio, as well as Discover employment and \ncompensation matters. With respect to         \ncompensation matters, the parties ultimately  \nagreed that Discover would be permitted to    \ntake certain actions during the period between\nthe signing and closing of the potential      \ntransaction, including permitting Discover to \nestablish a cash retention program, provide   \nimpacted individuals with Section 280G excise \ntax gross-upprotection (subject to an         \naggregate limit of $25 million) and enter into\n\u201cgood reason\u201d acknowledgement letters with    \ncertain of its executive officers, which      \npermitted compensation actions are described  \nin further detail in the section entitled \u201c   \nThe Mergers\u2014Interests of Discover\u2019s Directors \nand Executive Officers in the Mergers \u201d       \nbeginning on page 96.
